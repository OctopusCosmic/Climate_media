I'm in favor of taking action to reduce CO2 emissions and to protect our environment. But I don't support the ""cap-and-trade"" plan now being debated in Congress.
\
""Cap-and-trade"" is an approach that would have the government set caps on carbon emissions from certain sources, and then establish a market in which allowances for CO2 emissions would be bought and sold on a financial exchange. Supporters call it a ""market-based solution.""
\
I think it is the wrong solution and I don't support it.
\
I support capping carbon emissions. But it has to be done the right way, with targets and timelines that allow us to accomplish our goals without driving the cost of energy for homeowners and businesses out of sight. The cap-and-trade plan does not meet that test for me.
\
I know the Wall Street crowd can't wait to sink their teeth into a new trillion-dollar trading market in which hedge funds and investment banks would trade and speculate on carbon credits and securities. In no time they'll create derivatives, swaps and more in that new market. In fact, most of the investment banks have already created carbon trading departments. They are ready to go. I'm not.
\
For those who like the wild price swings in the oil futures market, the unseemly speculation in mortgage-backed securities, or the exotic and risky financial products like credit default swaps that pushed our economy into the ditch, this cap-and-trade plan will be the answer to their prayers.
\
Just last year, speculators overwhelmed the oil futures market, every day trading 20 to 25 times more oil than was being produced. That speculation drove the price of oil from $60 to $147 a barrel and gasoline to over $4 a gallon. The same speculators forced the price back down and made money in both directions. The American public paid the price for it.
\
Don't get me wrong. I like free markets. But given recent history, I have little confidence that large financial markets are free or fair enough to trust them with a new, large cap-and-trade carbon securities market.
\
I'm willing to cap carbon to address the threat to our environment. But it has to be done right. I will support a plan that establishes workable caps, invests in technology to decarbonize fossil fuels and sends the majority of the revenue raised to consumers to offset increases in the price of electricity resulting from the caps.
\
Energy is an important part of our lives. We need to work to decarbonize the use of coal so that we can use our most abundant fossil energy resource. We have to maximize the development of renewable energy. Green, renewable energy protects our environment and it also makes us less dependent on foreign oil (70 percent of our oil comes from other countries).
\
Here's what we need to do to protect our environment and make us less dependent on foreign oil:
\
1. Establish caps on carbon that are accompanied by both adequate research and development funding and reasonable timelines for implementation to develop and commercialize technologies that will greatly reduce the CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.
\
2. Use the majority of the revenue from a plan that caps CO2 to provide refund payments to those who would otherwise experience increased energy costs.
\
3. Even as we continue to decarbonize the use of fossil energy, we should maximize the production of renewable energy from wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, and more.
\
4. Set an ambitious renewable electricity standard (RES) along with longer-term tax incentives for the wind, solar, biomass and other renewable energy.
\
5. To move this new energy, we need to build a transmission system to allow us to produce renewable energy where we can, and move it to the load centers where it is needed.
\
6. To reap the benefits of cleaner energy and reduced dependence on foreign oil, we need to move toward using electricity to fuel our transportation fleet.
\
North Dakota and the nation have a lot at stake in this debate. We are a major energy-producing state, with our ability to produce large quantities of oil and our large deposits of coal, which is our country's most abundant form of energy. We have the greatest wind energy potential of any state, and we have the ability to produce a large quantity of biofuels.
\
It's clear we are going to have to use energy differently in the future to protect our planet. And to do that I will support a plan that puts achievable caps on CO2 emissions - if it is done the right way.
\
But I'm not signing up to create a new financial market to trade carbon securities. In my judgment, it is exactly the wrong way to address this issue.

Public Service Commissioner Brian Kalk continued to speak out against the so-called cap-and-trade bill before Congress in two speeches in Fargo and Minot on Tuesday.
\
The three-member PSC in May said the sweeping energy policy, which passed the U.S. House in June with Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., voting no, would double electricity bills for North Dakota consumers. Kalk said the bill should be defeated in the Senate.
\
Under the legislation, the federal government over time would enact limits on carbon dioxide emissions, believed by some to be a leading cause of rising temperatures and climate change around the globe.
\
If the current legislation becomes law, utilities and other industrial carbon dioxide emitters could then buy or sell carbon emission allowances on a specialized market.
\
Kalk said policy would financially hamper states like North Dakota, where 95 percent of its power comes from coal, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Coal, a major contributor to carbon dioxide emissions, also makes up about half of the nation's energy supply.
\
""It is a flawed bill which will drive up energy costs without any true environmental benefit,"" said Kalk, a Republican serving his first term on the PSC. ""If passed into law, it will have a devastating impact on our state and nation.""
\
The Senate will eventually take up the energy bill that includes the cap-and-trade provision, which recently passed the U.S. House. The Senate bill is likely to be different than the House version.
\
North Dakota Democratic Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad say the energy policy should include more protections for the agriculture and coal industries.
\
Dorgan, a senior member on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said Tuesday that he opposes the cap-and-trade provision in the House bill.
\
""The trade piece of cap-and-trade will have investment banks creating carbon securities,"" Dorgan said. ""Once again, we'll be back in a marketplace of speculation.""
\
He said that could lead to similar situations like last summer, when speculators drove the cost of oil to more than $140 per barrel.
\
Instead, Dorgan said he would support a ""cap-and-dividend"" policy, which would ""reasonably"" limit carbon emissions based on available technology, and then charge a fee to emitters who don't follow the restrictions. The money would be given to the public, he said.
\
Conrad told the Minot Daily News last week that the House improved some aspects of the original cap-and-trade legislation, but added, ""I would have a very hard time voting for this bill without additional changes that would take account of special circumstances in our state.""
\
Kalk said the speeches were not official business for the Public Service Commission and that he decided to make them because he feels strongly about the issue. He said no taxpayer dollars were used to make the speeches.
\
""There's no political ambition behind this whatsoever,"" Kalk said. ""I'm speaking as a public service commissioner.""
\
Fellow Republican commissioners Kevin Cramer and Tony Clark did not participate.
\
Kalk said Congress should enact a national energy policy that would promote fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, and renewable energy sources, while funding research on ways to store and transmit energy more efficiently.
\
""We have to acknowledge that fossil fuels are here to stay,"" Kalk said. ""We have unlimited amounts of gas and oil. There's no way to be energy independent with the use of these resources.""
\
As a member of the Senate energy committee, Dorgan added language last month to an energy bill that would require 15 percent of power companies' energy to stem from renewable sources by 2021 and push for improvements to nation's power grid.
\
National Farmers Union President Roger Johnson sent a letter Tuesday to Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and its ranking Republican member, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.
\
Johnson, North Dakota's former agriculture commissioner, said the NFU supports the cap-and-trade concept, but would also like to see any carbon offset program for the agriculture industry controlled by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, among other provisions.
\
The legislation is primarily sponsored by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Energy Committee, and Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass.
\
Dorgan said Senate is expected to take up the energy bill in October.

Cap-and-trade has fallen from the Senate's agenda for now, but utilities, regulators and lawmakers are looking for direction from Washington on energy and climate issues.
\
""If we don't get a baseline energy policy, that could hurt the whole country,"" said Public Service Commissioner Brian Kalk. ""I still think there's room for a good energy bill to move forward.""
\
Senate leaders acknowledged recently that they do not have the support to pass a comprehensive bill on energy and the environment that would include a cap-and-trade system aimed at reducing greenhouse gases. That means that Congress will not impose emissions restrictions that critics say would unfairly target coal-burning utilities. That still leaves the door open for the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate carbon gas without a new law, and it does not provide any new guidance on where carbon emissions standards should be and how utilities should get there.
\
""By and large, people in the industry understand the importance of reducing carbon emissions,"" said Rick Matteson, spokesman for MDU Resources Group.
\
What the industry has not agreed with is the immediate imposition of restrictions on carbon emissions, which have been linked to global warming. The coal industry has advocated giving utilities more time and support to develop practical ways of reducing the amount of carbon dioxide that enters the atmosphere.
\
""In the long run, Congress should come up with a comprehensive energy policy ... one that sets a direction for where we want to go on a long-term basis,"" said Daryl Hill, spokesman for Basin Electric Power Cooperative, which operates coal plants in the state.
\
Cris Kling, a spokeswoman for Otter Tail Power Company, said a policy should include a renewable energy portfolio and efficiency standards, and even out differences among varying state policies. Otter Tail operates in North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota.
\
The Lignite Energy Council has advocated an energy and climate policy that directs money raised through carbon regulation toward support for research and implementation of carbon reduction technology.
\
Lawmakers can call for reducing carbon emissions, Matteson said, but ""they don't have a magic wand to come up with new technology.""
\
There is also the possibility that failure of the cap-and-trade efforts so far could slow advances in clean energy, and clean coal in particular.
\
John Thompson of the Clean Air Task Force, an environmental research and advocacy group, said that his organization has made recommendations promoting clean coal technology to the president's carbon capture and storage task force, but ""without a climate bill, there's nothing to fund that.""
\
Thompson, who is the head of the task force's coal transition project, also said uncertainty over future emissions standards discourages utilities from investing in new, cleaner coal-fired plants. Among the task force's recommendations are spending $20 billion on new coal plant projects.
\
""The reality is that no one is going to build new plants without this,"" he said, and coal will eventually be replaced by other energy sources.
\
Charlie Bullinger, principal engineer at Great River Energy's Coal Creek Power Plant, said that the coal industry will continue to research and implement cleaner solutions with or without direction from Washington.
\
""If the question is, 'Is research going to stalemate?' my answer is no. We're not waiting for the government's decision to pick levels of carbon,"" said Bullinger, who led the development of Great River's coal drying process to make lignite more efficient. ""There's no reason to stop what we do on the research side.""
\
What will happen with a climate and energy policy is not clear, but there is a possibility that the federal Environmental Protection Agency will regulate carbon emissions without a bill from Congress.
\
Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., has opposed any action on carbon by the EPA, which declared carbon a pollutant last year, meaning the agency had the power to restrict it. He would like to see Congress put a moratorium on any move by the agency.
\
""We should not rely on the EPA's self-restraint,"" he said. ""I don't think they should do any regulation until Congress passes a law.""
\
Pomeroy declined to say if he would support a law that restricts carbon emissions.
\
His opponent in the race for the House of Representatives, Rick Berg, said he supports legislation that encourages new energy production, along the lines of North Dakota's EmPower ND initiative. He said the debate over cap-and-trade has already kept industry from investing.
\
""Until they know what the rules are going to be, they're not going to risk capital on expansion,"" Berg said.
\
Any energy and climate bill will likely fall to the next session of Congress. With the Democrats facing probable losses in November, any new legislation will need to be more palatable to Republicans, putting the chances of a carbon cap in doubt.
\
Marie Hoff of the Dakota Resources Council, an environmental group, said that she believes limits on emissions are still necessary to slow climate change.
\
""I think a cap is necessary because of ... the urgency of controlling greenhouse gases,"" Hoff said. ""That, of course, is necessary from the point of view of science.""

The longer the nation goes without a coherent energy policy, the more difficult it becomes for the country to shift to energy self sufficiency and environmental responsibility.
\
Washington should be aggressive, yet realistic, in creating a sensible energy policy for the nation. The strategies involved need to be clear and make good sense.
\
It must be a policy for all 50 states, giving consideration to their different needs and demands.
\
The North Dakota Public Service Commission recently stepped into the political fray surrounding energy by announcing its opposition to the ""cap-and-trade"" method of reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. The state's three PSC commissioners took ""cap-and-trade"" to task for being a smoke screen for imposing an ""appropriations policy"" rather than being a tool for improving the environment and slowing global warming.
\
The statement taken by the PSC reflects deliberate purpose. The commission held a summit in April, hearing experts and members of the public on cap-and-trade before staking out its position.
\
Essentially, the three PSC commissioners - Kevin Cramer, Tony Clark and Brian Kalk - have got it right.
\
Cap and trade creates an elaborate false economy, whereby utilities with low emissions, under the cap, can sell that perceived benefit to utilities with higher greenhouse gas emissions. It's a strategy loosely related to the ""sin"" taxes on tobacco and alcohol products used to discourage use. We've also heard talk about putting a high tax on gasoline to encourage efficiency and discourage use. These are taxes used to change behavior. With these kinds of taxes, there's no clear cause and effect relationship between government's need for revenue and the level of taxes. It provides a bounty for those wanting to increase spending.
\
Conversely, if the federal government needs to fund a program, the cost is established, a tax created and the level of tax set to raise the needed money.
\
Who would really pay the sin tax in this case?
\
It would be the utilities, which means the people of North Dakota and the end-use consumers.
\
The PSC commissioners speculated that a cap-and-trade policy on green house gas emissions would raise electric bills for consumers in North Dakota from between 40 to 100 percent. That's sinful.
\
Part of the motivation behind cap-and-trade comes from those who do not believe the U.S. should transform coal to gas or electricity. They do not believe there's such a thing as clean coal. But the record is clear. With research the utility industry has been able to increase its efficiency and reduce harmful emissions. And it's also clear that much of the nation relies on the burning of coal, and the alternative sources of energy are not mature enough to pick up the load.A national energy policy ought to do better than a sin tax on coal. It ought to give consideration to the role of coal in energy production in much of the country. Energy producers need clear, sensible and stable policies, so that they can continue to provide power to the nation and purse the goal of energy self sufficiency.

Imagine if the government made you spend 20 percent of your family's food budget on asparagus. It might be costlier than other vegetables, but Congress and the president say it's good for you. Asparagus producers are ecstatic - no more competing with other vegetables for your business. And because there's a mandate, they don't even have to worry about lowering costs.
\
Other farmers respond by replacing their less-expensive crops with the costlier, mandated vegetable. In the end, consumers are stuck with less choice and higher prices.
\
Sounds absurd, right? Well, it's what would happen to our electricity bills if Congress passes a Renewable Electricity Standard.
\
An RES would force Americans to purchase a pre-determined percentage of their electricity from certain energy sources that Washington bureaucrats deem acceptable, like wind or solar, which featured prominently in last year's failed cap-and-trade legislation. Tuesday's election likely killed any hopes of Congress passing a cap-and-trade bill anytime soon, but an RES, which has garnered bipartisan support, is still in the cards.
\
Politicians are quick to say that an RES would enable us to have renewable energy without having a cap-and-trade. But like cap- and-trade, it's the equivalent of an energy tax - and an economy killer.
\
Because these electricity sources are expensive, Washington has to force us to buy them. Mandated higher electricity prices ripple throughout the economy. Higher electric bills force families to consume less and dip into their savings. They force businesses to cut production and reduce labor.
\
A Heritage Foundation analysis found that a 15 percent RES by 2020 would destroy more than 1 million jobs as soon as 2017 and reduce gross domestic product by more than $1 trillion.
\
But, say politicians, higher prices are justified. An RES is necessary for America's clean energy economy and securing energy independence.
\
Saying RES will enhance America's energy security is nothing more than an empty talking point. Since electricity comes almost entirely from secure domestic sources, and petroleum provides about 1 percent of our electricity needs, an RES would do almost nothing to decrease our use of foreign energy. It would simply displace cheap electricity with expensive electricity.
\
RES supporters argue that because wind and solar energy are emissions-free, increasing those sources will save the Earth. The reality is, requiring Americans to buy expensive, uncompetitive energy has little, if anything, to do with the environment. A recent study by the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States finds that temporarily reducing coal generation in place of wind generates more greenhouse gases because it causes coal plants to operate inefficiently.
\
RES is more a political instrument for Washington to subsidize powerful special interest groups than a policy to reduce emissions. Otherwise, it would include nuclear power, which provides almost 70 percent of the nation's emissions-free energy.
\
Not that including nuclear energy and carbon capture and sequestration in an RES bill would make it a good idea - Washington has no business in dictating what energy sources Americans use. But excluding them demonstrates the hypocrisy at work here.
\
Too often these mandates are not recognized for what they are: a mechanism to transfer wealth from everyday Americans to industries that politicians believe are worthy. Congress concentrates benefits to the politically connected and disperses the costs to the rest of us.
\
Here is the truly perverse outcome of these policies. Mandating and subsidizing non-competitive technologies crowds out investment for newer, cleaner technologies that could not only help us preserve the environment but do it at an affordable price. The resources used to prop up uncompetitive wind and solar projects could be invested into new emissions-free electricity sources that might be cheaper than fossil fuels. But we'll never know, because we'll be stuck with what the government gave us.
\
Chalk RES up as another policy that will increase the cost of living and curtail liberty for Americans. An RES will eliminate competition, drive prices higher, and encourage government dependence. This isn't an acceptable substitute for cap-and-trade, and any bipartisanship the idea receives doesn't make it a good idea. If some politicians believe wind and solar are economically viable for their respective states, they should work with state legislators to pass something for their state and not allow the rest of America to endure the economic pain of a national RES.

In Pope Francis sprawling new encyclical, Laudato Si, there are many mansions: A meditation on biblical ecology, a discussion of environmental policy, a critique of consumerism, even a reflection on the perils of social media. What everyone wants to know, of course, is whether the pope takes sides in our most polarizing debate. And he clearly does. After this document, theres no doubting where Francis stands in the great argument of our time. But I dont mean the argument between liberalism and conservatism. I mean the argument between dynamists and catastrophists. Dynamists are people who see 21st-century modernity as a basically successful civilization advancing toward a future thats better than the past. They do not deny that problems exist, but they believe we can innovate our way through them while staying on an ever-richer, ever-more-liberated course. Dynamists of the left tend to put their faith in technocratic government; dynamists of the right, in the genius of free markets. But both assume that modernity is a success story whose best days are ahead. Catastrophists, on the other hand, see a global civilization that for all its achievements is becoming more atomized and balkanized, more morally bankrupt, more environmentally despoiled. Whats more, they believe that things cannot go on as they are: That the trajectory were on will end in crisis, disaster, degringolade. Like dynamists, catastrophists can be on the left or right, stressing different agents of our imminent demise. But theyre united in believing that current arrangements are foredoomed, and that only a true revolution can save us. This is Pope Francis position, and the controlling theme of his encyclical. It includes, as many liberals hoped and certain conservatives feared, a call to action against climate change, which will no doubt cause Republicans to squirm during political campaigns to come. But reading Laudato Si simply as a case for taking climate change seriously misses the depth of its critique which extends to the whole technological paradigm of our civilization, all the ways (economic and cultural) that we live now. This is a document aligned with the scientific consensus on climate that excoriates the modern scientific mindset as, in effect, a 500-year mistake. Its a document calling for global action, even a new world political authority, thats drenched in frank contempt for the existing global leadership class. Its a document that urges a rapid move away from fossil fuels while explicitly criticizing the leading avenue for doing so a cap-and-trade regime as too quick and easy, too compromised by greed and self-interest, to allow for the radical change which present circumstances require. And while it includes hopeful passages, the encyclicals most pungent lines are apocalyptic: Doomsday predictions can no longer be met with irony or disdain. We may well be leaving to coming generations debris, desolation and filth. This pungency is what really distinguishes Laudato Si from prior papal documents. Francis predecessors attempted versions of his double pitch urging Roman Catholics to recognize environmental devastation as a manifestation of the individualism the church has long condemned, while inviting secular readers to consider religious alternatives to our present way of life. But its urgency, sweep, and apocalyptic flavor may make Laudato Si more immediately influential, more likely to make both audiences think anew. However, its catastrophism also leaves this pope more open to empirical criticism. For instance, he doesnt grapple sufficiently with evidence that the global poor have become steadily less poor under precisely the world system he decries a reality that has complicated implications for environmentalism. Nor are questions related to population growth successfully resolved. If resource constraints are really as severe as the pope implies, and technological solutions as limited in power, it isnt entirely clear how the planet can sustain the steadily growing population the Catholic vision of marriage and fecundity implies. To credibly make the case that a billions-strong human race can keep having large families, you might need a more, well, dynamist view of the human future than this encyclical contains. Finally, its possible to believe that climate change is happening while doubting that it makes the present world system ... certainly unsustainable, as the pope suggests. Perhaps well face a series of chronic but manageable problems instead; perhaps radical change can, in fact, be persistently postponed. Indeed, perhaps our immediate future fits neither the dynamist nor the catastrophist framework. We might have entered a kind of stagnationist position, a sustainable decadence, in which the issues Pope Francis identifies percolate without reaching a world-altering boil. In that case, the deep critique our civilization deserves will have to be advanced without the threat of imminent destruction. The arguments in Laudato Si will still resonate, but they will have to be structured around a different peril: Not a fear that the particular evils of our age cant last, but the fear that actually, they can.(Ross Douthat writes for the New York Times. His syndicated column appears on Tuesdays.)

It's easy to sit in North Dakota and have the conservative murmur drown out much of the national and international debate on issues. This is, after all, a conservative place. But there's a danger, and that's the risk that our local civil discourse will become one sided. That ideas and positions here will not be challenged and made stronger. There's a danger that we will begin to believe that what we say or think is the truth.
\
Sometime it is the truth. And then, sometimes it is not.
\
I have a friend who I'd have to describe as liberal. She listens to Rush Limbaugh because she can't disagree with him without knowing what he says. She courts opposing opinions to understand the full range of our national political argument. It would be, for her, much less painful to listen to people she agreed with. But having actually listened to Limbaugh gives her opposition to him a certain integrity, and you have to respect that.
\
In North Dakota, the U.N. climate conference is generally viewed as a liberal conspiracy leading toward the establishment of a world government and the destruction of the U.S. economy and capitalism. Much of the local protest about climate change focuses on whether global warming exists, and opposes public policy controlling emission of greenhouse gases and the carbon deficit of ethanol. You might think that was the view of most of the protesters in Copenhagen. Not.
\
We are not on the same page, or even reading the same book.
\
The protesters at the U.N. climate conference were riled about the unpaid carbon debt wealthy nations owe the developing world. It was about how the United States, wanting to reduce greenhouse emissions by only 17 percent, was being criminal. About how small island nations on the globe will disappear as oceans rise and they are flooded out of existence, all because of the enormous American appetite for carbon. They are angry. They view global climate change through the lens of class warfare - the haves and the have-nots.
\
We think of climate change in North Dakota in terms of potential lost jobs and a diminished economy. Others in this country are worried about melting icecaps, coastal flooding, an increasingly acid ocean and generalized ecological disaster. Many North Dakotans believe global warming to be imagined, the failed result of quackish science.
\
Each side looks at the other and says, ""They don't get it."" We are worlds apart.
\
Yet cap-and-trade has been moving closer and closer to reality - closer to the coal-fired power plant stacks in North Dakota. It inches forward because of the force of public opinion in American urban centers based on a certain understanding of the science of climate change. It doesn't move forward based on economics and jobs. It's about rising ocean levels and drought, plants and animals being forced into new climatic zones, and it's about undeveloped nations wanting reparations for capitalism's consumption of carbon-based resources.
\
Some of it's true, and some of it likely isn't.
\
But public opinion is, for Congress, reality.
\
It's hard to have civil discourse, meaningful debate, when you do not believe in the basic premise in play. And we do not believe in each other's basic premise.
\
North Dakota will get cap-and-trade, and we'll get it, in part, because we ignored the debate. We talked to ourselves about how we have clean air, good reclamation laws and the benefits of clean coal technology. We've allowed ourselves to believe that global warming is a myth, rather, than acknowledge at least its possibility. We've taken up isolationist thinking about the environment and climate change. We've been concerned about coal-fired power plants here and wind farms here, and not coastal flooding and spreading drought elsewhere. We focus on jobs here and life here, to the exclusion of much of the world.
\
We've taken ourselves out of the national and international debate on climate change, and now we are likely going to face the consequences. The governor and congressional delegation will fight a rear-guard action on EPA's CO2 emission standards and cap-and-trade. But the federal government's response to climate change, the way it's shaping up, will happen to us.
\
It could have been different. And who's to blame? We all are.
\
Why? Because we look inward, rather than outward.

N.D. is an energy leader
\
Recently, there has been an onslaught of personal attack letters against members of the Public Service Commission and others about the ongoing cap-and-trade issue.
\
The reason for all these vicious letters is very easy to understand. The Obama administration, radical environmental groups and anti-growth activists have lost the argument when it comes to cap-and-trade legislation.
\
But the American people understand that destroying the fossil fuel industry is no way to make us energy independent or clean up the environment.
\
This has nothing to do with climate change, as the American people know. It is about political power and the Obama administration's radical agenda to achieve that power, and the Democrats in Congress are backing him up all the way.
\
They attack responsible experts in the field to try to revive a dead bill.
\
The American people want real solutions.
\
They want an energy policy that encourages the use of our own resources, whether fossil fuels, ethanol, biofuels, wind or other renewable energy sources.
\
In other words, they want the North Dakota energy program.
\
The North Dakota energy way is the way of the future. All the yelling, screaming, name-calling and personal attacks the Democrats are doing cannot change that.
\
That is what really upsets the attackers. They know that neither North Dakotans, nor the rest of Americans, buy their nonsense.
\
More taxation, more government control and more bureaucracy are not the answer.
\
Since cap-and-trade is on the Democrat-Obama agenda, the best way to stop it is to start right here in North Dakota. When we elect John Hoeven to the U.S. Senate and Rick Berg to the U.S. House, they will vote to put a stop to this plan of high government taxation on our energy resources.

WASHINGTON - Democratic leaders in Congress who confidently pledged far-reaching action this year on energy independence and climate change repeat the phrase ""new direction"" like a mantra.
\
But so far, the record of this Congress could be summarized by a text-message acronym: BAU, ""business as usual.""
\
The next few weeks will test whether Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other leaders can deliver a new energy bill that raises fuel- efficiency standards for cars, requires utilities to generate more electricity from renewable sources and mandates greater efficiency in buildings and appliances.
\
Pelosi also wants to shift more tax credits and incentives to solar, wind and other alternative sources.
\
Advocates have been frustrated by the slow pace of progress on global warming. They hope that this week a bipartisan bill from Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and Joe Lieberman, Connecticut independent, will jump-start an effort to set a cap on carbon emissions and allow producers to trade emissions credits.
\
But the ambitious timetable outlined by Democrats at the start of the year - an energy bill to President Bush by early fall, real progress on climate change legislation by the end of the year - is falling short. Al Gore, Nobel Peace Prize in hand, can step up his call for action, but Congress moves at its own speed.
\
That has left some advocates discouraged, and scaling back their goals for this year.
\
""The energy bill is about the only hope in this Congress to have some impact on global warming, and it's not a sure thing,"" said Frank O'Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch. ""It's really been disappointing that legislative action has been so slow.""
\
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who has worked for years to enact higher fuel efficiency standards, said she wasn't sure Congress has the will to do it this year. ""The mood in Washington is not a good one,"" she told a business group in San Francisco last week.
\
Because of procedural and partisan issues, Congress has moved slowly to reconcile two very different bills passed this summer by the House and Senate. The Senate bill includes the first increase in fuel efficiency standards in more than 20 years - to an average of 35 mpg in cars and light trucks by 2020. But some House Democrats, under pressure from automakers and unions, won't support that.
\
The House bill, which left out auto fuel efficiency, included a requirement that utilities generate 15 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2020. That's well below the goal of 25 percent set early in the year by the Center for American Progress, a think tank working closely with congressional Democrats.
\
About half of the states have already established ""renewable portfolio standards"" designed to wean utilities from coal and oil. California's target of 20 percent by 2010 is among the most ambitious.
\
Even so, the 15 percent requirement may not survive in a final bill because many senators, especially from the South, object. Southern utilities rely heavily on coal and argue they can't easily shift to solar, wind or bio-mass.
\
Both bills also phase out some tax breaks for oil and gas drilling and extend or create incentives for the use of renewable sources of energy.
\
But even the incentives for renewables are not a given. Charles Gay, vice president of San Jose-based Applied Materials, which manufactures solar technology, said he was working hard in Washington last week, trying to persuade members about the need for an extension of an investment tax credit for solar use.
\
Pelosi has remained upbeat about the prospects for a far- reaching energy bill.
\
""The New Direction Congress is completing work on a landmark energy bill that is our first step toward addressing global climate change,"" Pelosi said last week in a statement. ""Soon after, the House will consider cap-and-trade legislation that will greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.""
\
Resistance to an ambitious energy bill and any cap-and-trade plan comes from some unions and industries, and reveals divisions among Democrats. ""There's a rift between manufacturing Democrats and those from suburban areas who are environmentalists,"" said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton political scientist and author of several books on Congress.
\
""It's hard to resolve that basic tension within the party,"" Zelizer said. ""Any cap and trade system involves a huge regulatory challenge.""
\
The problem in the Senate is ""sewing together 60 votes for a package of efficiency, renewables and tax changes, and that's not easy,"" said Dan Weiss, an energy expert who has closely tracked the bills for the Center for American Progress.
\
Another ""business as usual"" factor is the impact of political contributions from utilities and manufacturers. The nation's 10 largest utilities have donated more than $400,000 this year to a majority of members on the House and Senate committees that handle energy legislation.
\
(EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
\
""These aren't like contributions to the March of Dimes. These companies want a seat at the table as the deals get cut,"" concluded an analysis of contributions by Clean Air Watch.
\
(END OPTIONAL TRIM)
\
Industries say their economic future is at risk in any system that tries to reduce emissions, citing economists' predictions that caps would mean higher fuel and power costs.
\
But a growing number of corporate leaders support mandatory limits on carbon emissions. A U.S. Chamber of Commerce survey last month of 600 businesses found that while 60 percent worry about compliance costs, 56 percent of private companies said the government should do more to reduce global warming, and that included requiring greater use of renewable energy.
\
Sen. Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who chairs the Environment Committee, said she hopes the Warner-Lieberman bill will be the vehicle that strikes enough balance to attract broad support. ""If the votes are there,"" Boxer said she will try to move it out of committee and give it momentum for next year.
\
(EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE)
\
But the urgency and will in Congress to tackle big decisions on carbon reductions remains unproven.
\
The corporate survey that found ambivalence on the issue ""reflects the dilemma that Congress and America as a whole face,"" said Michael Steel, a San Francisco partner in the law firm that sponsored the survey.
\
""Most people would like to see greenhouse gas emissions reduced to help curb the effects of climate change,"" Steel said. ""But serious questions remain about how best to do it and pay for it.""

When U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar visits North Dakota on Saturday, he should get the message on lignite coal: If America wants to remain a world economic leader, it needs to continue to invest in clean coal research and make a reasoned, economically prudent shift to new technologies and lower emissions of greenhouse gases.
\
The tide, however, seems to be going the other direction, at least in popular opinion in urban areas on the nation's coasts and among environmental groups and their lobbyists.
\
North Dakota's coal-fired energy industry faces a challenge: the possibility of a federal cap and trade strategy as a way to limit CO2 emissions.
\
Secretary Salazar's visit comes on the heels of the North Dakota Public Service Commission's summit on the impact of cap and trade on the state's energy industry, during which red flags were raised by coal country's community officials and industry leaders.
\
On the surface, it's a science issue and a health issue. Global warming, it is claimed, could cook the planet. But at its core, it's about politics, and a ground swell of American public opinion calling for immediate action to reduce the nation's carbon footprint. Many pro-green people want a tax on carbon, more specifically coal, or cap and trade. They want it now. And they are increasingly convinced that there can be no such thing as clean coal.
\
Nor does it matter to them that coal-fired plants have made huge strides in reducing emission, and are now only slowed at the task by the need to develop new and practical technologies to further scrub what goes up the stacks. It makes no difference that wind, solar and nuclear energy are not ready to step into coal's harness to pull the nation's energy load. And it apparently does not matter that people will pay the price for this kind of shortsighted federal action when they pay heating and cooling bills, and when the price of goods and services goes up to cover energy costs for business and industry.
\
When it comes to coal and a healthy environment, given practical economic and scientific limitations, it cannot be one or the other. It must be, as always, in that gray area between. We need to take care of the planet. We need to have environmentally sound practices and be more energy efficient. Emissions must be slowed. New advances in clean coal technology will become more practical and cost effective. And we must produce enough energy to meet demand at a price people can afford.
\
The message to Secretary Salazar: America needs a national energy policy that provides balance between traditional and alternative sources of energy aimed at energy self-sufficiency. And any carbon tax or cap and trade strategy needs to not punish people and the industry, but provide incentives for cleaner energy production, whether it be wind, solar, nuclear, oil, gas or coal driven.
\
Timing is everything.
"
11,"
We now have a pretty good idea who will be on the ballot in November: Hillary Clinton, almost surely (after the South Carolina blowout, prediction markets give her a 96 percent probability of securing her partys nomination), and Donald Trump, with high likelihood (currently 80 percent probability on the markets.) But even if theres a stunning upset in whats left of the primaries, we already know very well what will be at stake namely, the fate of the planet.
\
Why do I say this?
\
Obviously, the partisan divide on environmental policy has been growing ever wider. Just eight years ago the GOP nominated John McCain, whose platform included a call for a cap and trade system that is, a system that restricts emissions, but allows pollution permits to be bought and sold to limit greenhouse gases. Since then, however, denial of climate science and opposition to anything that might avert catastrophe have become essential pillars of Republican identity. So the choice in 2016 is starker than ever before.
\
Yet that partisan divide would not, in itself, be enough to make this a truly crucial year. After all, electing a pro-environment president wouldnt make much difference if he or (much more likely) she werent in a position to steer us away from the precipice. And the truth is that given Republican retrogression and the GOPs near-lock on the House of Representatives, even a blowout Democratic victory this year probably wouldnt create a political environment in which anything like McCains 2008 proposal could pass Congress.
\
But heres the thing: The next president wont need to pass comprehensive legislation, or indeed any legislation, to take a big step toward saving the planet. Dramatic progress in energy technology has put us in a position where executive action action that relies on existing law can achieve great things. All we need is an executive willing to take that action, and a Supreme Court that wont stand in its way.
\
And this years election will determine whether those conditions hold.
\
Many people, including some who should know better, still seem oddly oblivious to the ongoing revolution in renewable energy. Recently Bill Gates declared, as he has a number of times over the past few years, that we need an energy miracle some kind of amazing technological breakthrough to contain climate change. But weve already had that miracle: The cost of electricity generated by wind and sun has dropped dramatically, while costs of storage, crucial to making renewables fully competitive with conventional energy, are plunging as we speak.
\
The result is that were only a few years from a world in which carbon-neutral sources of energy could replace much of our consumption of fossil fuels at quite modest cost. True, Republicans still robotically repeat that any attempt to limit emissions would destroy the economy. But at this point such assertions are absurd. As both a technical matter and an economic one, drastic reductions in emissions would, in fact, be quite easy to achieve. All it would take to push us across the line would be moderately pro-environment policies.
\
As a card-carrying economist, I am obliged to say that it would be best if these policies took the form of a comprehensive system like cap and trade or carbon taxes, which would provide incentives to reduce emissions all across the economy. But something like the Obama administrations Clean Power Plan, which would use flexible regulations imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency on major emitters, should be enough to get us a long way toward the goal.
\
And as I said, no new legislation would be needed, just a president willing to act and a Supreme Court that wont stand in that presidents way, sacrificing the planet in the name of conservative ideology. Whats more, the Paris agreement from last year means that if the U.S. moves forward on climate action, much of the world will follow our lead.
\
I dont know about you, but this situation makes me very nervous. As long as the prospect of effective action on climate seemed remote, sheer despair kept me, and Im sure many others, comfortably numb you knew nothing was going to happen, so you just soldiered on. Now, however, salvation is clearly within our grasp, but it remains all too possible that well manage to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. And this is by far the most important issue there is; it, er, trumps even such things as health care, financial reform and inequality.
\
So Im going to be hanging on by my fingernails all through this election. No doubt there will be plenty of entertainment along the way, given the freak show taking place on one side of the aisle. But I wont forget that the stakes this time around are deadly serious. And neither should you.

North Dakota's three-member Public Service Commission rides herd on the state's critical energy sector, be it oil, coal or wind. It holds sway over regulations from extraction and generation to transmission and billing.
\
Along the way, it has responsibility for grain elevators and rail cars. The PSC manages the details of everything from power plant siting to quiet-rail crossings.
\
Public Service Commission members are elected to six-year terms. Kevin Cramer, a Republican, was appointed to the PSC in 2003, and he was elected to a full term in 2004. Brad Crabtree is Cramer's Democratic challenger.
\
Cramer has brought a conservative view to the commission. He has not pushed to expand the role and the authority of the PSC in regulating industry.
\
On the other hand, he was a part of a PSC public forum raising questions about federal climate change legislation and cap- and-trade. Cramer is neutral about having the PSC take a larger role in wind power.
\
Because of PSC action, home utility users will help pay the development costs of the failed Big Stone II coal-fired power plant.
\
This sharing of costs acknowledges the development partnership between public utilities and the families using electricity.
\
It was made possible by legislative action and conformed to the law. Cramer's role in the regulatory action was forthright and above board.
\
Crabtree has liberal credentials - sustainable energy, renewable energy. He's been involved in the state's civic discussion about wind and coal - developing high-profile public forums on ""sustainable"" energy.
\
He feels the Big Stone II debt payoff favors power plants and utilities over homeowners.
\
Both are smart guys - one conservative and one liberal.
\
Cramer has been a good PSC member. He has worked well with fellow Commissioners Tony Clark and Brian Kalk. He has balanced the needs of consumers with industry. He has walked the line as advocate and regulator of the lignite coal industry. He has brought a strong economic development background to the PSC while maintaining a clear concern for the environment of North Dakota.
\
Kevin Cramer has been a public service commissioner for seven years. He has gone about the job responsibly and professionally, and as a result North Dakota has benefited.
\
The Tribune endorses Kevin Cramer for public service commissioner on the Nov. 2 General Election ballot.

Emissions policy struck downWASHINGTON (AP) - A federal appeals court struck down the Bush administration approach to limiting mercury emissions by power plants Friday, ruling that the government failed to adequately consider the policy's effect on public health and the environment.
\
More than a dozen states sued to block the regulation, saying it would allow dangerous levels of mercury into the environment. The toxic metal is known to contaminate seafood that can damage the developing brains of fetuses and young children.
\
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit threw out a rule known as cap-and-trade. That policy allows power plants that fail to meet emission targets to buy credits from plants that did, rather than having to install their own mercury emissions controls. The rule was to go into effect in 2010.
\
""This three-judge panel has done the world a favor and helped save lives,"" said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, one of many attorneys general who joined a lawsuit originally brought by New Jersey.
\
The three-judge court unanimously struck down the cap-and-trade policy and the Environmental Protection Agency's plan to exempt coal- and oil-fired power plants from regulations requiring strict emissions control technology to block emissions.Teacher was trying to divorce husbandPORTSMOUTH, Ohio (AP) - His schoolteacher wife had left him and filed for divorce. A young woman he was seeing may have had second thoughts about her relationship with an older man.
\
William Michael Layne stabbed them both - his estranged wife in front of her fifth-grade class in Portsmouth and the other woman in an alley behind her home. Then he put a shotgun in his mouth and ended it, police said.
\
Christi Layne, 53, was in critical but stable condition Friday after surgery at Cabell Hospital in Huntington, W.Va., Portsmouth Police Chief Charles Horner said. Stephanie Loop, 22, was in the same condition at Grant Medical Center in Columbus, the chief said.
\
Christi Layne's students at Notre Dame Elementary School saw her husband barge into the classroom and stab her Thursday morning. Layne fled, attacking Loop a few blocks from the school.
\
Police tracked him to his home near the Ohio River, surrounded it and finally found the 56-year-old dead after a standoff.

Pope Francis is one of the worlds most inspiring figures. There are passages in his new encyclical on the environment that beautifully place human beings within the seamless garment of life. And yet overall the encyclical is surprisingly disappointing. Legitimate warnings about the perils of global warming morph into 1970s-style doom-mongering about technological civilization. There are too many overdrawn statements like The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth. Hardest to accept, though, is the moral premise implied throughout the encyclical: that the only legitimate human relationships are based on compassion, harmony and love, and that arrangements based on self-interest and competition are inherently destructive. The pope has a section on work in the encyclical. The sections heroes are St. Francis of Assisi and monks emblems of selfless love who seek to return, the pope says, to a state of original innocence. He is relentlessly negative, on the other hand, when describing institutions in which people compete for political power or economic gain. At one point he links self-interest with violence. He comes out against technological advances that will improve productivity by replacing human work. He specifically condemns market-based mechanisms to solve environmental problems, even though these cap-and-trade programs are up and running in places like California. Moral realists, including Catholic ones, should be able to worship and emulate a God of perfect love and still appreciate systems, like democracy and capitalism, that harness self-interest. But Francis doesnt seem to have practical strategies for a fallen world. He neglects the obvious truth that the qualities that do harm can often, when carefully directed, do enormous good. Within marriage, lust can lead to childbearing. Within a regulated market, greed can lead to entrepreneurship and economic innovation. Within a constitution, the desire for fame can lead to political greatness. You would never know from the encyclical that we are living through the greatest reduction in poverty in human history. A raw and rugged capitalism in Asia has led, ironically, to a great expansion of the middle class and great gains in human dignity. You would never know that in many parts of the world, like the United States, the rivers and skies are getting cleaner. The race for riches, ironically, produces the wealth that can be used to clean the environment. A few years ago, a team of researchers led by Daniel Esty of Yale looked at the environmental health of 150 countries. The nations with higher income per capita had better environmental ratings. As countries get richer they invest to tackle environmental problems that directly kill human beings (though they dont necessarily tackle problems that despoil the natural commons). You would never suspect, from this encyclical, that over the last decade, one of the most castigated industries has, ironically, produced some of the most important economic and environmental gains. Im talking of course about fracking. There was recently a vogue for polemical antifracking documentaries like Gasland that purport to show that fracking is causing flammable tap water and other horrors. But a recent Environmental Protection Agency study found that there was no evidence that fracking was causing widespread harm to the nations water supply. On the contrary, theres some evidence that fracking is a net environmental plus. Thats because cheap natural gas from fracking displaces coal. A study by the Breakthrough Institute found coal-powered electricity declined to 37 percent from 50 percent of the generation mix between 2007 and 2012. Because natural gas has just half as much global-warming potential as coal, energy-related carbon emissions have declined more in the U.S. than in any other country over that time. Fracking has also been an enormous boon to the nations wealth and the well-being of its people. In a new report called Americas Unconventional Energy Opportunity, Michael E. Porter, David S. Gee and Gregory J. Pope conclude that gas and oil resources extracted through fracking have already added more than $430 billion to annual gross domestic product and supported more than 2.7 million jobs that pay, on average, twice the median U.S. salary. Pope Francis is a wonderful example of how to be a truly good person. But if we had followed his line of analysis, neither the Asian economic miracle nor the technology-based American energy revolution would have happened. Thered be no awareness that though industrialization can lead to catastrophic pollution in the short term (China), over the long haul both people and nature are better off with technological progress, growth and regulated affluence. The innocence of the dove has to be accompanied by the wisdom of the serpent the awareness that programs based on the purity of the heart backfire; the irony that the best social programs harvest the low but steady motivations of people as they actually are.(David Brooks writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.)

Behind the present explosion of oil development in the Williston Basin you will find technology. We are able to squeeze crude oil from deep in the Bakken formation using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Without these industry advances, North Dakota holes would be coming up dry.
\
In hydraulic fracturing, pressure is used to force water, chemicals and other materials into deep wells, releasing crude oil from the shale.
\
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has instigated a study of hydraulic fracturing's effects on water supplies. And Congress has bills in both chambers calling for federal regulation of fracturing. The bills are on hold, likely until the study has been completed.
\
North Dakota has a lot at stake in the outcome of the study. The state has its aquifer and groundwater resources at risk. And the state's energy resources, along with their economic spinoff, hangs in the balance.
\
It's imperative that the EPA study be transparent and credible.
\
Although fracturing may be a relatively new technique in North Dakota's oil patch, it has been used in the petroleum industry for more than half a century. Oil companies say they are confident that the study will find hydraulic fracturing safe in terms of water resources. On the other hand, environmental groups have raised the question of safety and are using that to drive federal regulation of fracturing.
\
Presently, states have the authority to regulate techniques and technologies in their oil fields. Given the federal government's lack of flexibility and preference for one-size-fits-all solutions, the states are in a position to do a better job of protecting the local environment. And the EPA has a successful history of using state health departments as vehicles for executing environmental law.
\
Why not leave the responsibility with those with the most at stake?
\
The Obama administration has indicated it's ready to begin work on a national energy policy. It's time.
\
It's also unsettling how many issues affecting North Dakota and its developing energy industry will be a part of this national debate hydraulic fracturing, cap-and-trade, emissions of greenhouse gases, ethanol blend percentages.
\
North Dakota needs to be engaged on local and national levels on a host of energy issues. It's in the state's best interest to have clear and reasonable policies based on hard science and sensible economics.
\
We must have the information necessary to understand the consequences of potential policy, and the will to act on well-conceived and common-sense solutions.

Gov. John Hoeven told lawmakers Tuesday on Capitol Hill that Congress should scrap the so-called ""cap-and-trade"" energy policy for one that would equally bolster traditional and renewable fuel sources.
\
U.S. senators heard from four governors, including Hoeven, three mayors and an Arkansas state representative about the potential impact of energy and climate change legislation before Congress.
\
Hoeven, the only Republican to address the Senate Standing Committee on Environment and Public Works, told lawmakers the cap-and-trade policy that recently passed the U.S. House would have dire financial consequences on North Dakota's lignite coal-reliant consumers.
\
The cap-and-trade policy would set limitations on carbon dioxide emissions and establish a market for certain emitters to sell or buy carbon dioxide allowances.
\
Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., a leading opponent to the cap-and-trade provision in the House energy bill, invited Hoeven to address the Senate committee.
\
""In North Dakota our approach is about developing all of our energy resources, both traditional and renewable,"" Hoeven said.
\
Hoeven said North Dakota power companies are implementing ""clean coal"" technologies, such as a Dakota Gasification Company plant in Beulah that converts lignite coal into a liquid synthetic natural gas.
\
A national cap-and-trade policy could put an end to those advancements in technology because they would be too costly, he said.
\
""Each and every source of energy has some drawbacks, traditional and renewable,"" Hoeven said. ""We have to be careful in energy policy about picking winners and losers, and instead incentivize states, this country, to develop all of our energy resources and do so in environmentally sound ways.""
\
Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., noted some Democratic opposition to the cap-and-trade policy, citing an op-ed against the policy written by North Dakota Sen. Byron Dorgan that ran in The Bismarck Tribune on Sunday. Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer also told HBO's Bill Maher in a Friday interview that he does not support the policy.
\
Democratic lawmakers had many questions for Hoeven, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who asked Hoeven if he agrees with scientists who have concluded that the consequences of global warming could be dire for future generations.
\
Hoeven said there is evidence of global warming, but said there are still more questions about the cause of the phenomenon and went on to advocate for a comprehensive federal policy. Sanders stopped him mid-sentence.
\
""Actually, that wasn't my question, my question was a pretty simple one,"" Sanders said. ""Some of the leading scientists in the world tell us that global warming is a huge crisis for this world. Now it will only get worse. Do you agree with that assessment?""
\
""I agree we need to address it,"" Hoeven said. ""I think there are different opinions as to what causes it.""
\
In her opening statements, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., noted efforts in North Dakota to invest in renewable energy sources, such as wind turbines.
\
""We will be engaging in this century's version of the space race, it will be the energy race,"" Klobuchar said. ""This time the finish line will be wind turbine manufacturing in North Dakota.""
\
She also noted the Senate is likely to change the energy policy approved by the House in June while insisting Congress approve a policy this year to ensure the United States remains competitive in the growing global renewable energy market.
\
""I agree we need to make some changes for the middle class and a more aggressive renewable energy standard, but I agree we cannot sit on our hands and do nothing because other countries will fill that void,"" Klobuchar said.
\
The Democratic governors from Washington, Colorado and New Jersey also testified before the committee.
\
Gov. Bill Ritter of Colorado said he wants a national energy and climate change policy, but not explicitly the legislation that recently passed the U.S. House, which Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., voted against.
\
Klobuchar also asked Hoeven about his stance on increasing the amount of ethanol fuel blended with gasoline, a question currently being mulled by the Environmental Protection Agency.
\
""You should do it,"" Hoeven said.
\
""Thank you for that North Dakota directness,"" Klobuchar said.

\
The Public Service Commission approved a settlement Friday that allows Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. and Otter Tail to pass the costs of a failed plant onto consumers.
\
At a staff meeting earlier this week, North Dakota's three public service commissioners blamed the failure of the Big Stone II plant on the uncertainty of the regulatory environment because of cap-and-trade legislation. They authorized the two electric companies to pass the $13.7 million of the development costs onto consumers.
\
That move has Democratic PSC candidate Brad Crabtree crying foul, saying the PSC is politicizing an issue when they should not have given the companies an advance determination of prudence for a plant using old technology.
\
The PSC issues an advance determination of prudence if they believe a company has shown the project is necessary for supplying energy. Doing so obligates them to award the company the right to recover invested money if the project fails.
\
""Blaming failure for this project on federal legislation that never passed Congress intentionally misrepresents the facts of the case and politicizes the critical nonpartisan role of the Public Service Commission to a degree that is both disturbing and unprecedented,"" Crabtree said in a statement. ""North Dakota ratepayers are now left with a bill because Kevin Cramer and his colleagues backed a project that was economically uncertain and featured yesterday's coal technology, not today's.""
\
As part of the settlement agreement, the commissioners asked for MDU to periodically run an insert in its billings to explain that failure for the project lies with uncertainties caused by cap-and-trade. The PSC has editorial control over the insert, which will first appear along with the August bills.
\
Crabtree said the commissioners are trying to divert attention away from a poorly-made decision on their part. He said the economic uncertainty of the project was obvious when they awarded the advanced determination of prudence in 2008 because another partner in the project, Great River Energy, had dropped out about a year earlier, citing reduced energy demand and greater interest in pursuing renewable energy projects.
\
Crabtree said blaming the Obama administration is a flawed argument. The 2008 election hadn't been decided when they gave the OK to MDU and Otter Tail to proceed with the project, although Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., had introduced a cap-and-trade bill previously and a climate change bill was expected in the near future, Crabtree said.
\
""All the uncertainty and all the risk for this project were obvious and documented when they made their decision in the summer of 2008,"" Crabtree said.
\
Commission Chairman Cramer, Crabtree's Republican opponent in the race, said Crabtree's statements show the difference between being a commissioner and wanting to be one. Cramer said he still believes cap-and-trade is the main culprit in the failure of Big Stone II and that all the other financial problems were tied to a ""paralyzed Congress"" that was unable to pass a climate bill.
\
Cramer said he still believes the project was prudent, given the fact that they are not allowed to consider unquantifiable environmental externalities when determining prudence - an issue now before the state Supreme Court. Cramer said those externalities could be environmental legislation or decisions made about utilities in neighboring states. They can't be considered because ""they are not hard costs,"" Cramer said.
\
""In this case, there was testimony by interveners that it (the Big Stone II project) shouldn't be prudent because there were going to be environmental costs in the future,"" Cramer said. ""But we were barred from considering any future environmental costs in our decision. We can't even use that testimony.""
\
Crabtree said that contrary to the commissioner's assertions about federal policy, other utilities proposing more advanced coal generation technologies during the same time period have managed to proceed to construction, including more advanced, efficient and lower emission power plants in Arkansas and Indiana.
\
""This is not about federal climate policy, this is about whether the commission made a responsible decision for ratepayers. Their primary responsibility is to make sure consumers are protected,"" Crabtree said. ""Their decisions aren't supposed to adversely affect consumers, but their decision did.""
\
Cramer said he is working to tweak the law of advanced determination of prudence. He said he doesn't disagree with the concept, but it bothers him that companies get a return on their investment before plant construction has even begun - just like Big Stone II.
\
""The company gets to count the money they invested on lawyers and engineering and publicity as part of the costs, and then they get a 9 percent return on that,"" Cramer said.
\
He said he would prefer the return come at a much lower rate.
\
The PSC's decision will allow a rate increase for three years or until the company recovers the funds. For the average MDU customer, bills will rise by $1.49 a month, while Otter Tail customers may see a 62-cent increase starting this August.

Elections have consequences. That's why I'm voting for Randy Christmann for the Public Service Commission.
\
On the national scene, the debate over cap-and-trade died after the November 2010 election when Republicans took back control of the House. However, I don't believe the issue has died with Brad Crabtree, the Democrat's candidate for the PSC.
\
In a February 2010 Tribune article, Crabtree said he supports cap-and-trade. He went on to say, ""It's my professional work. It's my life's work and just because I'm running for office, I'm not going to change that.""
\
If cap-and-trade were to pass, North Dakota's lignite industry would be devastated. Our state would have about $15 billion in stranded assets, along with thousands of unemployed miners and power plant workers.
\
In the November election, I support Republican Randy Christmann. He understands and supports the lignite industry. He has served for many years, both in the Legislature as a state senator and as vice chairman of Lignite Research Council.
\
The choice couldn't be any clearer. Christmann supports North Dakotans and good jobs. His opponent does not.

\
N.D. needs the rN.D. needs the right senator
\
The most important vote in North Dakota is for the U.S. Senate seat.
\
Twenty-six years ago, North Dakota sent a young man to Washington who said he was going to get the federal budget under control by 1992, or he would turn the job over to someone else. Now we have four years of trillion dollar deficits, and as chairman of the Democratically-controlled Senate Budget Committee, he has not proposed a 2013 budget.
\
Heidi Heitkamp correctly says we need to operate with a budget. She supports a balanced budget amendment.
\
Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad had the opportunity to cast decisive votes to pass a balanced budget amendment.
\
Conrad, like Heitkamp, said he supported such an amendment if it excluded Social Security and Medicare.
\
Social Security and Medicare did, from 1983 through 2009, generate more revenue than disbursements. Congress spent this income on operating expenses while at the same time counting it as investments in the trust fund.
\
From 2010, revenues for Social Security and Medicare have been insufficient to pay current benefits. The non-existing trust funds will move from debt held by the government to debt held by the public.
\
Voters under age 45 should recognize that Medicare will not be there for them; voters under 53 should recognize that Social Security will not be there unless funding and benefit schedules are modified.
\
The quicker the problems are addressed, the less severe will be the medicine. Around 2030, when the phantom trust fund expires, revenues will allow Social Security benefits of only 75 percent of the scheduled benefits.
\
We need a U.S. senator who will vote the way he talks in North Dakota, not another senator who talks fiscal responsibility inNorth Dakota and then, as chairman of the Budget Committee, doesn't even prepare a budget.
\
Sick of all the negative ads? I know I am. It is hard to believe that Heidi Heitkamp is as dopey and conniving as they are making her out and also hard to believe that Rick Berg is as evil and greedy as he is portrayed. My guess is if you went out to eat with them you would find they are both really good people who sincerely care about North Dakota.
\
I grew up in Minot and Cooperstown, attended both North Dakota State University and the University of North Dakota so I have a pretty good flavor for our state. I would be considered a North Dakota conservative, however, that has not always dictated how I vote. I have cast ballots in the past for Kent Conrad, Byron Dorgan and Earl Pomeroy. At the time I felt they were the better candidates and what we needed in Washington.
\
Currently, we have record commodity prices, all time high land values and Bakken oil money coming in, that if properly managed, should secure a great future for our state for generations to come.
\
The risks to our state don't come from within our borders but from the east, from Washington. It is impossible to sustain the deficit spending. There is no magic bullet for this issue.
\
From what I can gather from the criticism, Berg's biggest fault is that he was successful. I think Heitkamp's very nice, but now is not her time.
\
Our country is in a financial mess right now. It makes no sense to take away North Dakota's contribution toward correcting this mess by canceling out Sen. John Hoeven's vote in the Senate. I would expect Heitkamp and Hoeven would vote the same on farm issues but regarding the rest of the big issues, she would nullify his vote which will hurt not only our state but the country. I would encourage the people sitting on the fence to vote for Rick Berg.
\
President Barack Obama has stated the U.S. is not just a Christian nation. With this I disagree. This country was founded on Christian principles and was intended to remain a Christian nation.
\
The U.S. Supreme Court has the Ten Commandments posted above the place where the justices are seated. Around the Capitol mall, you can read a lot of Bible verses etched in stone all over the federal buildings and monuments in Washington.
\
There is an inscription at The Daughters of the American Revolution building saying, ""Let us raise a standard to which the wise and honest can repair the event. The event is in the hands of God."" In the Department of Interior is a time capsule with a Bible.
\
At the Korean Veterans Memorial, there is a cross and the Star of David, There is a ""Liberty of Worship"" statue resting on the Ten Commandments outside the Ronald Reagan Building. You will find references to God at the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, the National Archives, Senate and House office buildings, the U.S. Supreme Court, the Jefferson Memorial. Each session of Congress starts with a prayer by a preacher.
\
When you go to vote please keep this information in mind as you select our future leaders. We need more than good leaders. We need God's blessing and his help.
\
I just saw the final debate between Heidi Heitkamp and Rick Berg. Once again Berg trotted out the Republican bogeyman known as Obamacare.
\
Berg and his party want to repeal this, but they have nothing to replace it with. Without it, hundreds of thousands of American families will be forced into bankruptcy when they suffer a health care-related event.
\
Also, Berg and his campaign continue to bring up the biggest lie about Obamacare: that it cuts $716 billion to Medicare. It does not, and this has been proven time and time again.
\
However, Berg himself voted for a $714 billion cut to Medicare to finance a tax cut for the richest among us.
\
And contrary to Berg's claims, our deficit won't get better, it will get worse. This health care law will save the government $1 trillion over the next 20 years. Take it away and we can tack on another trillion to our debt.
\
Republicans used to agree that we have a health care crisis in this country. That's why they wrote this bill almost 20 years ago.
\
They know it is what this country needs. But they demonize it because it is not what their political party needs.
\
Don't let Rick Berg fool you with his scare tactics. Elect Heidi Heitkamp so we can fix the parts of the bill that need fixing and prevent neighbors and friends from losing everything they have.
\
As an entrepreneur, I've spent the last 30 years working to build globally competitive companies right here in North Dakota. The future of our state depends on our youth and their ability to compete in a global environment, which is directly tied to the quality of education they receive.
\
That is why I am voting for Kirsten Baesler for North Dakota's superintendent of public instruction on Nov. 6.
\
It is a very important race for North Dakota taxpayers. The state's budget for public instruction is more than $1.5 billion each biennium, so the next DPI superintendent needs to demonstrate a deep understanding of North Dakota's educational system and its financial demands.
\
We are very fortunate to have one candidate who is so qualified and is such a passionate believer in our youth and their education. Kirsten's background has prepared her well. She comes from the small community of Flasher, so she is well acquainted with the issues facing our small, rural Class B schools.
\
At the same time, she thoroughly understands how large school districts operate. Kirsten has spent 20 years as an educator and administrator in Bismarck Public Schools. She also serves as an elected official as president of the Mandan School Board. The Mandan School District is large "" consisting of 3,800 children. Kirsten has viewed education from every vantage point, as a parent, a school board member and an educator.
\
Kirsten is the only person in this year's race to receive an endorsement from the North Dakota Education Association.
\
She is the right choice for the students in North Dakota, the right choice for the future of education and the right choice for our state.
\
Please join me in getting the word out that Kirsten is our clear choice to become North Dakota superintendent of public instruction.
\
As a small business owner in central North Dakota, I believe we need to elect someone to the U.S. Senate who will stand up for small businesses and be an advocate for America's small business owners.
\
Rick Berg is the right person for the job. I own a small business and I was recently named Small Business Person of the Year for the Bismarck-Mandan area. This is an incredible honor, and I am humbled to have received this award.
\
Owning and managing a business today means facing an ever-more burdensome governmental regulations and a national economic future that is getting worse day by day. We need Berg in Washington.
\
Berg was recently named a ""guardian of small business"" by the National Federation of Independent Businesses. He has advocated on behalf of America's small business owners and has a proven record of standing strong on key legislation that could affect small businesses.
\
He understands that all too often, our country's small businesses are hurt by over-regulation and uncertainty.
\
Elect Berg to the U.S. Senate because he understands how difficult it can be to excel in today's economy. I trust him to stand up for America.
\
Berg's opponent seems to be promising everything to everyone. Heidi Heitkamp's ""tax and spend"" is the same old story we have all heard before. The big difference is that Berg understands that America is $16 trillion in debt.
\
Ask Berg why he wants to be a senator. He will tell you spending is out of control (America is borrowing $325 billion per day to make up the shortfall).
\
For him, it would be much easier to promise continued, out of control spending as Heitkamp is advocating.
\
Kevin Cramer has run a class act campaign. He has displayed the kind of leadership and maturity we could use a lot more of in Washington.
\
I appreciate his commitment to running only positive advertising, putting out well-done TV commercials that communicate his plans for the future.
\
Cramer has remained focused on his message of cutting the debt, balancing the budget and repealing over-regulation.
\
Cramer's Democrat opponents, even some who are running for different offices, have tried throwing a long list of complaints and accusations at him, but none of them stuck.
\
Why? Because voters know Cramer is a man of principled convictions and solid integrity. After decades in the public arena, Cramer has stood the test of time, performing admirably in his various roles and proving his true leadership abilities.
\
We need more public servants like Kevin Cramer representing Americans in Congress.
\
On Nov. 6, I will gladly cast my ballot for Cramer. I encourage you to do the same.
\
As a state senator, I had the privilege of working with Warren Larson on a number of issues impacting the state.
\
Larson was an outspoken advocate for education during his service as a school superintendent. He balanced budgets during difficult times and was a good steward of resources even when there were surpluses.
\
I was most impressed with Larson's leadership role in developing a new state educational funding formula. He was a de facto leader on the study committee, providing expertise in funding options as well as identifying the impact of proposals on students.
\
Without his steady work and ability to convince leaders across the state, North Dakota's education funding reforms would never have passed.
\
District 7 voters have a unique opportunity to elect a qualified capable leader as their legislator.
\
Larson's experience will help District 7 from Day One of the next legislative session and put him head and shoulders above other freshman legislators. He is a personable man with the ability to work across party lines to accomplish the right results.
\
District 7 will be in good hands with Warren Larson as its state representative.
\
Why would we vote for a superintendent of public instruction candidate who chose to leave the classroom more than 20 years ago with very little teaching experience?
\
Someone with a couple of years as a history teacher and several years running as a die-hard Democrat to become a professional politician is the wrong candidate for our children.
\
We have seen the negative effects of No Child Left Behind because we let career politicians decide what is best for our education system.
\
Kirsten Baesler has made education her life. From the moment she started college to the present she has made education her passion.
\
She was an elementary school teacher, a library media specialist, an assistant principal, a member of the Mandan School Board, and she has served as president of that board. She is an active member of the North Dakota School Board Association and editor of its member publication, ""Bulletin,"" as well as serving as the assistant to the executive director for the NDSBA.
\
We in the state of North Dakota have not seen a superintendent of public instruction's resume that equals that of Baesler. I have had several opportunities to discuss relevant issues in education with Baesler and found her to be able to listen to my concerns and then address them with relevant answers that come only from someone in education.
\
On Nov. 6, we have a choice to make. Should we pick someone who has a desire to make politics his livelihood with very little education experience, or do we make the right decision and choose the candidate who has made education her passion and teaching our children her life?
\
Let's vote for Kirsten Baesler and let our education system be run by educators.
\
As a former U.S. senator and wounded Vietnam veteran, I have endured my fair share of political and military fights. On the battlefield, a combat unit must work seamlessly together to complete a successful mission.
\
All your trust and faith is put in your fellow soldiers. Your life depends on it.
\
Partisanship and political ideology are nonexistent on the battlefield. Soldiers know they need the support of each other to help end the conflict and keep America's freedom intact.
\
Today's elected officials in Washington could really learn a thing or two about public service from our military.
\
Instead of working together, however, the staunch ideology of Washington is preventing critical programs from being implemented.
\
Washington needs leaders who will stand with the American people, put politics aside and fight for the future of our country's armed services. Heidi Heitkamp will do just that. She's been a strong advocate for North Dakota's military community, and will continue to fight on behalf of the Grand Forks and Minot air bases in the U.S. Senate.
\
I'm not the only decorated war veteran who believes in Heidi. Four-star Generals Wesley Clark and John Abrams are also backing Heidi's Senate campaign. We know Heidi is committed to ensuring America maintains a strong military presence, and that North Dakota's air bases continue to play an important role in protecting our nation.
\
I know that Heidi has what it takes to truly make a difference in Washington by breaking through the partisan divide and fighting for common sense solutions. Heidi will be North Dakota's soldier in the Senate. She will work with anyone, regardless of party affiliation, to do what is right for North Dakota and America. If you want a dedicated leader who will fight for North Dakota's soldiers and veterans, be sure to vote for Heidi on Nov. 6.

Energy industry experts and insiders will converge in the Bismarck Civic Center on June 29 and 30 to discuss renewable energy production, carbon capture technologies and policies governments are considering to help curb climate change.
\
The International Climate Stewardship Solutions Conference, which is open to the public, will feature 13 speakers, ranging from scientists who study climate change to leaders in the coal, fossil fuel and renewable energy industries, said Jason Schaefer, project manager for Prairie Climate Stewardship Network.
\
This is the second conference of its kind in Bismarck.
\
Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., and Gov. John Hoeven are expected to give speeches that will address climate change legislation and its impact on the environment and economy.
\
On June 29, Preston Chiaro, the CEO of the global mining company Rio Tinto, will deliver a keynote address on climate change legislation and how it could impact energy consumption around the globe.
\
In a phone interview with the Bismarck Tribune on Thursday, Chiaro said from his London office that the world is facing a growing problem: energy consumption is expected to double by 2050 if current trends continue.
\
""So we need to find additional sources of energy,"" he said. ""We can't afford to block off other alternatives.""
\
That means the global menu of energy options will diversify rather than shrink, which is likely to include coal, nuclear, fossil fuels and renewable energies, Chiaro said.
\
Congress' current version of cap-and-trade legislation, a policy that also will be addressed by the international community this December at a climate change summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, also could help spur market-based solutions to energy consumption and its impact on the environment, Chiaro said.
\
He said his company - a leading producer of coal as well as uranium, diamonds and other minerals - is making investments in carbon capture technologies, which stores carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants in underground cavities. He said the stored carbon has economic benefits, such as using it to extract oil.
\
""We're taking action not because of altruism, but for a very good business reason,"" Chiaro said. ""Because we want to protect one of our key commodities.""
\
He said cap-and-trade policies will work as long as they are market-based and environmentally effective. And while they should be globally enforced, Chiaro adds that, ""Someone has to go first.""
\
""The countries with the highest emissions should take the first steps, but that doesn't mean the developing countries should be let off the hook,"" he said. ""Eventually everybody's going to have to make a contribution.""
\
Chiaro also notes that progress in the coal industry, one of the world's cheapest and most abundant sources of energy, has come to something of a standstill while Congress mulls cap and trade legislation.
\
""Unless we get some resolution to that uncertainty ... I think the likelihood of more being built is minimal,"" he said. ""That pushes up against the demand for more energy, and that's going to set us up for a train wreck.""
\
He adds whatever policies emerge out of Washington should prepare energy producers for a new set of circumstances when the global economy begins to recover from the recession.
\
""We need to retool them for a new world, instead of yesterday's world,"" Chiaro said.

Gov. John Hoeven will join three governors and four local officials from around the country today on Capitol Hill to testify on the so-called cap-and-trade bill before the U.S. Senate.
\
Hoeven, who opposes the legislation, is the only Republican to testify before the committee today. As part of an effort to curb climate change, the bill would set limitations on carbon dioxide emissions and establish a market for certain emitters to sell or buy carbon dioxide allowances.
\
Hoeven said he opposes the bill because it would increase the cost of power in lignite coal-reliant North Dakota, adding that Congress should instead aim to develop ""a comprehensive energy policy that encourages the development of all types of energy.""
\
That includes oil, wind power, solar, coal and so on, Hoeven said.
\
In June, the state's all-Republican Public Service Commission estimated that the bill could double North Dakota power bills because of its carbon emission restrictions.
\
The Democratic governors from Washington, New Jersey and Colorado also will testify before the Senate Standing Committee on Environment and Public Works, chaired by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
\
Other public officials testifying include the mayors of Trenton, N.J., Burlington, Vt., and Arlington, Va., as well as an Arkansas state representative - all Democrats.
\
Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., the ranking Republican on the committee and a leading opponent to the cap-and-trade legislation, invited Hoeven to testify before the committee.
\
The governor received Inhofe's invitation on July 14, said Don Canton, Hoeven's spokesman.
\
The cap-and-trade legislation narrowly passed the U.S. House in June, with Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., voting against it.
\
North Dakota Democratic Sens. Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan also have said they are not supportive of the current version of the bill.
\
Dorgan penned an op-ed piece that ran in The Bismarck Tribune on Sunday against the current version, primarily arguing against the proposed carbon dioxide market and the potential for dangerous speculation to emerge.
\
""I support capping carbon emissions,"" Dorgan wrote. ""But it has to be done the right way, with targets and timelines that allow us to accomplish our goals without driving the cost of energy for homeowners and businesses out of sight.""
\
Speculation regarding a potential Senate race between Dorgan and Hoeven intensified this summer when the governor said he would make a decision about whether to enter the race by Labor Day.
\
The hearing begins at 9 a.m. CDT. For more information, visit www.epw.senate.gov.

North Dakota has climbed to 10th among the states for wind production. A project is being developed to refine a renewable jet fuel at the Tesoro Oil Refinery at Mandan. The first coal-fired power plant to begin operations in the state in 25 years expects to begin producing electricity yet this year. An 85-mile crude oil pipeline, through McKenzie, Dunn and Billings counties, has been proposed. These are the high-profile snippets of energy news from the past week.
\
Wind, oil, coal and biofuels.
\
Let's call it a diversified energy sector.
\
As North Dakota farmers help feed the nation, the state's energy producers will help America power up.
\
The world has two very serious demands after peace. They are: hunger and a growing need for energy. North Dakota has, step by step, moved into position to have a key role in the way the global future plays out. The state exports food and energy, and has the capacity to increase those exports.
\
North Dakota's growing energy production, in particular crude oil but also wind power, is balanced by the state's strong agricultural interests. Balanced in terms of taking care of the environment. And, taking care of people. It's an off-setting tension that makes the future seem less industrially difficult - no awful slag heaps here.
\
The approach to this point of energy diversity has been cautious, some might say slow, and that reflects the nature of many North Dakotans. And although the past week has had an interesting collection of energy news items, there's a drag on the whole energy industry in the state. It's a federal drag. The nation continues to operate without a national energy policy (with the uncertainty of proposed cap and trade resurfacing in President Obama's State of the Union address) and with additional uncertainty in the financial markets that will be needed to finance the growth.
\
Federal action on these issues cannot be described as being too cautious. They are, instead, victims of the polarized debate over health care reform. North Dakota needs Congress to work through these important concerns. The nation needs to have it happen.
\
Meanwhile, in North Dakota, plans are made, development projects are nurtured and wells are drilled. Transmission lines and pipelines to market are plotted across the prairie. The momentum for a strong, long-term state economy grows.

Climate change and renewable fuels are leading topics of discussion in local coffee shops, at Capitol Hill hearings and at international conferences. We can be grateful that North Dakota agriculture is well positioned to play an instrumental role in securing solutions to today's pressing challenges.
\
Right now, climate change is a dominant policy issue in Washington. Recently, the Environmental Protection Association announced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are a threat to public health. The U.S. Supreme Court gave EPA a directive to regulate GHG emissions. At the same time, Congress is considering a bill that would more clearly define the nation's climate change policies, including which federal departments will have responsibility to implement programs.
\
Our nation's climate change policy will affect everyone. Because of this, it is critical that federal policy be designed to work for the overall good of America. I have asked North Dakota's congressional delegation to ensure agricultural offsets are included in any climate change legislation moving through Congress. Certain farming practices have scientifically been proven to ""offset"" or capture carbon dioxide in the soil - in effect removing a greenhouse gas from the atmosphere.
\
If EPA alone is responsible for addressing GHGs, the agency may well create a regulatory scheme that would not factor in the agricultural carbon credit benefits available (and already in use), and instead employ policies that would only increase production costs. EPA, by its historic nature, is geared toward penalties and fines to obtain compliance.
\
North Dakota Farmers Union members have long been concerned with the effects of climate change to agriculture and recognize the need to act. While multiple options exist for reducing GHG emissions, the flexibility of a cap and trade program holds the most promise in making actual reductions in GHG emissions while minimizing, to the extent possible, overall energy cost increases. A cap and trade program with an appropriately designed agricultural offset program would provide farmers and ranchers a means to contribute to overall GHG emission reductions through carbon sequestration and reduction of emissions from livestock operations, while at the same time providing income to producers. That income turns over in local communities.
\
Since launching the Farmers Union Carbon Credit Program in 2006, Farmers Union has become the largest aggregator of carbon credits on the Chicago Climate Exchange. To date, almost $9.5 million has been earned for the nearly 4,000 Farmers Union members nationwide who have voluntarily committed to a legally binding contract to perform certain rules-based projects that are scientifically and independently verified. By using specific agricultural practices and prescribed land management, farmers and ranchers are being recognized for their achievements in capturing GHGs in the soil.
\
Our organization has learned valuable lessons on how to properly construct an offset program and hope Congress will utilize this hard work rather than try to recreate the wheel. Carbon sequestration projects on agricultural lands are the cheapest, easiest and most readily available means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions on a meaningful scale.
\
With an aggressive timetable to move climate change legislation through Congress, all of us need to urge lawmakers to support the following to ensure agriculture is allowed to play a significant role in helping reduce GHG emissions:
\
* Award the U.S. Department of Agriculture authority to determine the parameters, promulgate regulations, and serve as the administrator of an agricultural and forestry offset program;
\
* recognize the early programs to sequester carbon dioxide and allow those programs to be eligible under a mandated cap and trade system;
\
* avoid placing artificial limits on the use of domestic agricultural offsets; and
\
* base carbon sequestration rates upon science.
\
Some industries and individuals have raised objections to climate change policies, citing reasons from higher energy costs to questioning whether climate change is real. The reality is, climate change policies have already been adopted by other nations and the U.S. is certain to follow. Far fewer people today question whether global warming is real. The physical evidence has been mounting for years, and now that visual evidence has found an audience - think of the dramatic photos of receding glaciers - people are more ready to ask ""What should we do?"" I can appreciate the concern over costs. As I have demonstrated, agriculture can actually reduce emissions of GHGs while also pumping money back into rural communities. As to energy, we all understand aging power plants will need to be replaced and new plants are needed to meet the nation's growing demand for electricity. We have an opportunity to design plants that are more environmentally friendly. Consumers know creating a ""greener"" future takes a unified commitment. Indeed, voters across the United States are asking for a future that delivers more energy from wind turbines and renewables fuels. There are common sense ways of incorporating greener technology with our existing utility infrastructure.
\
The one cost that so far has been avoided by those debating climate change could be the most expensive in the long run: the cost of doing nothing. There is no doubt that from the industrial revolution on, human activity has affected the planet. We have come a long way since the days of acid rain, polluted rivers, toxic landfills and leaded gasoline. Our economy survived just fine and we have enjoyed a healthier environment. The time is now to enact an effective and intelligent climate change policy. Agriculture needs to be an integral component of the policy solutions we already have at hand.(Robert Carlson is president of North Dakota Farmers Union.)

As to energy, we all understand aging power plants will need to be replaced and new plants are needed to meet the nation's growing demand for electricity. We have an opportunity to design plants that are more environmentally friendly. Consumers know creating a ""greener"" future takes a unified commitment. Indeed, voters across the United States are asking for a future that delivers more energy from wind turbines and renewables fuels. There are common sense ways of incorporating greener technology with our existing utility infrastructure.
\
The one cost that so far has been avoided by those debating climate change could be the most expensive in the long run: the cost of doing nothing. There is no doubt that from the industrial revolution on, human activity has affected the planet. We have come a long way since the days of acid rain, polluted rivers, toxic landfills and leaded gasoline. Our economy survived just fine and we have enjoyed a healthier environment. The time is now to enact an effective and intelligent climate change policy. Agriculture needs to be an integral component of the policy solutions we already have at hand.

North Dakota's campaign disclosure laws continue to be among the weakest in the country, earning an ""F"" in the Center for Public Integrity's most recent survey released this week.
\
The center, a nonprofit group in Washington, D.C., issued its first 43-question survey to every state in 1999, which asks about legislators' employment, investments, personal finances, property holdings and other activities outside the legislature.
\
North Dakota dropped two places in this year's survey to 33rd, down from 31st in 2006 and 1999.
\
Among some of the weaknesses in North Dakota's campaign disclosure laws, according to the center are:
\
* No employer description is required, nor a requirement to disclose primary occupation.
\
* Financial disclosures are not required annually, only during election years.
\
* The state does not publish a list of delinquent filers.
\
Candidates in North Dakota also do not have to report expenses during a campaign.
\
""There's a differing of opinion of what constitutes a passing grade and a failing grade"" when it comes to campaign disclosure laws around the country, said Jim Silrum, the North Dakota deputy secretary of state.
\
He said campaign disclosure in North Dakota allows for people to give to candidates they may not otherwise give to because donations under $200 do not have to be reported.
\
Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, said the results of the survey did not surprise him.
\
""We operate in North Dakota under an illusion,"" he said, adding: ""Any of us can be led into trouble. The best way to stay out of trouble is more transparency and better reporting.""
\
No tweets from N.D.
\
Twitter might be mentioned on every other segment on cable news nowadays, but the micro-blogging social network hasn't convinced the likes of North Dakota's congressional delegation to join.
\
""I don't think most Americans want to have a politician tweeting where they ate a cheeseburger for lunch or what their most innermost thoughts are about hammers and nails,"" said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. ""I have not joined the chorus.""
\
If you were curious, Dorgan said he usually has a sandwich at his desk for lunch.
\
Sandra Salstrom, spokeswoman for Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., said the congressman prefers ""more traditional methods of communicating because they lend themselves to a greater level of dialogue than can be had in 140 characters."" He also has a Facebook page.
\
Sean Neary, spokesman for Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said the senator is considering signing up for a Twitter account.
\
Perhaps North Dakota's delegation is saving itself from becoming the butt of late-night comic jokes by avoiding Twitter.
\
Case in point - Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., who had this to say on his Twitter feed last week during the protests in Iran: ""Iranian twitter activity similar to what we did in House last year when Republicans were shut down in the House.""
\
Overstatement, anyone?
\
More hot air
\
An interest group in favor of the cap-and-trade legislation before Congress slammed Americans for Prosperity this week for its so-called ""Hot Air Tour.""
\
The Environmental Law and Policy Center called the event ""propaganda,"" which was slated to feature hot air balloon rides in Bismarck on Tuesday, but reportedly didn't because of weather.
\
""Americans for Prosperity is traveling the country, offering free hot air balloon rides to the public, and telling them scary half-truths about energy legislation and our country's environment,"" said Mindi Grieve, a spokeswoman for the Environmental Law & Policy Center. ""Frankly, Americans for Prosperity is full of hot air.""

A group of 11 North Dakotans with the group NDPeople.org went to Washington, D.C., for a Thursday rally on the National Mall in support of a public health insurance option.
\
Congress is considering many versions of health care reform this summer.
\
""Health care reform is either going to happen to us or we can take a part in the process,"" said Mathern, who was in Washington for the rally.

As the GOP heads into its state convention, the nomination for the U.S. House is the most contested race.
\
For Public Service Commission Chairman Kevin Cramer and Fargo legislator and businessman Rick Berg, the economy, job creation, energy and health care have been major issues of the campaign.
\
Both consider the economy and job creation to be priority No. 1, both are opposed to the health care bill and cap-and-trade, and both want to tackle the deficit.
\
While these issues are likely to be relevant to the 131st Congress, the House votes on a multitude of issues, many of which don't get extensive coverage during the campaign cycle.
\
The following are their views on the other issues.
\
Agriculture
\
Cramer:
\
* On NAFTA: ""If you're going to have a free trade agreement, it has to be fair. You can't handicap your producer while opening doors for another countries' producers,"" said Cramer.
\
* Conservation Reserve Program subsidies that give farmers money to take land out of production: ""My initial instinct is that we should not enhance the program by putting more money into it,"" he said. ""Capitalism is built on productivity, not chocking productivity.""
\
Berg:
\
* On the farm bill: ""I think the farm bill, like a lot of federal spending, needs to be based on the merits and not special perks. I support the farm bill; at the same time, I think there's things in the farm bill that need to go through the vetting of the legislative environment,"" he said.
\
* On CRP: ""I support the payments that provide the safety net for agriculture, but at the same time, people shouldn't be dependent, and farmers should have ability to plant best crops,"" he said. ""It's an ongoing balance between dollars available and productivity of the land.""
\
Ethics
\
Cramer:
\
* On campaign contributions: Does not want to limit political speech by reducing the $2,400 cap. ""What I will work for in Congress is legislation that simply states that if you can't vote for me, you can't contribute to me.""
\
* On earmarks: ""The reality is we can't have $14 trillion debt. We have to start balancing budgets. And as much as this might be unpopular in North Dakota, we might have to start sacrificing.""
\
Berg:
\
* On campaign contributions: Current election laws favor incumbents. ""I think campaign contributions should predominantly come from the people who elect you.""
\
* On earmarks: ""I think the No. 1 thing is projects must be based on merit, and those that are top priorities are ones that receive funding. It's gotten so out of whack in Washington. They've gotten away from merit, and if they get back to merit, they can get away from the deficit. And North Dakota will do well on merit.""
\
Foreign policy
\
Cramer:
\
* On a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq: Does not support. ""Even if we had timetable, the notion that we would announce it is so ludicrous to me. It's just ... unsafe. It makes no sense to me that we would tell our enemies when we're leaving.""
\
* On signing protocols: ""We have to remember we live in global economy and the world is shrinking, but signing away our sovereignty limits us as a nation. I think there are some bedrock principles you have to stand on, and that's this document,"" he said, holding up the Constitution.
\
* Nuclear proliferation: We should not enter into deals that would limit our sovereignty, but need ""to do everything we can to keep them out of hand of rogue nations and dictators.""
\
Berg:
\
* On a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq: ""What I would do is listen to the generals and the people closest to the conflict, and I would take their advice,"" said Berg, before setting an ""arbitrary deadline.""
\
* On signing protocols: ""As it's related to conflicts around the world, we should make that decision independently and not be bound by U.N. agreements. At the same time, we need to support democracies around the globe, but we need to maintain our sovereignty, absolutely.""
\
* On nuclear proliferation: Maintain the U.S. as ""the strongest military power in the world"" while monitoring rogue nations.
\
Social issues
\
Cramer:
\
* On gay marriage: Marriage should only be between a man and woman. Cramer said he holds this belief both because of his Christian values and studies that show the breakdown of the traditional family is linked to the breakdown of society.
\
* On abortion: Wants to work on legislation in Congress that would ""recognize the humanness of an embryo,"" but said society hasn't done enough for ""single moms and hurting people that would love to make a different choice.""
\
* On gays in the military: That decision is best left to the generals.
\
Berg:
\
* On gay marriage: ""I'm opposed to it.""
\
* On abortion: Pledges to support any bill that would challenge Roe v. Wade.
\
* On gays in the military: ""The 'don't ask, don't tell' policy they currently have, I think, should be maintained until the leaders of the military feel a change should be made, and then it should be looked at. It shouldn't be a political issue.""
\
Welfare
\
Cramer:
\
* On the role of government and welfare: More services provided by faith-based groups. ""I see better results at a fraction of the cost.""
\
* On Social Security: ""We've got to start somewhere. We've got to find a line that we draw, say 35, maybe 30, and say after that age there's a different program for you rather than putting money into a broken system.""
\
Berg:
\
* On the role of government and welfare: ""It's important that we help lift people up and enable them to become self-sufficient rather than many government programs that seem desgined to make people dependent on government.""
\
* On Social Security: ""It needs to be looked at to see if it's sustainable. I certainly don't advocate doing away with it; it's critical for a lot of people on fixed and limited income, but we need to find a way to make sure that promise can be delivered.""
\
Other
\
Would you vote against your values if you thought that was what the majority of North Dakotans wanted?
\
Cramer: ""I reject the idea of using polls or sticking your finger in the air to sense what people want. That's why it's a representative democracy - if you stay close to people, they stay close to you. If not, they vote you out in two years.""
\
Berg: ""I would feel there are very few things, in fact I can't think of anything, I don't agree with the general population on. I've been listening to the people for 26 years and that's what's created the environment we have in North Dakota. Representing those interests would be easy for me.""
\
What legislation would you introduce in your first year?
\
Cramer: In addition to the aforementioned bill on abortion and campaign finance, ""I will co-sponsor a bill to repeal the health care bill if it passes anywhere near the current form of either bill in Congress. Also, I will co-sponsor any bill that makes permanent the tax cuts that will expire if not renewed.""
\
Berg: ""My priority will be to get our economy going again; we need to encourage small businesses to grow.""

Fervent. 1. Hot, burning, glowing, boiling.
\
- Oxford English Dictionary
\
WASHINGTON - ""Fervently"" is how America will henceforth engage in talks on global warming. So said the president's climate change negotiator Sunday in Germany, at a U.N. conference on reducing carbon emissions. This vow was fervently applauded by conferees welcoming the end of what AP's news story called the Bush administration's ""eight years of obdurate participation"" in climate talks.
\
Reducing carbon emissions supposedly will reverse warming, if it resumes after the current period without warming, a period that began, according to statistics published by the World Meteorological Organization, 11 years ago. Regarding the reversing, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change has many ambitions, as outlined in a working group's 16-page ""information note"" to ""facilitate discussions."" For example:
\
""Tariffs can be lowered to grant special preference to climate-friendly goods, or they can be maintained at high levels to discourage trade in GHG (greenhouse gas)-intensive goods and services."" The working group says protectionism ""in the service of climate change objectives"" might virtuously ""shelter domestic producers of climate-friendly goods.""
\
Furthermore, using ""border carbon adjustment,"" a nation might virtuously ""impose costs on imports equivalent to that (sic) faced by domestic producers"" operating under a carbon tax. Or a nation with a cap-and-trade regime regulating carbon emissions by domestic manufacturers might require foreign manufacturers ""to buy offsets at the border equal to that (sic) which the producer would have been forced to purchase had the good been produced domestically.""
\
Cynics will see only potential for mischief by governments, including the U.S. government, using such measures to give a green patina to protectionism. Meanwhile, the U.S. government is having its own problems with one ""climate-friendly good"" that might not be. Last week, The New York Times front page carried this headline: ""The Bulb That Saved the Planet May Be a Little Less Than Billed.""
\
The story recounted some Americans' misadventures with the new light bulbs that almost all Americans - all but those who are filling their closets with supplies of today's incandescent bulbs - will have to use after the phaseout of today's bulbs in 2014. (You missed that provision of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007?)
\
A San Francisco - naturally - couple emerged from Al Gore's movie ""An Inconvenient Truth"" incandescent with desire to think globally and act locally, in their home. So they replaced their incandescent bulbs with the compact fluorescents that Congress says must soon be ubiquitous. ""Instead of having a satisfying green moment, however,"" the Times reported, ""they wound up coping with a mess.""
\
Although supposed to last 10,000 hours and save, the Times says, ""as much as"" $5.40 a year in electricity costs, some bulbs died within a few hours. Some experts, reports the Times, ""blame the government for the quality problems,"" saying its push to cut the bulbs' prices prompted manufacturers to use inferior components.
\
Furthermore, some experts have written a guide saying the new bulbs require ""a little insight and planning."" The Times says that ""may be an understatement.""
\
The bulbs, says the Times, ""do not do well in hot places with little airflow, like recessed ceiling fixtures,"" and some do not work ""with dimmers or three-way sockets."" And: ""Be aware that compact fluorescents can take one to three minutes to reach full brightness. This is not a defect."" Well, if you say so. Because all fluorescents contain mercury, a toxic metal, they must never be put in the trash, so Home Depot and other chains offer bins for disposing of dangerous bulbs. Driving to one of these disposal points might not entirely nullify the bulbs' environmental benefits. Besides, the Times summarizes the Environmental Protection Agency's helpful suggestions for coping with the environmental dangers caused when one of these environment-saving bulbs breaks:
\
""Clear people and pets from the room and open a window for at least 15 minutes if possible. Avoid vacuuming. Scoop up larger pieces with stiff paper or cardboard, pick up smaller residue with sticky tape, and wipe the area with a damp cloth. Put everything into a sealed plastic bag or sealed glass jar. In most cases, this can be put in the trash, but the EPA recommends checking local rules.""
\
Worrywarts wonder what will happen when a lazy or careless, say, 10 percent of 300 million Americans put their worn-out bulbs in the trash. Stop worrying. What do you think? That Congress, architect of the ethanol industry and designer of automobiles, does not think things through?

Diversity is THE word for the energy future of North Dakota and America.
\
North Dakota's congressional delegation has said little is off the table in terms of America's energy future.
\
With a push to decrease America's dependence on foreign oil, traditional and renewable energy sources will be part of the picture, even if we don't use them the same way.
\
""Coal is our most abundant resource, and it's not going anywhere,"" said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., adding that new technologies will keep the industry viable.
\
He said the same is true with fossil fuels as the president and other Democrats embrace offshore drilling.
\
But the major growth in industry could be in renewables. Although North Dakota produces about 1,200 megawatts of wind energy, projects now in their infancy will later bring that number to more than 7,000 megawatts. Ethanol and biomass production have yet to meet their potential.
\
All of these energy sources are likely to be part of a future national plan, Conrad said.
\
""We took the approach that you have to do some of a lot of different things,"" he said, including conservation efforts and pushing more technology by way of electric cars and nuclear power. ""Our country would be so much better off if, instead of sending money to the Middle East, we put that money in the Midwest.""
\
And with a variety of energy products, more investment could be big for North Dakota.
\
""I believe it is the greatest opportunity for our state in my lifetime in every facet,"" Conrad said.
\
But for all its potential, North Dakota's energy industries might be held back by a lack of ways to transmit its product.
\
""North Dakota is a big landlocked state that produces lots of stuff,"" said Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., pointing to the number of products that rely on train and truck for shipping. ""These are the kind of issues a place like North Dakota has always had to deal with and always will have to deal with to make the most of its energy future. We're an exporter. We're an important energy exporter. And getting our products to market, be it ethanol, wind power or oil is always going to be an important part of making the most our opportunity,"" he said.
\
The state has expanded its pipeline capacity, shipping crude to Chicago for refining, but the challenge of connecting various sources of electricity to interstate transmission lines could make for a real road block both for coal and renewable sources.
\
In-state lines can be built with less hassle, but getting energy to bordering states will require a lot of work legislatively - troublesome news for a state that can produce more energy than it can use.
\
""It has to be a national issue,"" said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. ""We're not going to build a superhighway of transmission lines without having federal legislation to do it. Because you almost can't build interstate high voltage lines in this country now. The reason you can't do it is because you have local jurisdictions and state jurisdictions that can say no, and they stop these things.""
\
Doing it regionally, however, could avoid some of these issues, said Bob Ambrose, director of governmental affairs for Great River Energy.
\
""Whether it's a federal highways or more robust regional transmission system, there may be more than one way to do it, but the need is certainly there,"" Ambrose said. ""The distinction I would make here is that with a regional system you may be able to site that without the federal government directly acquiring property and that sort of thing.""
\
Despite all his work on transmission on the state level, as Gov. John Hoeven makes his bid to move to the Senate, he sees transmission as a federal issue.
\
""The challenge comes when we got beyond our border - that's where federal government needs to play a role,"" Hoeven said because it stalls business interests. ""Companies need to know what permission they need to get and when they spend money what rate of return they're going to get on that. Right now it is so complicated, and it takes these companies so long to get permitted.""
\
In addition to infrastructure, regulations also could play a hand in slowing North Dakota's energy future. Many point to cap and trade and the Environmental Protection Agency as problem areas for development.
\
But according to Dorgan and Pomeroy, cap and trade as we now know it is essentially dead.
\
While the bill passed in the House, ""it doesn't have the votes to pass the Senate,"" said Dorgan.
\
But a measure to stifle carbon emissions is likely, he said.
\
He favors a plan using a cap and dividend, capping carbon but returning money to taxpayers to help offset the higher costs of energy to the consumer.
\
Dorgan said he's hopeful that new technology will find a way to make carbon a product rather than a problem.
\
""These ideas give me great hope and offer great promise that we can use coal resources in a different way that allows us to use coal and protect the environment,"" he said.
\
Bismarck Sen. Tracy Potter, Hoeven's competition for Dorgan's Senate seat, said he is in favor of regulating carbon, but worries about the impact it could have on the economy.
\
""We cannot solve it alone because if the United States does this all by itself and takes the economic costs associated with controlling our carbon at the same time Third World nations are developing their economies and contributing to global warming then we're just treading water and we're only hurting ourselves. This has to be a global cooperative effort,"" Potter said.
\
Other regulations that could hurt coal may come from the EPA, which has decided to back off the idea of regulating greenhouse gases, giving Congress time to act.
\
""There are very few people that I know that want the EPA to act unilaterally,"" Dorgan said.
\
To stop the EPA, Pomeroy said options lie in passing a bill to stop them from regulating in certain areas or in putting restrictions on its budget, halting the EPA from acting before Congress.
\
Conrad said senators are still working to build consensus around a plan that would simply bar the EPA from regulating greenhouse gasses for one to two years to provide Congress with a window to legislate.
\
""At the same time its difficult to get 60 votes to pass climate legislation, it's equally difficult to get the 60 votes to stop the EPA from getting carbon into the Clean Air Act,"" Ambrose said. ""One difficulty in enacting that piece of legislation to say the EPA has to back off, is that its highly unlikely that the president would sign that legislation, even if it got through congress.""
\
Fargo Rep. Rick Berg, who is challenging Pomeroy for his House seat, also has concerns that such legislation could pass, especially as long as Democrats are in power, he said.
\
""People are trying to placate the public to say I'm trying to prevent them from doing this. Well introducing a bill doesn't mean anything, said Berg. ""It's easy for a politician to say I've introduce a bill to stop the EPA, but unless it passes it won't have an impact.""
\
Incentives for North Dakota's energy industries also could take some legislation.
\
The delegation is in favor of tax incentives for energy companies, but time is ticking as some credits are about to expire, while others are in the process of being created.
\
Pomeroy said he wants to see a tax policy that gives oil companies tax credits up front rather than over the life of the well.
\
Meanwhile, tax credits for the biodiesel industry have expired and those for ethanol expire this year, though bills have been introduced to renew them.
\
""It may be easier than getting a tax credit for fossil fuels, but I'd say its still not easy"" Ambrose said, to get credits for renewables, ""maybe less difficult. It's still far from certain that it would happen.""
\
Also on the horizon for the state is changing leadership. The retirement of Dorgan ensures there will be at least one new member of ""team North Dakota.""

Energy is a matter of national security, according to a group of veterans pushing for less use of foreign oil.
\
Hitting the road with a biofuel bus, the National Veterans Tour for Clean Energy & Security came to Bismarck as part of Operation Free. Its mission is promoting a switch to domestic sources of power in place of sending troops overseas to secure fossil fuels.
\
Four veterans from the organization came to talk about how serving in the military changed their world view and their take on energy.
\
""Even then we knew it was about oil, obviously,"" said Patrick Bellon of his time in Iraq. ""When you join the service, you get inculcated with certain values of honesty and integrity, and our current energy policy doesn't allow us to do that.""
\
Bellon said the need for oil forces America to align itself with countries it otherwise wouldn't.
\
""When we fill up our cars, we're sending money, a portion of that money, to countries and people that want us and our way of life dead,"" said Matt Victoriano, a former Marine Corps sniper.
\
The veterans said transitioning away from foreign oil has little to do with cap-and-trade and won't kill jobs. Rather, they say, new jobs will be created in the green jobs market. The group wants to see more wind, solar and domestic forms of energy.
\
""We're smart. Americans are smart,"" said Victoriano. ""We can implement this reform without taking people' jobs away.""
\
The group said the criticism they've gotten from the coal industry about their idea isn't justified. They said they support coal and technologies that would reduce its carbon emissions.
\
Despite arguments from the coal industry that a turn to alternative fuels and a cleaner environment would result in fewer coal jobs, the group said that's not the case.
\
""The coal industry doesn't care about jobs, all they care about is making money,"" said Bellon.
\
The group said its main goal isn't to stop climate change as much as keep soldiers out of harm's way for oil. A cleaner environment, Bellon said, would just be a bonus.
\
""A lot of people don't think climate change exists, but the CIA and Department of Defense do, and you know how liberal they are,"" Bellon said jokingly.
\
The group encouraged people to contact their congressional delegation asking for alternatives to foreign oil.
\
""Politicians want to do the right thing, "" said Eric Gage, a former soldier with the Air Guard. ""They just need support from their constituents.""

Not a day passes without reflection on significant national concerns, people and their actions, governmental responses and the ongoing rolling convention of the world's worst drivers - who seem to have permanently congregated on the streets of Bismarck, N.D.
\
These are a few of my favorite peeves.
\
The serious peeves suggest a song by the Five Man Electrical Band. The little-more-than-one-hit-wonder Canadian rock group sang more than 30 years ago: ""Oh, sign, sign, everywhere a sign, blocking up the scenery, breaking my mind."" Lest we forget, it was also made clear that ""long-haired freaky people need not apply."" What a shame.
\
So what does the trip down memory lane have to do with anything?
\
The warnings and signs of authority are still posted at intersections, on the sides of roads and in other places, blocking the physical and mental views of our paths, seeking to command, control or at least influence our actions. Often it is for our own good, but not always.
\
Today, there are serious nonvisual signs - really scary ones - in words, stories and thoughts from national mouthpieces. And the pictures being painted, or non-surgically implanted in our minds, aren't pretty.
\
Health care, the environment, energy, economics, immigration and morality are on our minds, or at least on my mind. One might call them the six pillars on which our nation will stand or fall. And the outcome depends upon how we strengthen, rebuild or tear down those life standards over the next several years.
\
Lengthy theoretical essays and policy papers have been and could be written about each pillar; some are available, but a lack of space and personal expertise does not allow as much in this column. But let's look at three premises and some additional basic considerations.
\
First, we, as a nation, are entering seminal times. How we proceed will have much influence over the development of the future and life as we know it. Second, who can we trust (do we want more government in, or out, of our lives)? Third, we shouldn't allow anyone to force quick, poorly thought-out decisions on the American people.
\
Health care reform is needed. But is everyone ""deserving"" of basic health care, or simply the availability for affordable basic care? At what cost? Should it be free? What is basic? What platform(s) will/won't work? Who should pay? Shouldn't everyone pay something? Are private providers charging and making too much money?
\
Now is the time to speak your piece. Health care, as much as any other major issue of these times, demonstrates the dilemmas we face. Like everything, the devil is in the details.
\
We must respect our environment, but what is needed is a realistic approach that serves the greatest number of people rather than special interests (cap-and-trade is not the answer). Overreaction is just as bad as nonacceptance of the problem. Asking an addict to kick a habit cold turkey can work, but isn't always the best approach following years of excess - and considering the large number of those addicted.
\
The economy must be stimulated - but not overly so. A water faucet flowing freely will eventually break, causing other problems, or drip itself dry. Consider this: The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act passed in Congress to guard against a recurrence of major monetary losses at our banks and other institutions has a cost analyis of about $500 million over two years. Who's paying for that?
\
We need energy independence, but we can't get it by turning our back on all of our resources. Our plan must be inclusive of all options and levels of reliability. Exclusion or overreliance on any resource or initiative is short-sighted and sure to backfire.
\
It's a numbers game. America has always welcomed the tired and poor, the ""huddled masses yearning to breathe free."" But isn't it time we count the cost and set manageable controls and limits? Theaters, restaurants and buses have ""occupancy loads"" based on safe accommodation. Have you ever wondered why North Dakota is doing better than most other states? Could it have anything to do with the fact we only have 635,000 people here?
\
Finally, we as a nation seem to have a broken morality compass. We aren't always right-headed, finding justifications that don't point anywhere near any direction, floating around and around the compass blown by winds and whims.
\
These are times when decision-makers deserve our support, when possible. But, more importantly, when we can't agree, our leaders need our honesty and respectful challenge to the authority the electorate has empowered them with.
\
No one automatically deserves blind trust. And when leaders block the scenery to the future, or try to break our minds by ignoring our will, then they need to be removed from those seats of service.

'Stewardship' is anything but
\
By ERIC AASMUNDSTAD
\
Devils Lake
\
Doomsday pop-culture legislation is back in Congress. The ""global warming"" catastrophe film released earlier this summer, ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" has no basis in fact, but it served as a springboard to reintroduce bad legislation: S. 139, the McCain- Lieberman ""Climate Stewardship Act.""
\
This legislation would establish mandatory greenhouse gas emission reductions in the United States in an effort to reverse the one-degree increase in surface temperatures over the past century, otherwise known as global warming. The costs incurred will be in the billions of dollars.
\
Unfortunately, that is not the worst of it.
\
The real problem with this kind of legislation is that it takes money out of consumers' pockets, estimated at an average of $2,600 per household. Yet, there is no conclusive evidence that the increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit over the past 100 years was caused by human-induced greenhouse-gas emissions, or that a 1-degree increase is detrimental to the environment.
\
North Dakota farmers, ranchers and rural communities would feel a substantial impact. Energy-intensive agriculture would be hit particularly hard, with many farmers likely being put out of business. It would dramatically increase electricity costs for consumers and businesses and put reliable energy supplies at risk. It would cause the loss of jobs across the state and cause significant harm to the state's economy.
\
S.139 supporters have publicly stated that it is a ""good start,"" which means it is only the beginning of even more-damaging restrictions on emissions, leading to higher energy costs for America's farmers and ranchers and ultimately every American consumer.
\
Maintaining a positive economic future for North Dakota and agriculture requires policies that increase, not hamper, the abundant energy sources available in the state, including oil, gas, coal and renewable energy resources. S. 139 would do just the opposite.
\
The Farm Bureau supports the voluntary establishment of a trading system for carbon and other greenhouse gasses, but it strongly opposes a mandatory cap and trade program. Common sense, not doomsday pop culture, must take center stage to make the system work for all of us.

Fat's in fire now

\
Marriage has been under fire for some time by liberal special interests, but now it's in danger of being burned to the ground. And U.S. Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad have helped light the match.
\
By voting against the Federal Marriage Amendment, Dorgan and Conrad have paved the way for a radical redefinition of the institution on which civilization has been based for 5,000 years.
\
The FMA would have defined marriage, in the U.S. Constitution, as solely the union of one man and one woman.
\
Now that it's failed, there's nothing stopping activist judges like those on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court from creating not only gay marriage but legalizing polygamy and even marriages between people and their pets, brothers and sisters, and fathers and their daughters. You can just imagine the possible combinations.
\
Dorgan and Conrad helped bring this travesty about, regardless of what constituents like you and me felt about the situation. Each of us needs to remember that the next time they look to us for votes.

\
WASHINGTON - President-elect Barack Obama has pledged to cut America's carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050 - a goal that most of the world's scientists believe is vital to avoid catastrophic global climate change.
\
In a recent video message to a U.S. Governors' Conference on global warming headed by California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Obama assured the governors of both parties that his administration will ""engage vigorously"" in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and confirmed that stopping climate change will be among his administration's highest priorities.
\
That goal will involve considerable sacrifice, but it is achievable. Using the ""bully pulpit"" of the White House, Obama will be able to move Americans to make the lifestyle changes necessary to reduce drastically their currently oversized carbon footprint to a trimmer, energy-efficient size by mid-century.
\
With the Congress on his side, our eloquent new president will be able to follow through on the promises he made to the governors. His aggressive plan to put the United States in the avant garde of global environmental leaders already has the support of key congressional committee leadership, including the new incoming chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.
\
Obama's plan, which will rely on a free-market oriented federal carbon cap and trade system, also foresees a cut in carbon emissions from U.S.-manufactured cars by 5 percent in 2015 and by 10 percent in 2020.
\
He likely will have the powerful leverage of a multi-billion dollar federal bailout to force Detroit's Big Three automakers to comply with his goals. The U.S. carmakers - who once stoutly resisted eco-friendly advances - realize the guaranteed loans and other aid flowing from Washington depend on switching most of their production to electric, hybrid and flexible fuel vehicles.
\
The president-elect also told the governors that he will spend $15 billion a year to ""catalyze a clean energy future"" that will see a shift to solar, wind and new generation bio-fuels while also relying on clean coal and safe nuclear power.
\
That commitment, along with a pledge to create 5 million ""green jobs"" in America - jobs that cannot be outsourced and will pay acceptable salaries - should see Obama move steadily toward his goal of an 80 percent slash in carbon emissions by the half-century mark.
\
After eight years of the Bush administration discounting the threat of a rapidly warming planet, Obama is keenly aware that far too much valuable time already has been wasted.
\
""Now is the time to confront this challenge once and for all,"" he told the governors. ""Delay is no longer an option; denial is no longer an acceptable response. The stakes are too high; the consequences too serious. Stopping climate change won't be easy and it won't happen overnight."" Obama's words are exactly the message a 21st century American president should be sending to his citizens, to all levels of government and to leaders of private industry. It is a ringing declaration of world unity that leaders of other nations have not heard during the last eight years of the Bush and Cheney misadministration.
\
His vow to ""make America greener and end the tyranny of oil"" has been applauded around the globe and eases the way for meaningful U.S. participation at the coming U.N. summit on the environment next year in Copenhagen.
\
Obama's inspiring words are exactly what all who participate in reversing the pending catastrophe of climate change must hear and heed to save our Earth and make it inhabitable for its 6.3 billion humans and future generations.
\
Far from a mission impossible, it should be considered a quest that is sacrosanct. If we are unsuccessful, our small planet almost surely will wither and die.

The estimates of the volume of oil escaping from the BP well in the Gulf continue to inflate. Given the inability over the past two months to cap the well, assurance from President Obama in his Oval Office address Tuesday that 90 percent of the oil leaking would be captured within ""the coming weeks and days"" fell flat. The well must be capped, and that seems far from assured at this point.
\
And we will hold the president to his promise that, ""We will fight this spill with everything we've got for as long as it takes. We will make BP accountable for the damage their company has caused. And we will do whatever's necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy.""
\
While BP must be held accountable for its actions, everyone - Gulf Coast residents, all other U.S. citizens and the wetlands and wildlife - are best served by BP as a viable business interest. If the multinational oil company would go bankrupt, who would pay for the cleanup and the economic loss? A company that showed about $17 billion in profit last year, BP had lost a third of its value between the April 20 blowout at the Deepwater Horizon well and last week. Obama's ""we will make BP pay"" is predicated on BP being able to pay.
\
Contrary to views otherwise, there's a link among the Deepwater Horizon disaster, energy legislation in Congress and U.S. energy consumption. Americans need to acknowledge their extensive use of oil - foreign and domestic - helped provide the market that drove BP to drop a well in such a risky deep- water environment. There's a cause and effect relationship between the disaster and our highway miles, and it isn't a very pleasant result.
\
Public sentiment (and behavior) on oil consumption, efficiency and energy independence ought to drive Congress to pass an energy and climate bill that makes sense. The public is, after all, the market, and we are all about letting the market decide. Clearly, cap-and-trade is out. But, now, what's in? What will the Republicans and Democrats in the Senate craft and can it be sold to the House? The time has come to resolve these questions.
\
Finally, the confusion surrounding the response to the disaster, by BP and the federal government, is unacceptable. The same goes for sloppy monitoring and regulation of the drilling by government agencies and by the individual companies in the industry. That must be fixed.
\
It's difficult to believe the administration can't sit down with industry experts and other qualified people, including those from BP, and come up with a way to stop the flow of spilled oil. Perhaps, no one is asking the right questions. The administration has also been slow to accept help from other countries, especially in the clean-up operation.
\
Politics and public opinion aside, the well must be plugged and the oil removed from the oceans, coastal westlands and beaches.
\
Mr. President, we are not reassured.

Trent Loos raises cattle instead of producing electricity, but he believes the agriculture and energy industries have the same challenges dealing with public misunderstanding of what they do.
\
""We can talk all day about reducing carbon emissions in the coal industry,"" Loos said, but convincing the public that coal is a clean energy source and important to the economy will not work until people in the industry work to clear up misconceptions. The issue is the same in agriculture when it comes to its impact on the environment and the consumer.
\
Loos was the keynote speaker at the Lignite Energy Council's annual meeting in Bismarck on Wednesday. The two-day industry meeting is organized around the theme of climate change and pending legislation related to it. Loos' talk focused on the industry's need to remind the public of the benefits of energy production when perceptions might be influenced by its negative impacts.
\
""It's always 'I heard,' never 'I know,'"" Loos said. A coal-fired power plant can provide jobs and economic benefit, but those benefits have to compete with rumors that a project will, for example, cause two-headed births. ""Never will the economic argument outweigh the kids with two heads.""
\
The coal industry might be feeling understandable defensive now. Climate change legislation has risen to the top of the policy agenda in Washington. The House of Representatives has passed a cap-and-trade bill that places limits on carbon emissions and allows polluting industries to buy emissions credits from cleaner firms. A version of the legislation will go to the Senate next.
\
Lignite Council Communications Director Steve Van Dyke said the meeting was a chance for the industry to talk about climate change legislation and its potential impact. Even though attendees work in the coal industry, ""it doesn't mean they're experts on the Kerry-Boxer (climate) bill and what that contains,"" he said.
\
The meeting continues today with a panel discussion by North Dakota's congressional delegation on climate legislation.
\
Loos, dressed in cowboy attire and sporting a full moustache, looks like a rancher, but also is a Nebraska-based talk radio host and has a sideline in speaking engagements like the lignite meeting. He encouraged attendees to put a human face on the coal industry.
\
""As long as lignite industry is industry"" in the public's mind instead of actual people, it will be hard to change perceptions, he said.

California, following up on an initiative of former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, is implementing its own cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gases.
\
Minnesota passed a law limiting the state's utilities' ability to import electricity from new coal-fired plants in other states. North Dakota, which has enormous deposits of low-BTU coal and which generates more than three times as much electricity as the state itself uses, is now suing Minnesota for interfering in interstate commerce. Other states are watching the suit closely.
\
Both California's and Minnesota's measures are intended to reduce environmental harm from electricity generation. Such harm includes climate change from greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has become politically charged, to put it mildly.
\
North Dakota argues that the law will have little effect on global warming. This is true since other emitters are not cutting back and some, particularly in newly industrializing countries like China and India, are increasing emissions rapidly.
\
This position is supported by economic theory that demonstrates individuals, or states, have little incentive to take some positive action when other ""free riders"" don't. This is an outcome of the game theory analysis that has come to play a major role in economics.
\
Economic theory also supports the argument that if one political jurisdiction, state or nation, takes some isolated action that increases the cost of a major input like electricity, businesses located there will face higher costs than their competitors in other areas that avoid similar actions. Output and employment will be lower than otherwise, as will cash incomes for residents.
\
If the area in question gains substantial non-monetary benefits, such as improved environmental quality for the current generation or their descendants, then the trade-off nevertheless may be a good one. But if the benefits are small, or most of them accrue to people elsewhere who make no current sacrifice, then the result is a lowering of the economic well-being of the group.
\
Yet many feel that climate change is a moral issue on which they must take a stand - by not only reducing emissions caused by their own consumption, but those of our society as a whole, even if that has a significant economic cost. They also argue that if a few states take the initiative, others may follow.
\
That sort of ""here I stand, I can do no other"" position is familiar to most people. Nearly everyone has some belief, some moral value, that supersedes any calculation of cost and benefit.
\
Unfortunately, such issues vary from one person to another. For one it may be the environment; for another, abortion; for a third, freedom from government intrusion; and so on.
\
Jeremy Bentham, the 19th-century philosopher, argued that public policies should result in ""the greatest good for the greatest number."" Humans, he said, make a ""hedonic calculus"" weighing the pleasure and pain derived from each alternative in life. The same should hold true for collective decisions that affect society as a whole. This approach became known as ""utilitarianism.""
\
Unfortunately, we cannot measure ""utility"" or human satisfaction in any objective or quantifiable manner. And thus there is no way of knowing what set of policies produces the greatest satisfaction for society at any given juncture. Moreover, barring any dramatic breakthrough in neurology or psychology, perhaps we never will.
\
Yet society must somehow decide divisive issues on which people have deep moral convictions. It took a century for us to resolve slavery and the bloodiest war in our history. All subsequent issues, including abortion, women's rights and climate change, pale in comparison.
\
What is clear is that economic analysis is limited. Microeconomists like Nobel laureate Gary Becker and Gordon Tullock extended economic analysis to individual personal decisions like marrying or having children. Their insights are useful, even if the decisions are far more complex than Becker or Tullock admit. But when it comes to collective societal choices, economists cannot say much. We know that democracy is the best process for making such choices, but can add little beyond that.

What will the polarized, acrimonious national political environment of the past year mean to the upcoming North Dakota races for the Legislature, statewide offices and Congress?
\
It will, I think, mean something nasty unless the majority of people in the state ""just say no"" to candidates associated with name- calling, insults, dishonest characterizations of another's position, whisper campaigns and other general political meanness and dishonesty.
\
That goes for their minions, too.
\
When potential voters say no, candidates listen. (What they listen to most closely are the polls and the snap of a campaign contributor's checkbook closing.)
\
This summer and fall were atypical for off-election-year political advertising. It was keyed to health care reform and made a case for North Dakota having become a battle ground for high-stake national issues. That flow of issue-oriented cash may continue during the coming campaigns. Unfortunately not all of those issue ads were strong on truth telling. Beware.
\
Also, the frothy churn of accusatory letters to the editor of the past year - cap and trade, health care reform, Wall Street buyout and stimulus funds - have seeded the local discourse with distrust
\
And then there's the actual talk radio. Disheartening.
\
There is, as you can smell, a bad odor in the air as we begin.
\
It doesn't have to stay this way.
\
None of the candidates, or those people mentioned as candidates, are directly related to either the out-of-state issue ads, talk radio nonsense or dispiriting letters to the editor. While people should expect tough talk from candidates, they should also be able to expect civil discourse from the candidates and their staffs.
\
Actually, a majority of the trash-talking will come not from the candidates but from planted dirty tricksters, political wanabees and ideological true believers. What you have to do is, excuse the Obamaism, connect the dots between the crank and the candidate. And when you do that, say no.
\
We've got a long way to go. Here's the timeline: The state's political conventions are less than three months off. The GOPwill meet March 19-21 in Grand Forks. The Democrats will meet March 25-28 in Fargo. The state primary will be June 8, and the general election Nov. 2.
\
Things will warm up politically. The temptation to throw a dig, and then dirt, will be inevitable.
\
The people, however, do not have to take it. They can say no. Not only that, they can vote for the other candidate, or, if that's too painful, they can write in a name.
\
There are always columns like this at the beginning of the election season, about how campaigns should be upright and civil. They don't do much good. But coming off a year that was profoundly negative and grumpy, I figure it's worth making the case for civility one more time. I hope people will do more than just tune out the negative political interference and noise. Ihope they turn off the people who spew it.
\
I guess it comes down to respecting each others' opinions. Not agreeing with them. Respecting them.
\
If we can't do that, what can we do?

WASHINGTON - Intelligent people agree that, absent immediate radical action regarding global warming, the human race is sunk. That is a tautology because those who do not agree are, definitionally, unintelligent. Britain's intelligent Prime Minister Gordon Brown gives scary precision to the word ""immediate."" By his reckoning, humanity now has about 30 days to save itself. He says that unless a decisive agreement is reached at the 192-nation summit on climate change that opens Dec. 7 in Copenhagen, all is lost.
\
So, all is lost. The chances of a comprehensive and binding treaty are approximately nil.
\
The fourth of five parlays preparing for Copenhagen occurred in Bangkok from Sept. 28 through Oct. 9, with delegates from about 180 nations participating. Remember diplomat George Kennan's axiom that the unlikelihood of reaching an agreement is the square of the number of parties at the table? The meeting adjourned with, as usual, essentially no progress toward an agreement on reduced emissions by developed nations or on the money such nations should pay to finance developing nations' efforts against global warming.
\
The New York Times reports that ""the United Nations Adaptation Fund, which officially began operating in 2008 to help poor countries finance projects to blunt the effects of global warming, remains an empty shell, largely because rich nations have failed to come through with the donations they promised."" The fund has a risible $18 million, which might not cover the cost of Copenhagen conference.
\
There they will experience more futility because of, among other things, two stubborn facts - the two most populous nations. On Oct. 21, China, the world's leading emitter of greenhouse gases, and India, which ranks fourth - together they account for 26 percent of emissions - jointly agreed: They, with their combined one-third of the world's population, will not play in what increasingly resembles a global game of climate-change charades. Neither nation is interested in jeopardizing its economic growth with emission caps of a sort that never impeded the growth of the developed nations that now praise them.
\
But do not really embrace them. Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives took time out from fending off the world and exempted large cattle, dairy and hog producing operations from an Environmental Protection Agency requirement for reporting greenhouse gas emissions. And 13 Great Lakes cargo ships were exempted from a proposed mandate requiring the use of low-sulfur fuel. When constituents' interests conflict with global grandstanding, Congress' rule is ""act locally, think globally tomorrow, maybe.""
\
In their new book, ""SuperFreakonomics,"" Steven D. Levitt, a University of Chicago economist, and Stephen J. Dubner, a journalist, worry about global warming but revive some inconvenient memories of 30 years ago. Then intelligent people agreed (see above) that global cooling threatened human survival. It had, Newsweek reported, ""taken the planet about a sixth of the way toward the Ice Age average.""
\
Levitt and Dubner also spoil some of the fun of the sort of the ""think globally, act locally"" gestures that are liturgically important in the church of climate change. For example, they say the ""locavore"" movement - people eating locally grown foods from small farms - actually increases greenhouse gas emissions. They cite research showing that only 11 percent of such emissions associated with food are in the transportation of it; 80 percent are in the production phase and, regarding emissions, big farms are much more efficient.
\
Although the political and media drumbeat of alarm is incessant, a Pew poll shows that only 57 percent of Americans think there is solid evidence of global warming, down 20 points in three years. Gallup shows that only 1 percent of Americans rank the environment as their biggest worry. Two reasons are:
\
They are worried about their wages, which will not be improved by clobbering a weak economy with the costs of a cap-and-trade carbon-reduction regime. And climate Cassandras are learning the wages of crying ""Wolf!"" In 2005, global warming worriers warned, as they tend to do after all adverse or anomalous environmental events, that Hurricane Katrina was caused by global warming and foreshadowed an increase in the number and destructiveness of hurricanes. As this year's Atlantic hurricane season ends, only three hurricanes have formed - half the average of the last 50 years - and none have hit the United States.

How harmful is climate change?
\
Scientists, we are told by other scientists, are a sober dispassionate lot when it comes to climate science. They've sifted through reams of data covering millions of years and have proved conclusively that global warming is caused by human activity.
\
They applaud our senators' votes against the Murkowski amendment that would have prevented the EPA from implementing rules limiting greenhouse gasses.
\
Consider the remarks of the United Nation's chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Rajendra Pachauri, concerning skeptics of global warming.
\
""They are the same people who deny the link between smoking and cancer. They are the people who say asbestos is good as talcum powder - and I hope they put it on their faces every day,""he states.
\
Rational?
\
The earth's climate is a complex system, but scientists working in the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in Britain were exposed for manipulating data to fit their theories on global warming. They play a prominent role in advising the IPCC.
\
A report issued in 2007 by the IPCC on the science of climate change used the terms ""uncertain"" or ""uncertainty"" more than 1,300 times in 900 pages. It also states the level of scientific understanding of key aspects of climate change was ""low"" or ""very low.""
\
The IPCC report is said to be a consensus of 2,000 of the world's top scientists. That figure may be misleading because the number of active scientists in the work of CRU and related institutions in the U.S. is relatively small. There are thousands of other scientists working on aspects of climate change who do not participate in the IPCC process and dissent form ""consensus.""
\
""Global warming"" has morphed to ""climate change"" in a few short years.
\
Of course, humans have an effect on the climate, as does every other living thing on the planet.
\
The question is, Is that effect as harmful as some would have us believe or are they just blowing hot air?
\
I've drawn my conclusion.

Facts about N.D. teen pregnancy
\
Sen. Thomas Fiebiger sounds the alarm on rates of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections in his June 24 letter.
\
His concern is valid; the information that he chose to share, however, deserves closer scrutiny.
\
Fiebiger quotes the state Division of Vital Records for teen pregnancy rates, for instance. The term ""teen pregnancy"" conjures up images of very young pregnant teens. Understand that ""teen"" as defined by the state refers to those under the age of 20.
\
In 2008 for North Dakota residents, ages 16 and under, there were 115 pregnancies. For N.D. residents, ages 17 to 19, there were 718 pregnancies.
\
Eighty-six percent of teen pregnancies in the state were among 17-19 year olds - an age when young people are attending college, entering the workforce and getting married and are not in classrooms where abstinence education is being taught.
\
North Dakota ranks 46th in rate of teen pregnancy, among the lowest in the nation. Teen pregnancy rates, in 15- to 19-year-olds, decreased in our state by 21 percent from 1988 to 2005. Incidentally, it is in the past 15 to 20 years that abstinence education programs have become a positive presence. A robust body of research has begun to show that many of these programs do, indeed, make a difference.
\
Fiebiger charges that abstinence programs ""deny teenagers medically accurate information.""
\
This is contrary to what the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states: ""The surest way to avoid transmission of STDs is to abstain from sexual contact, or to be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and is known to be uninfected.""
\
Veteran psychiatrist Miriam Grossman, author of ""You're Teaching My Child What? A Physician Exposes the Lies of Sex Education and How They Harm Your Child,"" shares extensive research into comprehensive sex education, programs that jeopardize the physical and emotional health of our children. Once parents realize what is really included in these programs, they turn overwhelmingly in favor of abstinence centered programs.
\
We need to pay attention to rates of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.
\
We also need to make sure that we know the whole story - not just part of it. Kids don't get pregnant and they don't get infected if they do not have sex.

Demos to blame for oil crisis
\
President Obama is looking for ""whose <bleep to kick"" for the Gulf oil disaster. Start with Earl Pomeroy and the Democrats.
\
Democrats are responsible for BP drilling in 5,000 feet of water rather than in places like Alaska or shallow water where these leaks are quickly fixed and not noticed. Because of the votes of Democrats like Pomeroy, companies must drill where leaks are nearly impossible to cap.
\
Most everything in your home is made of petroleum including rubber, plastic, polyester and products too numerous to list. It powers our cars, fuels capitalism and fuels our economy.
\
It gives you the freedom to be independent rather than required to rely on the bare minimum that government would otherwise provide for you in a socialist society (when and if there is enough to go around).
\
Democrats hate economic freedom, that's why they hate oil.
\
Mankind has yet to produce a wind mill that can produce rubber, plastic or polyester, let alone produce more energy than it takes to construct and maintain it. If we would cease all oil production and refinement today, you would soon be wondering where your next meal is coming from.
\
We need oil for our survival, that's a fact of life.
\
Democrats limit our oil supply because that weakens our economy, destroys jobs and gives them more political power.
\
Democrats are already using the disaster that they created to limit our oil supplies further and to try to pass the cap and trade tax.
\
Forget the high gasoline prices that Pomeroy is already subjecting us to; our eco-friendly energy policy is an environmental catastrophe. We must drill where Democrats like Pomeroy will not permit us to drill to remain a free and prosperous people.
\
We must do it for our children and the environment.

North Dakota's attorney general said he expects the state to sue Minnesota over a plan there to tax carbon created by electrical generation.
\
After discussing the issue with the state Industrial Commission in a closed session this month, Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem said ""It is very likely that we will be suing the state of Minnesota,"" he said.
\
At issue is a measure by Minnesota's Public Utilities Commission to add a fee of between $4 and $34 per ton of carbon dioxide to the cost of electrical generation starting in 2012. The majority of electricity in North Dakota is generated by coal-fired power plants, which emit a large amount of carbon relative to other fuels sources. North Dakota officials argue that the move would place an unfair tax on electricity from the state and discourage its use by Minnesota utilities.
\
Stenehjem said possible legal action would relate to constitutional protections against restrictions on commerce between states.
\
The North Dakota Legislature in 2007 allocated $500,000 for litigation on the carbon tax proposal, and the Industrial Commission has protested the plan more than once since then. Stenehjem said that he and other officials have met with the Minnesota governor and attorney general and North Dakota officials have exhausted other means of resolving the dispute.

Besides their argument that Minnesota's move is an illegal attempt to regulate utilities outside of that state, Stenehjem said the plan does not take into account technology here to limit carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants by capturing carbon dioxide or converting coal to cleaner burner forms.

Carbon dioxide produced by the burning of coal and other fossil fuels has been blamed for global warming.

North Dakota's attorney general said he expects the state to sue Minnesota over a plan there to tax carbon created by electrical generation.
\
After discussing the issue with the state Industrial Commission in a closed session this month, Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem said ""It is very likely that we will be suing the state of Minnesota,"" he said.
\
At issue is a measure by Minnesota's Public Utilities Commission to add a fee of between $4 and $34 per ton of carbon dioxide to the cost of electrical generation starting in 2012. The majority of electricity in North Dakota is generated by coal-fired power plants, which emit a large amount of carbon relative to other fuels sources. North Dakota officials argue that the move would place an unfair tax on electricity from the state and discourage its use by Minnesota utilities.
\
Stenehjem said possible legal action would relate to constitutional protections against restrictions on commerce between states.
\
The North Dakota Legislature in 2007 allocated $500,000 for litigation on the carbon tax proposal, and the Industrial Commission has protested the plan more than once since then. Stenehjem said that he and other officials have met with the Minnesota governor and attorney general and North Dakota officials have exhausted other means of resolving the dispute. He said that a venue or a timeframe has not been chosen for litigation.

Recently, Lloyd Omdahl wrote a column on why North Dakota ""won't buy warming."" As a chamber president in a community with a stake in the global warming debate, and as a member of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Energy and Environment Committee, I wanted to follow up on Omdahl's column and suggest how we begin to discuss this policy issue.
\
At a recent meeting in Washington with the U.S. chamber and the seven CEOs of the national trade associations related to energy, there was agreement around the table that global warming is occurring. What is less clear is the debate between naturally occurring temperature change and the role of human impact on this change. However, that's a debate for another day.
\
At this point, most believe that something is going to occur from a national legislative standpoint. In North Dakota, we have a role to play in this debate. As Omdahl indicated, the lignite energy industry provides 4,000 jobs and is a $2 billion dollar industry. The principles by which we engage in this debate will impact not only business and industry, but our state residents as well. To guide us in this discussion, our state should generate a series of principles by which to screen global warming policy.
\
The first principle is the recognition that this is a global issue. Global warming cannot be legislated at the local, state or regional level. That is why Minnesota legislation to cap CO2 levels via a state mechanism is a bad idea. If every state or region has a different mandate or standard, it will only serve to create broad confusion. One state pitting itself against another is not in the best interest of a solution or this country.
\
There is a second industrial revolution occurring in the world, involving China and India. China is putting online one 500 megawatt coal plant a week without the strict environmental review or regulation that is found in the West. China's view is that global warming is an industrialized nation issue. While it is up to America to be a leader, without international cooperation, our solutions will be limited or useless in scope.
\
Another part of the idea regarding a cap on CO2 limits or a carbon tax lies with the idea of carbon sequestration. Without a doubt, this is a technology of the future. In fact, the Energy and Environmental Research Center in Grand Forks is one of the leaders with the Plains CO2 Reduction Partnership. Gasification technology to capture and sequester CO2 exists today at the Great Plains Synfuel Plant near Beulah, where approximately 8,000 tons of CO2 is captured and sequestered a day in Canadian oil fields.
\
However, capture technology is not available commercially for traditional power plants. This will require substantial technology development programs and funding to bring it to a point where it is commercially available, affordable and deployable in the next decade
\
A second principle will require national buy-in. It's not just about the coal or oil industry or asking corporations or business to sacrifice. Any solution will have to be applied across the board globally and include all economic sectors. Yes, that means our automobiles and tractors will be included, and the price of motor fuels will be affected.
\
A third principle is that, as a nation, we will require a mix of fuels to manage CO2 emissions and to achieve energy independence and national security. America currently relies on coal for more than 50 percent of its energy generation, and there is in excess of 250 billion tons of recoverable coals in America. Some of this coal will be used for today's technology and some for next generation ideas, such as the coal-to-liquid fuels plant that is under discussion.
\
However, to be really effective, this nation must not only develop its oil and coal reserves. We must also look to our renewable energy sources and, more than likely, some new development of nuclear energy. If we are really serious about this debate, new nuclear plants will have to be located somewhere in America. Technology development in all energy sectors is critical to our energy future. It's just a fact.
\
A fourth and final principle is that displacement of local and state economies must be accounted for as we engage policy into action. Yes, North Dakota and this nation are dependent upon coal, and coal generates salaries and wealth in this state. There is no way around it, and we should not apologize.
\
In closing, let's give credit where it is due. Already, this state is working toward clean technology through the Lignite Energy Council and the Energy and Environmental Research Center in Grand Forks. Our companies are leading the way in discussions about renewable fuels, coal to liquid fuels, implementing their own green policies and seeking ways to improve energy efficiency.
\
As the discussion on global warming is engaged, it is imperative that a baseline of guiding principles is created by which we determine acceptable policies for this community, state and nation.

When our companies formed an alliance to more than double the electrical output from the Big Stone Power Station, our goal was to provide for the growing energy needs of our customers in a manner that was both financially prudent and sensitive to our environment.
\
We believe that our country cannot achieve energy independence without expanding our ability to produce electric power. As we turn away from foreign-produced energy supplies, our reliance on a dependable domestic supply of electricity will increase.
\
We are committed to addressing that need in a manner that both protects our customers from excessive costs and minimizes the power plant's environmental impact.
\
The seven utilities involved in the Big Stone II project have readily agreed to spend an extra $59 million to not only clean the emissions from the new plant but to also reduce emissions at the existing plant. When this project is completed, the two plants combined will generate fewer emissions, mercury included, than the existing plant does today.
\
Moreover, we have invested in cutting-edge proven technology that will enable us to get the maximum amount of generation from a ton of coal. Because of our investments, the new plant will emit 18 percent less carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere than other existing plants in the region.
\
Additionally, we are upgrading an existing transmission line from Milbank, S.D., to Granite Falls, Minn., to 345 kV to not only transmit power from the Big Stone Power Station to our customers but to stimulate the development of hundreds of megawatts of wind- generated power in southwest Minnesota and North Dakota and South Dakota. While wind's intermittent nature does not allow it to be relied on as a base load resource, those hundreds of megawatts of wind will produce additional electricity with no CO2 emissions.
\
Finally, we have developed a plan to supply cement manufacturers with fly ash from the plant. While the sale of fly ash will not reduce our carbon dioxide emissions, it will reduce those of cement manufacturers. More than a ton of carbon dioxide is discharged into the atmosphere for each ton of cement that is manufactured.
\
In spite of our extra efforts, the project has attracted a cadre of critics who insist that coal - an abundant, available, price- stable fuel - should not be used to generate electricity. We disagree with their assertion that our plans for expanding the Big Stone Power Station be governed by a ""carbon tax"" that Congress may or may not enact at some future date.
\
The Big Stone expansion project strikes a balance between needs of the environment and energy needs of our customers. The seven utilities involved in building Big Stone II are trying to address a looming energy crisis in a way that is sensitive to the environment and not overly burdensome for our ratepayers.

\
WASHINGTON - ""Fervently"" is how America will henceforth engage in talks on global warming. So said the president's climate change negotiator Sunday in Germany, at a U.N. conference on reducing carbon emissions. This vow was fervently applauded by conferees welcoming the end of what AP's news story called the Bush administration's ""eight years of obdurate participation"" in climate talks.
\
Reducing carbon emissions supposedly will reverse warming, if it resumes after the current period without warming, a period that began, according to statistics published by the World Meteorological Organization, 11 years ago. Regarding the reversing, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change has many ambitions, as outlined in a working group's 16-page ""information note"" to ""facilitate discussions."" For example:
\
""Tariffs can be lowered to grant special preference to climate-friendly goods, or they can be maintained at high levels to discourage trade in GHG (greenhouse gas)-intensive goods and services."" The working group says protectionism ""in the service of climate change objectives"" might virtuously ""shelter domestic producers of climate-friendly goods.""
\
Furthermore, using ""border carbon adjustment,"" a nation might virtuously ""impose costs on imports equivalent to that (sic) faced by domestic producers"" operating under a carbon tax. Or a nation with a cap-and-trade regime regulating carbon emissions by domestic manufacturers might require foreign manufacturers ""to buy offsets at the border equal to that (sic) which the producer would have been forced to purchase had the good been produced domestically.""
\
Cynics will see only potential for mischief by governments, including the U.S. government, using such measures to give a green patina to protectionism. Meanwhile, the U.S. government is having its own problems with one ""climate-friendly good"" that might not be. Last week, The New York Times front page carried this headline: ""The Bulb That Saved the Planet May Be a Little Less Than Billed.""
\
The story recounted some Americans' misadventures with the new light bulbs that almost all Americans - all but those who are filling their closets with supplies of today's incandescent bulbs - will have to use after the phaseout of today's bulbs in 2014. (You missed that provision of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007?)
\
A San Francisco - naturally - couple emerged from Al Gore's movie ""An Inconvenient Truth"" incandescent with desire to think globally and act locally, in their home. So they replaced their incandescent bulbs with the compact fluorescents that Congress says must soon be ubiquitous. ""Instead of having a satisfying green moment, however,"" the Times reported, ""they wound up coping with a mess.""
\
Although supposed to last 10,000 hours and save, the Times says, ""as much as"" $5.40 a year in electricity costs, some bulbs died within a few hours. Some experts, reports the Times, ""blame the government for the quality problems,"" saying its push to cut the bulbs' prices prompted manufacturers to use inferior components.
\
Furthermore, some experts have written a guide saying the new bulbs require ""a little insight and planning."" The Times says that ""may be an understatement.""
\
The bulbs, says the Times, ""do not do well in hot places with little airflow, like recessed ceiling fixtures,"" and some do not work ""with dimmers or three-way sockets."" And: ""Be aware that compact fluorescents can take one to three minutes to reach full brightness. This is not a defect."" Well, if you say so. Because all fluorescents contain mercury, a toxic metal, they must never be put in the trash, so Home Depot and other chains offer bins for disposing of dangerous bulbs. Driving to one of these disposal points might not entirely nullify the bulbs' environmental benefits. Besides, the Times summarizes the Environmental Protection Agency's helpful suggestions for coping with the environmental dangers caused when one of these environment-saving bulbs breaks:
\
""Clear people and pets from the room and open a window for at least 15 minutes if possible. Avoid vacuuming. Scoop up larger pieces with stiff paper or cardboard, pick up smaller residue with sticky tape, and wipe the area with a damp cloth. Put everything into a sealed plastic bag or sealed glass jar. In most cases, this can be put in the trash, but the EPA recommends checking local rules.""
\
Worrywarts wonder what will happen when a lazy or careless, say, 10 percent of 300 million Americans put their worn-out bulbs in the trash. Stop worrying. What do you think? That Congress, architect of the ethanol industry and designer of automobiles, does not think things through?

Nothing sacred
\
about marriage
\
For whatever reason, many people in this city actually believe that marriage in today's society is sacred. They really do believe this. I just wonder what could make these people so hopelessly delusional as to believe such a thing. They use this ""knowledge"" to argue that homosexual men and women should not be able to legally marry each other.
\
Perhaps marriage was originally sacred, and possibly for some time thereafter, but today? Not with a divorce rate of roughly 50 percent.
\
""Till death do us part"" is apparently an insignificant detail to some. Some couples could just decide the fate of their marriage by a coin toss. Is this sacred?
\
These homosexual men and women are not ""ripping apart the moral fabric of our nation."" After all, heterosexuals have already been there and done that. And just because a reverend writes a letter to this paper, claiming that homosexuality is wrong and marriage is under attack, that doesn't mean the words are taken verbatim from the mouth of God.
\
These men and women, these human beings, should be treated as such. That means they should be given the same benefits and rights that a straight couple is given.
\
It deeply troubles me, a young man of only 18, that the adults in my society are trying, and sometimes honestly believing, that what they fight for is for me, that they speak for my benefit and are holding my values.

When U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar visits North Dakota on Saturday, he should get the message on lignite coal: If America wants to remain a world economic leader, it needs to continue to invest in clean coal research and make a reasoned, economically prudent shift to new technologies and lower emissions of greenhouse gases.
\
The tide, however, seems to be going the other direction, at least in popular opinion in urban areas on the nation's coasts and among environmental groups and their lobbyists.
\
North Dakota's coal-fired energy industry faces a challenge: the possibility of a federal cap and trade strategy as a way to limit CO2 emissions.
\
Secretary Salazar's visit comes on the heels of the North Dakota Public Service Commission's summit on the impact of cap and trade on the state's energy industry, during which red flags were raised by coal country's community officials and industry leaders.
\
On the surface, it's a science issue and a health issue. Global warming, it is claimed, could cook the planet. But at its core, it's about politics, and a ground swell of American public opinion calling for immediate action to reduce the nation's carbon footprint. Many pro-green people want a tax on carbon, more specifically coal, or cap and trade. They want it now. And they are increasingly convinced that there can be no such thing as clean coal.
\
Nor does it matter to them that coal-fired plants have made huge strides in reducing emission, and are now only slowed at the task by the need to develop new and practical technologies to further scrub what goes up the stacks. It makes no difference that wind, solar and nuclear energy are not ready to step into coal's harness to pull the nation's energy load. And it apparently does not matter that people will pay the price for this kind of shortsighted federal action when they pay heating and cooling bills, and when the price of goods and services goes up to cover energy costs for business and industry.
\
When it comes to coal and a healthy environment, given practical economic and scientific limitations, it cannot be one or the other. It must be, as always, in that gray area between. We need to take care of the planet. We need to have environmentally sound practices and be more energy efficient. Emissions must be slowed. New advances in clean coal technology will become more practical and cost effective. And we must produce enough energy to meet demand at a price people can afford.
\
The message to Secretary Salazar: America needs a national energy policy that provides balance between traditional and alternative sources of energy aimed at energy self-sufficiency. And any carbon tax or cap and trade strategy needs to not punish people and the industry, but provide incentives for cleaner energy production, whether it be wind, solar, nuclear, oil, gas or coal driven.
\
Timing is everything.
"
46,"WASHINGTON - Republicans long divided over the scale, scope and science of climate change are unifying behind legislation geared toward a constituency they cannot afford to lose: young conservative voters.\Their efforts to reach this key group for the 2020 election are rapidly accelerating.\Within the course of a month, a little-known initiative to plant a trillion trees worldwide has attracted the attention and endorsement of President Donald Trump, who touted the concept at the World Economic Forum in Davos and during the State of the Union address to Congress.\House Republican leaders are now building on the momentum to produce legislation from this proposal, which calls for private-public partnerships to plant a trillion trees around the world in an effort to capture harmful carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere.\While this is not the only component of the new House GOP climate platform - the plan also doubles down on ""carbon capture"" technology, which would capture fossil fuel emissions before they can reach the atmosphere - it is the clearest example yet of an emerging Republican strategy to propose low-cost, high-reward political fixes on climate change.\It allows Trump and Republican lawmakers to appeal to young and old conservatives alike - those who fear the effects of climate change and those concerned that federal regulations meant to curb emissions, as frequently proposed by Democrats, will hamper the economy.\""The trees - it's a simple and beautiful thing,"" said Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, a supporter of the proposal. ""Nothing takes CO2 more out of the air than a tree does.""\Trump's shift on the issue of climate change, which is now being replicated by a growing number of Republicans on Capitol Hill, began in earnest in 2018, when his senior advisers debated whether to create a panel that would challenge the basic science fueling fears of a warming Earth.\The president's closest confidants - including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, his daughter and son-in-law - warned of political repercussions to his continued denial of climate change and the government's role in fighting it, according to one former National Security Council official.\This precipitated a series of private surveys that showed increasing concern among young Republicans with the effects that climate change will have across the country's coasts and plains.\In December, 25 presidents of statewide college Republican groups formed an advocacy organization to lobby Congress for conservative solutions to the climate crisis, after the College Republican National Committee proposed an anti-carbon tax resolution at their annual Thanksgiving meeting.\Whit Ayres, a veteran Republican pollster who has consulted Republican senators and governors for over three decades, characterized the party's shift toward recognition of climate change as an ""evolution"" similar to the Democrats' movement in the 2010s toward support for gay marriage. At that time, polls showed the issue split along an unusually stark generational line.\""It's been pretty clear for some time that more and more people are concerned about climate change,"" Ayres said. ""In some ways it's like gay marriage - age is not usually a particular issue, but it certainly is the case with climate change, as it was with gay marriage. There's a strong relationship where the younger the voter, the greater the concern.""\For retiring Republican Rep. Francis Rooney of Florida, who has long urged his party to be more aggressive on this issue, it's obvious why Republicans are acting now, with a decisive presidential election just months away and a concerted effort to retake control of the House.\""I think it's evidence they realize the world we live in now, with younger voters, suburban voters that are at risk under recent elections, that climate is a very important issue to them,"" Rooney said. ""The polling's very clear.""\Fellow Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, who drafted a resolution last year echoing Democratic talking points that climate change is a threat to national security, agreed.\""I am encouraged that my Republican colleagues are abandoning climate denial,"" he said.\House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who is close with Trump, confirmed that he had spoken to the administration about the series of proposals he and his members will be rolling out in the weeks and months ahead.\His approach mirrors fresh talking points from the White House, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Trump campaign, all of which told McClatchy that the president has adopted the small-government policy recognizing the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\""The Trump administration's policies are proof you can have a strong, growing economy while preserving a healthy environment for generations to come,"" said Sarah Matthews, deputy press secretary for the Trump campaign, who noted a decline in U.S. emissions from 2016 to 2018.\Yet Republicans involved in crafting the new environmental platform on Capitol Hill denied they were acting now out of a sense of acute anxiety about their political fortunes in November.\""Someone asked me this yesterday, 'why now?' It's not 'why now,' we have been doing it,"" said McCarthy in an interview, mentioning the recent enactment of a newly enhanced tax incentive for carbon capture, utilization and storage - an initiative pushed by Republicans.\Asked specifically whether Republicans needed to be more aggressive in pitching their environmental policies to voters, McCarthy said simply, ""Republicans can do a better job on all the issues and that's why we continue improvement.""\CREDIT: MICHAEL WILNER AND EMMA DUMAIN Tribune News Service"

Republican Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem faces Democrat Jeanette Boechler, a Fargo-based attorney, in this year's attorney general race.
\
Stenehjem was first elected to the office in 2000 and was re-elected in 2004 and 2006. Boechler, a political newcomer originally from Minot, has long represented people with injuries related to exposure to asbestos.
\
Federal legislation
\
Boechler said the role of the attorney general is to follow the law of the land - whether that be federal law or North Dakota law - and ""to try to do that without a personal perspective opinion on what that law should be or shouldn't be.""
\
Boechler said she disagreed with Stenehjem's decision to join the Florida-led lawsuit against the new health care act. She said the lawsuit is without merit and pointed to a number of legal scholars in agreement.
\
""The lawsuit is not well founded in legal principle,"" Boechler said. ""Generally, if something is not unconstitutional, there really isn't a basis to challenge it.""
\
Stenehjem said he views his role in the judicial system as an important part of the balance of power among the branches of government.
\
""You have to check the abuses or excesses that might logically or illogically be reached by another branch,"" Stenehjem said.
\
He said there are numerous times other than the health care law in which he has challenged the federal government, pointing to a lawsuit under the Bush administration dealing with the do-not-call registry.
\
Stenehjem said the federal government's mandate that individuals buy health insurance is a ""total stretch of the commerce clause"" that he worries could open the door to future abuses.
\
Adam Walsh Act
\
North Dakota is largely in compliance with the federal act that creates a national sex offender registry, but by not being fully compliant the state loses about $78,000 from a federal grant. Stenehjem contends that North Dakota's sex offender laws keep citizens safer than the national one.
\
""I think it's an important issue to be in compliance,"" Boechler said. ""Perhaps our law is better, but not being able to have the benefit of what's happening nationally,"" she said, causes her to question whether not being in compliance is really a benefit in the long term.
\
Stenehjem said a national system to track sex offenders is certainly in North Dakota's interest, and the national law would cover the Indian reservations that the state law cannot.
\
His concern lies in the way the federal system classifies the risk of sexual offenders to repeat the crime. Stenehjem said the national system would only look at the crime committed, which is often pleaded down by sex offenders. He prefers North Dakota's system, which takes into account the crime, what kind of treatment sex offenders are getting and if they have a permanent residence - all factors he said are much better signals of recidivism.
\
Stenehjem said the state has until July 2011 to comply. He's hoping North Dakota can show its system is better before then.
\
Minnesota carbon tax
\
Stenehjem said he's continuing to work with Minnesotans to try to get them to overturn a law he says unfairly taxes North Dakota coal going into Minnesota.
\
Starting in 2012, Minnesota's law will add a per-ton fee to carbon dioxide created during electrical generation, something Stenehjem says violates the commerce clause of the Constitution.
\
He's met with the state's governor and legislators but has more recently turned to working with leaders of Minnesota's rural electric cooperatives, saying they will have more pull.
\
""I reminded them (the RECs) this is election time. Let your elected officials know how you feel,"" he said.
\
Stenehjem said the offer is still on the table for their legislators to visit North Dakota's energy sector, but if the law isn't overturned soon, he will file a lawsuit.
\
""I'm not sure when we'll have to sue. That's a strategic decision that has to be made,"" Stenehjem said.
\
Boechler said it would be irresponsible to offer a legal opinion without being privy to all the facts of the case that Stenehjem is, but said she understands the balancing act of promoting North Dakota's energy industry and looking out for the environment.
\
24/7 Sobriety
\
The 24/7 Sobriety Program requires those with DUIs to get tested twice daily to ensure they have not been drinking. Stenehjem said the success of the program has him pondering opening it up to juveniles.
\
Boechler said it's an effective program, but she would be opposed to opening it up to those younger than 18 because she believes juvenile courts are best equipped to handle those cases.
\
""Having a separate juveniles system for dealing with minors comes with some discretion for individual circumstances,"" she said. ""That discretion is an important part of the system designed to treat and protect minors as opposed to punishing.""
\
Stenehjem said the idea ""is in the preliminary thought stages of my mind"" and doesn't want to push the program too far too fast. Still, he said, he hasn't dismissed the idea of opening it to those younger than 18 along with those between 18 and 20.
\
He called teen alcohol abuse a major problem.
\
""We have to do something about it. We have to do more than we're already doing,"" Stenehjem said.
\
He said the program could be designed to put children into 24/7 Sobriety either before or after their conviction.
\
NAWS
\
Stenehjem said the efforts to draw and treat water from the Missouri River for use in nearby counties are largely being settled. The project is known as the Northwest Area Water Supply project.
\
Stenehjem said with a study under way, the outcome might mean more litigation is necessary, depending on what conclusion it reaches and what standards North Dakota would have to meet to make Canada comfortable.
\
Boechler said she did not know enough of the overall facts as to the duties of the attorney general to respond to questions about that case.

48,"WASHINGTON - Republicans greeted climate legislation from their Democratic peers with a cold embrace, calling it a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach. Nevertheless, some elements of the bill have a shot at bipartisan support, including electricity standards, carbon-trapping technology, toxic chemicals, a diesel emissions program and controls on methane.\The bill, which Energy and Commerce Committee Democrats introduced last week, sets national targets to slash greenhouse gas emissions at least 50% by 2030, down from 2005 levels, and reach net-zero emissions by mid-century.\Its central element, a policy known as a ""clean electricity standard,"" would require utility companies nationwide to generate a rising percentage of their electricity from zero-emissions sources, hitting 80% by 2030 and 100% by 2035.\The bill is the first piece of broad climate legislation to be introduced in the 117th Congress and contains elements likely to be rolled into a broader climate-and-infrastructure bill.\""We're beginning to see actual legislative language being put together to enact the Biden legislative agenda,"" Lindsey Walter, deputy director for the climate and energy program at Third Way, a centrist think tank, said in an interview.\While ranking member Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., and Reps. Fred Upton, R-Mich., and David McKinley, R-W.V., swiftly rebuked the legislation as a ""rush to green with one-size-fits-all regulations,"" the members said they were open to working on specific provisions addressing innovation, nuclear power and hydroelectricity.\Recent legislation from committee Republicans also hint at areas of potential bipartisan support within the bill, though it appears unlikely the legislation would get much if any GOP backing in its present form.\McKinley and Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., introduced legislation in December to establish a clean electricity standard with the goal of cutting 80% of greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector by 2050.\That target is not as aggressive as the bill Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., introduced last Congress. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the business lobbying and advocacy group, backed the McKinley-Schrader legislation last year.\Nearly three-quarters of states had adopted voluntary or compulsory electricity standards as of early 2019, according to researchers with Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan organization.\""The idea of a national clean energy standard is not new, and the concept has received bipartisan support,"" the researchers wrote, noting that Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., sponsored CES legislation in 2010 that aimed for generating 50% of U.S. electricity with clean sources by 2050.\The Democrats' bill this Congress includes other topics that draw bipartisan interest.\It includes $5 million for fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2026 for the injection and sequestration of carbon dioxide emissions into deep rock formations. Carbon capture technology has strong support from oil- and coal-state members of both parties, including Sen. Joe Manchin III, D-W.V., the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and his GOP counterpart on the panel, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo.\The bill also reauthorizes $500 million annually for fiscal 2022 through 2031, for a federal grant program at the EPA to help states reduce emissions from diesel vehicles.\""It is a voluntary program, administered by the EPA, that helps fund the retrofit or replacement of existing heavy-duty diesel vehicles, engines, and equipment with cleaner diesel or new technology,"" Upton said Sept. 9, 2019, on the House floor in support of the program. ""The federal and state grants and other assistance under this program resulted in cleaner, more efficient vehicles, and the net effect is cleaner air in cities and communities that, in fact, need it the most.""\And last year, Upton introduced a bill to reduce methane emissions from burning off natural gas at drilling and processing sites, a practice known as flaring.\Methane is more than 80 times more potent to the climate than carbon dioxide. EPA weakened methane regulation in August 2019 to mixed reaction from the oil and gas industry.\Oil-and-gas giants Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell PLC, BP PLC and Equinor are broadly in favor of limiting methane gas releases through flaring.\The House bill also carves out a new grant program at EPA to provide funding for water utilities to address contamination from perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances - better known as PFAS, the near-ubiquitous chemicals found in myriad consumer goods - and authorizes funding for that program at $500 million for fiscal 2022 through 2031.\A rare environmental issue that has bipartisan urgency, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.V., the top Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has made PFAS a focus early this Congress as have dozens of Democrats in both chambers.\At a subcommittee hearing last summer, Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., an Energy and Commerce panel member, called the presence of PFAS contamination across Michigan ""alarming.""\""The number of PFAS-confirmed sites has grown rapidly over the last few years, my district included, and Michiganians are seriously concerned,"" he said.\CREDIT: BENJAMIN J.

Lets raise the gas tax. There are several reasons we need to discuss this now. One is that plummeting gasoline prices make the idea very timely. Also, people will be asking you what you thought of President Barack Obamas State of the Union address. Even though he did not mention the gas tax, bringing it up will allow you to avoid having an opinion on whether its time to close the capital gains stepped-up-basis loophole. The gas tax raises much-needed money for roads and mass transit. Our roads, you may have noticed, are falling apart. Every time you hit a pothole, yell: Raise the gas tax! Even more important, it encourages Americans to use fuel-efficient cars. While were all happy as clams about falling gas prices, every gallon produces more than 19 pounds of planet-warming emissions. We just had the hottest year on record. The ice floes are melting. Walruses keep piling up along the Alaskan shore, where the babies can get squashed. Raise the gas tax and remember the walruses. Plus, its not really a tax, Or at least not necessarily. Just ask Ronald Reagan. When he entered office, Reagan said he didnt see the likelihood of a gas tax increase unless theres a palace coup. But then, you know, stuff happened and The Great Communicator discovered that a levy on gasoline wasnt really a tax but merely a user fee. So no problem at all, and under his administration the, um, fee was more than doubled. Ah, Ronald Reagan. Perhaps you noticed, during the State of the Union, that Obama was urging Congress to bring the capital gains tax back up to Reagan-era levels? Whod have thought? We live in ironic times, people. But about the gas tax. It was also raised under George H.W. (The Good One) Bush, and then again under Bill Clinton. Remember Al Gore breaking the tie in the Senate? Ah, Al Gore. And that was it. The federal gas tax, currently 18.4 cents a gallon, is not indexed for inflation and has not gone up since 1993. The Highway Trust Fund, which pays for the federal highway construction program, keeps falling deeper into the red. Its scheduled to implode sometime this spring. The White House has been very clear about its lack of enthusiasm for solving the problem with a gas tax increase. Mainly, the objection is that if Congress wouldnt pass Obamas proposal to pay for early education with a tobacco tax, its not going to fund road repair with a gas tax. This is a pretty good point. However, deeply cynical souls could also argue that the current majority likes road construction more than preschool. During the State of the Union, Obama made his pitch for another idea: reform the tax on overseas business profits, creating a one-time-only windfall of revenue for the government to use in a mega-road-building spree. Three reasons the gas tax is a better idea: 1) Walruses. 2) Half the members of Congress are eyeing that very same windfall to pay for their own pet programs. 3) Only works once. Its just a cowards way out, said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. Genuine fiscal conservatives hate the idea of paying for permanent ongoing programs with one-shot revenues. Corker has been known to complain that hes been in the Senate for eight years and never saw Congress permanently solve a problem. Last year, Corker and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., floated the idea of raising the gas tax 12 cents over two years. Our bet when we went out on a limb last year was that we could position it as a topic for serious discussion this year, and I hope its going to pay off, Murphy said. And its working, sort of. A number of prominent Republicans have been muttering things like nothing is off the table. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., the new chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and a man whose position on global warming makes him an enemy to walruses everywhere, has said a gas tax is one of the options. An option that is not off the table. Truly, the worm has turned. On the other hand, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the new chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, recently announced: We wont pass a gas tax. That would seem to be somewhat discouraging, but there are still these gleams of hope that Republicans might come around since: You can call it a user fee. (Ask Reagan) Obama doesnt like it. Compromise is possible. Many conservatives hate the fact that the Highway Trust Fund also helps support mass transit and invests in things like highway beautification and bike paths. There might be some room for give here. Lets throw something in the fund under the proverbial bus. I nominate transportation museums. Walrus seconds the motion.(Gail Collins writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.)

(The following editorial appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer on Wednesday, June 11.)
\
It's frustrating enough when gas prices soar due to the unseen forces of global supply and demand. But it's downright unfair when Wall Street speculators contribute to rising prices at the pump.
\
There's growing evidence that investors looking to make a fast buck are causing oil prices to rise faster than can be explained by ordinary market forces.
\
Congress, however, can do something about the situation. It can help to ease this problem, because it helped to create this monster.
\
In December 2000, Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which was signed into law by President Clinton just before he left office in January 2001.
\
Few people realized at the time that a loophole had been tucked into this 262-page bill at the last minute by then-Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. It came to be known as the ""Enron Loophole,"" and it allowed Enron and other large energy traders to be exempt from federal oversight of over-the-counter transactions in energy markets.
\
Enron is no more, but the loophole lives on. It has allowed massive growth of unregulated trading on energy futures markets, where investors essentially ""bet"" on the price of oil at a certain date in the future.
\
Commodities markets ordinarily allow commercial buyers of goods that people need, such as corn, pork and energy products, to lock in a price for later delivery of those commodities. But in the unregulated environment spawned by the Enron Loophole, speculators increasingly treat commodities as if they were stocks. These investors don't want to take delivery of the oil after they ""buy"" it; they just want the price to rise so they can make a huge profit. As the dollar weakens, oil becomes an even more attractive investment.
\
The details of these types of trades are largely hidden. Some contracts are negotiated between parties who don't need to disclose them. Some contracts are made overseas, beyond the limited oversight of U.S. regulators.
\
As speculators flock to oil, they are creating artificial demand for the commodity, which drives up the price. Nobody knows how much speculators are adding to the cost of gasoline, but some analysts believe it's as much as 50 percent of recent increases.
\
Other factors are probably contributing to $4 gasoline. Global oil supply has not increased, and there is growing demand from nations such as China and India. But many experts believe that speculating is also adding considerably to the rapid price increase at the pump.
\
Meanwhile the federal authority responsible for regulating such trading, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is virtually powerless to step in. The CFTC needs the regulatory authority and the staffing to make sure these markets are transparent and monitored. Congress should give this weakened agency the tools it needs to do its oversight job effectively.
\
The presumptive presidential nominees, Sens. Barack Obama, D-Ill., and John McCain, R-Ariz., haven't paid notice to this factor in rising gas prices. Both candidates have chosen to pander to voters with politically popular ploys - McCain with a gas-tax ""holiday"" and Obama with a windfall profits tax on oil companies. Neither idea will likely affect prices at the pump in a meaningful way.
\
Instead, lawmakers should close the loophole that gave rise to heightened market speculation. Commodities are products that consumers need for their daily existence, and those markets shouldn't be so vulnerable to greedy manipulation. Oil trading: The speculators' cut

LAS VEGAS - The Hoover Dam, one of the world's great engineering feats, is marred by roads with traffic so jammed along the Nevada-Arizona border that it tells a different story about the political will to maintain 21st century infrastructure.
\
The road leading to the dam cannot accommodate the torrent of tourists and spills them into the overwhelmed little town of Boulder City. Nevada lawmakers are trying to find a private company to build a $400 million bypass because the state can't afford it.
\
The phrase ""you can't get there from here"" is increasingly apt nearly everywhere one turns. America's roads, highways, bridges and transit systems are falling apart. Even those not in disrepair are often so crowded that a horse and buggy might seem faster. Cities and suburbs are outgrowing their infrastructure far faster than local governments can find the money to fix them.
\
While the problem is plain to all, the money and the political will to fix it isn't there.
\
Two congressionally mandated commissions and a slew of experts and committees have said the nation needs to double, even quadruple, what it spends each year to maintain and repair its aging transportation infrastructure and expand to accommodate population growth.
\
So there's the rub. No one likes traffic jams and potholes. No one wants people to die because an unsafe bridge has collapsed. But raising federal gas and diesel taxes or boosting tolls and fees isn't popular, either.
\
Pew Center polls in the last year show that 67 percent of those questioned said their state should not cut money for roads and public transit to balance its budget. But only 38 percent want federal spending increased and only 27 percent favor an increase in the gas tax that often pays for it.
\
At the same time, three-quarters say more spending on roads, bridges and other public works would help create jobs.
\
""The American public has turned selfish. They don't really want to invest in this stuff,"" said Robert Atkinson, a technology think tank executive who helped lead one of the federal transportation commissions. ""It's akin to leaving your house to your kids when you die without fixing the roof because you wanted to spend the money instead on Florida vacations.""
\
In Delaware, officials have delayed dozens of capital projects, but still expected a $21 million shortfall in the state's transportation trust fund this summer. The deficit is seen as growing to $1 billion by 2016.
\
In Texas, a committee recently declared the highway system inadequate and warned lawmakers that congestion would worsen without money for road improvements. Gov. Rick Perry's plan for a toll road across the state was abandoned in the face of uproar from ranchers whose land would be seized to build it.
\
In Pennsylvania, 5,906 bridges, or about 27 percent of the state's total, are graded structurally deficient, the highest rate in the nation, according to the Washington-based policy group Transportation for America.
\
The emergency closure this month of the 50-year-old Sherman Minton Bridge, one of three spans that connect southern Indiana and Louisville, Ky., has snarled the daily commute for tens of thousands of motorists. Officials found cracks in the steel span, raising safety concerns. The two states have struggled for years to find the money to build two more bridges.
\
Maryland business leaders persuaded the governor and lawmakers to spend more on road construction after a state commission found nearly $1 billion in transportation dollars had been diverted to the general fund budget.
\
In Georgia, lawmakers approved legislation to allow 12 regions around the state to ask voters next year whether to raise their sales tax by a penny per dollar to pay for an approved list of transportation projects. Officials in the 10-county Atlanta region recently endorsed a $6.14 billion draft list of transportation projects, from light rail to new highways, to ease congestion that's among the worst in the nation.
\
The consequences of inaction are severe.
\
Atkinson's commission forecast ""unimaginable levels of congestion"" in the coming decades. Safety will be reduced. Goods and services will cost more. The quality of life will be eroded, and the nation's economic competitiveness diminished, the commission predicted.
\
The Federal Highway Administration predicts 40 percent of the nation's major highways will be congested by 2035 without fixes.
\
""Our highways are clogged with traffic. Our skies are the most congested in the world. This is inexcusable,"" President Barack Obama told Congress in a speech last week in which he demanded passage of a jobs bill.
\
""Building a world-class transportation system is part of what made us an economic superpower. And now we're going to sit back and watch China build newer airports and faster railroads? At a time when millions of unemployed construction workers could build them right here in America?""
\
Despite the sense of urgency, federal highway and transit programs that underwrite about 40 percent of transportation construction have been in a kind of legislative limbo for two years, limping along under a series of short-term extensions because Congress can't figure out how to pay for them.
\
Republicans want the programs to be funded almost entirely through existing transportation taxes, primarily the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax and 24.4 cents per gallon federal diesel tax. But revenue from the taxes is declining as people drive less and buy more fuel-efficient cars.
\
GOP Rep. John Mica of Florida, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has proposed a six-year, $230 billion plan that would slash annual transportation spending by about 30 percent.
\
Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, who heads the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has developed a plan that would last only two years and cost $109 billion. But it would maintain current spending levels with some adjustment for inflation.
\
Federal inaction is ""a big variable, right now,"" Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, said recently. ""You wouldn't have thought so because it's been routinely extended in the past, but some of these guys in Congress really do believe that bridges are like trees and if you leave them alone long enough they grow taller and stronger with age, so it's hard to say.""
\
At the state level, 21 states cut transportation money last year even with a $48.1 billion infusion of federal stimulus dollars for road projects, according to the National Conference of State Legislators. The proportion of spending on transportation at the state level has held steady at 9 percent since 1995.
\
""People need to understand all across America what's at stake,"" said Tony Dorsey of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.
\
Ed Garcia does.
\
The 24-year-old travels from Arizona to Nevada once a month to visit his girlfriend and often gets stuck in traffic near the Hoover Dam. The federal government last year opened a four-lane bypass that routed traffic from a bottleneck near the Hoover Dam to a new U.S. 93 bridge. But traffic remains severe west of the span, near where U.S. 93 connects with U.S. 95 in Boulder City.
\
""You sit in traffic for hours not moving,"" Garcia said. ""There's this one road that goes through town, and everyone is on it.""
\
State legislators aren't any more eager than members of Congress to raise their gas tax to fix roads. In Maryland, Delaware, Utah and Wyoming, lawmakers rejected gas tax increases to pay for new road work because, they said, residents couldn't afford higher taxes.
\
""If I got a pair of worn-out Levis, I don't go out and buy another pair just cause I need them,"" Republican state Sen. Chris Buttars of Utah said last spring as he argued against raising that state's gas tax by 5 cents per gallon. ""I've got to have the money.""
\
About two dozen states are making due with the same fuel tax they charged in 1996, according to the federal government. But in California, for example, inflation has eaten away half the value of that state's gas tax, which has remained at 18 cents per gallon since 1994.
\
In the absence of new revenue, states are borrowing their way to better roads, with bonds accounting for about one-third of state transportation money. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell recently won passage of a $4 billion transportation plan, more than half from bonds.
\
The spending needs are just to maintain roads from normal wear and tear and get ready for population growth.
\
Vermont has a whole new set of problems. One-third of the bridges in the state were rated structurally deficient or functionally obsolete by the FHA before Hurricane Irene inundated the state last month.
\
Weeks later, 18 state highway bridges remained closed and 200 miles of state roads were impassable, chewed away by brooks turned suddenly to torrents.
\
The biggest worry was getting critical links into mountain towns open before winter.
\
In the legislative session that ended in May, Vermont lawmakers approved $544 million in transportation spending. But no one thinks that will come close to accomplishing the items in the then-envisioned budget and restoring the state's roads after Irene. @Headline bold:States struggle for financing to meet road needs

The North Dakota Department of Transportation has saved about $80 million through lower bids for road projects this year, but the state's economic slowdown also has produced lower gas tax revenues that demand a ""very serious discussion"" about how to match federal funding, the agency's director said Thursday.
\
The department advertised an estimated $680 million worth of work and ended up with projects totaling about $580 million, which Director Grant Levi attributed to a competitive bidding environment and lower costs for fuel, asphalt and other construction materials.
\
""We had a savings of about 18 percent, which is phenomenal,"" he told the Legislature's interim Transportation Committee.
\
About $22 million also was cut from the DOT's road budget in February to help balance a $1.07 billion revenue shortfall.
\
Levi said the savings has allowed the DOT to do more about 180 projects are under way and even bid projects this fall for next spring.
\
But a decline in traffic has taken a bite out of motor fuels tax revenues. The DOT estimated about 480,000 vehicles were on the road daily in June, down about 20,000 from 2014 and 2015, while truck traffic this year has been closer to 2011 levels.
\
Levi said the country overall has experienced a decline in gas tax revenues because of greater fuel efficiency and fewer miles traveled.
\
""There's just less usage that's occurring,"" he said.
\
North Dakota's tax on both gasoline and diesel is 23 cents per gallon. Each penny of the tax generated $7.6 million in the fiscal year that just ended June 30 down from $8.7 million the previous year and is projected to drop to $7.4 million per year in the 2017-19 budget cycle.
\
Revenues were cushioned by increased traffic that accompanied the oil boom, but now that it's cooled off, the state is in a similar situation. Levi noted surrounding states have raised gas taxes to compensate. Minnesota's gasoline tax is 28.6 cents a gallon, Montana's is 27.75 cents a gallon and South Dakota approved a hike last year to 30 cents a gallon.
\
Lawmakers asked when North Dakota's gas tax was last increased and whether they'll need to take a hard look at it. Levi said the state last raised the tax in 2005 in order to match federal funding, and vehicle registration fees also haven't changed since 2007.
\
Asked if the DOT would push for a gas tax increase during next year's session, Levi told reporters ""those are policy discussions that need to occur"" among lawmakers.
\
""It's going to have to be a very serious discussion"" about how to match federal funds, he told the committee.

I was astounded to see Mayor Mike Seminarys comments several weeks back regarding growth in Bismarck and how it relates to taxation. In the Oct. 14 edition of the Tribune, Seminary was quoted as saying: ""I don't know how we stay in this growing environment and provide all that we provide in the city without raising some form of revenue. I believe sales tax is the fairest and most appropriate way. What Seminary is essentially saying is that the more Bismarck grows, the higher we can expect tax rates. That is a baffling and, quite frankly, infuriating perspective on how government should be managed. Why would anyone want Bismarck to grow if it means inevitably higher tax rates? The whole point of growing a city is to grow the tax base and spread the burden out so that everyone pays less, not more. Growth is good, but Seminary's world view that the purpose of growth is to charge higher tax rates is simply not a philosophy that we should accept from any elected official. More recently, at the Dec. 22 city commission meeting, as reported by the Bismarck Tribune, the mayor is readying a campaign based on fear and scare tactics designed to extort certain interest groups into supporting his sales tax increase. Seminary tasked the city staff in developing all sorts of other ways to hit citizens and businesses with higher user fees and taxes to pay for the most basic thing local government does. One of these scare scenarios is to hit developers with $30,000 lot fees for every new lot brought online that would be a sure way to stop all growth and create a lot shortage in Bismarck. Another is to have the city of Bismarck apply a 72-cent to 98-cent gas tax to every gallon of gas. Since the state has not explicitly granted cities the power to apply such a tax, this is an idea designed to terrorize consumers into supporting a 1-cent sales tax. Yet another threat is to add $68 per month to utility bills. This is another red herring because water and sewer user fees charged by the city are used to pay bonded debt for water and sewer. It would be very unusual for a city to try to use utility bill revenue to finance road project bonds. Certainly the bond underwriters would question that approach, and it would definitely be open to a lawsuit by citizens. If the only way Seminary can promote his sales tax increase is by terrorizing citizens with fictional ways the city can hurt them if they do not support the sales tax, he should reconsider his reasoning.(Dwight Wrangham has been a Bismarck businessman for 35 years. He served 12 years in the Legislature as a representative and served on House Finance and Taxation, Political Subdivision, Judicial, Agriculture and Administrative Rules committees.)

Frustration. In one word, that expresses my experience with Higher Education as I end my first three weeks on the Education and Environment Division of the House Appropriations Committee. Our first bill to be heard was from the North Dakota University System, including each of the 11 institutions. They provided us with numerous publications that were very well written and were professionally done. I promised myself to keep an open mind, to be objective and to have an understanding of the needs. My confession, well, that promise was all too soon broken at no fault of my own. We spent hours struggling through university budget after budget, finding no consistency, very little definition, elusive tracking and financial numbers that are astounding. It did me in. As hard as one may try to appropriate taxpayers money to Higher Education in an effective and efficient process, the University System has a unique way of baffling and confusing individuals, making legislator appropriations very difficult. It leaves us to try and sort it out. For example, base level is that amount of financial needs the University System begins each biennium funding request. Then the University System builds on that base level with other financial needs for the upcoming biennium to derive its total budget for the upcoming biennium. Sounded quite simple to this first time appropriator. That is until one asks what comprises the base level funding. There exists in the University System a budget line item titled Extraordinary Repairs. Naturally that varies from university to university. One university had over $540,000 last biennium. One would then imagine it would vary from year to year. And since it varies from year to year, it would NOT be added to the base level funding request. Well, I was wrong. The Office of Management and Budget corrected me - the University System includes that amount in the base level for the biennium. This needs further discussion and definition. No doubt they have extraordinary repairs and those costs need to be covered. This, as well as other costs in the University System, and how they are derived, how they are requested, needs scrutiny. We have not finalized our Divisions action on the Higher Education budget. Needless to say, the percent of increase in Higher Education budget far exceeds the percent of increase in students. I suspect there will be a sharp reduction from what the University System has proposed and from what the Governor has outlined. What adds to the difficulty in appropriating is that we are writing checks on a balance that is elusive, but yet the best number we can derive. In the 2015-2017 biennium, general fund revenues collected are projected to be $5 billion, down $550 million from the December 2014 projection and $565 million less than the current biennium, but $1.7 billion more than the 2011-2013 biennium. The 2015-2017 oil and gas tax revenues are projected to be $4.2 billion, which is down $4 billion from the December 2014 projection and down $1.8 billion from the current biennium.Our economy remains strong and we should be able to fund our priorities. We do need to proceed with caution however.

Signs posting $1.98 for a gallon of unleaded gasoline dotted the flat horizon in Grand Forks and some Fargo stations earlier in the month, but stations in the west continued to post prices ranging from $2.10 to $2.30.
\
And although North Dakota's gas prices tend to fall in line with the nation's average prices, the disparity between pricing in cities has become ever more prevalent in the past few months.
\
""I've been tracking these (prices)for about two years, and average daily difference is about 9 cents,""said Gene LaDoucer, spokesperson with AAA North Dakota based in Fargo.
\
More recently, the differences in cents a gallon were in the double digits, sometimes hitting more than a 20-cent gap between Fargo and Bismarck prices.
\
The difference is in the competition, said LaDoucer.
\
LaDoucer said gas stations in the east contend with lower gas taxes from Minnesota. But that difference is 1 to 3 cents a gallon; Minnesota unleaded gas tax is 20 cents a gallon, with a 2-cent spill tax added on approximately eight months a year, according to the petroleum division of the Minnesota Department of Revenue.
\
North Dakota unleaded gas tax is 23 cents a gallon, and federal taxes come to 18.4 a gallon.
\
What it also boils down to is demand, the number of gas stations and the constant competitive environments in the Grand Forks and Fargo areas, LaDoucer said.
\
Because truly, as wholesale pricing shows, there's little difference in wholesale pricing of regular unleaded gasoline for the three cities.
\
Pricing a gallon of gas
\
The bottom line of unleaded gas pricing between Fargo, Grand Forks and Bismarck is a difference of pennies, according to wholesale pricing information obtained from the Oil Price Information Service, a subscription-based pricing index.
\
On Oct. 24, Bismarck's wholesale unleaded gas prices averaged 2.34 cents higher than Fargo's, and Fargo wholesale unleaded gas prices averaged 2.65 cents higher than Grand Fork's.
\
That pricing includes pipeline costs or fees, according to OPIS.
\
Adding state and federal taxes, Bismarck's wholesale-to-pump difference, or margin, was 22.34 cents.
\
Fargo's margin was 7 cents, and Grand Forks' was 11.93 cents.
\
As oil prices began to steadily move up later last week, after OPEC cut production, the wholesale prices increased on Wednesday and Thursday, tightening the margins for all of the markets.
\
Bismarck's margin dropped to 18.79 cents a gallon, Fargo's dropped to 4.8 cents a gallon and Grand Forks' margin dropped to 5.75 cents a gallon.
\
On Thursday, wholesale prices of unleaded gas differed by less than a penny:$1.7095 a gallon for Bismarck, $1.7046 a gallon for Fargo and $1.7013 a gallon for Grand Forks.
\
Retail pricing was still spread out: $2.282 a gallon in Bismarck, $2.138 a gallon in Fargo and $2.162 in Grand Forks.The margins were 15.8 cents a gallon for Bismarck, 1.9 cents a gallon for Fargo and 4.67 cents a gallon for Grand Forks.
\
According to OPIS, the average margin a gallon in the state hovers around 14.3 cents.
\
Those margins are estimates calculated before overhead costs. Note that stations and companies do not buy fuel on a daily basis.
\
But Scott Berhang with OPIS said any margin at the retail level is a good one.
\
Gas wars
\
""There's some very competitive gas stations in our community that kind of drives the price of gasoline,""LaDoucer said, commenting on Fargo's pricing. ""That isn't apparent in Bismarck.""
\
There are fewer gas stations in the Bismarck-Mandan area than Fargo, and fewer brands, according to OPIS.
\
OPIS tracks only four brands of unleaded gas in Bismarck, while it tracks 13 brands in Fargo and 12 brands in Grand Forks.
\
Bismarck-Mandan has about 48 gas stations, according to information from the Petroleum Marketer's Association. A yellow pages search of service stations and gas stations in Fargo produced more than 80 results and Grand Forks had about 60.
\
Matt Bjornson, whose family owns Bjornson Oil and a gas station in Fargo, said getting into the gas business in Fargo is not the way to make money.
\
""What we do is we take surveys every day to make sure our prices are competitive. To maintain our volume, in hopes of better days,""Bjornson said. ""The price in Fargo is not just competitive, it's ridiculous.""
\
""I would say Fargo is in a gas war more often than not,""he said.
\
Bjornson said additional costs, such as people using credit cards to pay for gas, completely cut into any sort of margin.
\
In fact, with Fargo's margin sitting at less than 2 cents on Thursday, Bjornson and many other gas stations are operating at a loss on unleaded gasoline.
\
Not in Bismarck
\
""It's terrible to be (in business) in Fargo or Grand Forks,""said David Froelich, president of Missouri Valley Petroleum, which supplies 15 gas stations in the Bismarck-Mandan area and owns five.
\
Froelich said there's a Tesoro station in Fargo that hasn't been sold because the market there is so difficult.
\
""Fargo's a depressed market. It's just a different, unique market,""Froelich said. ""There's a lot of marketers that sell gasoline, that don't need to make money selling gasoline. They're using gasoline as a loss-leader.""
\
And while Grand Forks hadn't traditionally been much lower than Fargo, recent low pricing by the Sam's Club gas station in the area contributed to an intense three-month gas war, LaDoucer said.
\
""In the Grand Forks market, they fell really fast, but they've started to move back up,""LaDoucer said.
\
Daily gas pricing searches of Fargo, Grand Forks and Bismarck show a sometimes more than 10-cent range in pricing between gas stations within the first two cities, but consistent pricing across the board in Bismarck.
\
That can be attributed to fewer gas stations, fewer owners or fewer brands.
\
Although the Tribune was unable to pin down the number of gas station owners in Bismarck compared to Fargo and Grand Forks, Froelich emphasized that there is solid competition in the Bismarck market.
\
""Everybody is so price sensitive,""Froelich said.
\
As soon as a price dips at another station, other stations follow suit to keep up, he said, emphasizing that it's the only business where prices are posted on big signs for everyone to see.
\
""It takes us five minutes.We have to change our price based on what our competitors are doing,""he said.
\
Other retailers declined to comment or deferred to Froelich when contacted.
\
Leif Peterson at the Tesoro Refinery agreed that the Grand Forks and Fargo areas are tight markets.
\
""They're operating at cost,""Peterson said. ""Iwould hope that any retailer would be entitled to a profit.""
\
Enter Sam's Club
\
Some Grand Forks gas stations were operating below cost when prices dropped below $2 a gallon, and LaDoucer anticipates the introduction of the Sam's Club gas station to put a small damper on pricing in Bismarck.
\
""There tended to be a price war between the Sam's Club and other gas stations (in Grand Forks),"" LaDoucer said. ""Isuspect there might be the same when Sam's Club opens in Bismarck.""
\
LaDoucer noted that there wasn't a significant change in prices immediately after Sam's Club opened its station in October 2005. But the prices started dropping dramatically after oil prices started dipping again in mid-September.
\
The Bismarck Sam's Club terminal is expected to open on Nov. 7, said Olan James, spokesperson for Sam's Club.
\
And they expect to be competitive, James said.
\
""In any area where we operate stations, we're there to be competitive and to be the low-priced leader in that market,""James said. ""Our gasoline stations, we look at them being a convenient option for our members.""
\
Customers must have a Sam's Club membership to buy gas at the Sam'sClub price.
\
LaDoucer said that gasoline prices may level out between the cities as oil prices slowly climb again.
\
""What we see, is when prices are moving rapidly one way or another, you'll see a spread,"" LaDoucer said, adding that Bismarck tended to be slower in passing on lower prices to consumers.""Because of market conditions, and differing factors, prices won't move as fast.""

56,"Owners of electric and hybrid vehicles in North Dakota would pay an annual fee to make up for lost gas tax revenue under a bill crafted by a Grand Forks lawmaker.\Republican state Sen. Curt Kreun said his proposal would help balance the scales between owners of traditional gas guzzlers who help fund road improvements by paying fuel taxes and drivers of more environmentally friendly vehicles who use those same roads. Under his bill, electric vehicle owners would face an annual $248 ""road use fee"" and hybrid drivers would see a $71 annual bill.\The fee amounts were calculated using average fuel economy and annual mileage figures. If passed, the electric vehicle fee would be the largest among the 20 states that already impose one, said Kevin Pula, a senior policy specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures.\Kreun's bill, which will be debated during the legislative session that starts next month, comes as officials warn of heavy costs to maintain North Dakota's transportation system. A report the Upper Great Plains Transportation Institute released earlier this year pegged the state's total infrastructure funding needs at $21.2 billion between 2016 and 2035.\""It's a fairness issue to keep the roads up as best we can,"" Kreun said of his proposal.\The state has a 23-cent-per-gallon gas tax that raised $165.7 million for road and transit projects in fiscal year 2018, according to North Dakota Department of Transportation spokeswoman Jamie Olson. She said the agency's proposed budget ""does not propose or support any fee increases.""\The NCSL said states haven't raked in much extra cash from the fees, however, because ""the market share for hybrid and electric vehicles is still small.""\Only 141 electric vehicles were registered in North Dakota this year, along with 3,849 hybrids, Olson said.

58,"Oh gosh, we've got another Trump.\This has been very difficult, people. Every day concerned citizens put together their critique of the president's policies, and before nighttime he's a completely different dude.\You remember the Somewhat Normal Republican Trump, who answers to both SNORE and SNORT, depending on his energy level at the moment. He mainly likes to repeal federal regulations - free mentally ill people to buy guns; don't let a little clean water stand between coal owners and their yen to dump trash. Last week SNORT issued a tax reform plan that was classic GOP in its extreme vagueness on how to pay for its multitude of cuts. (""Eliminate tax breaks for special interests."")\Then suddenly, out of nowhere, came Weirdly Liberal Trump (WELT). He mused about breaking up the big banks; special aide Ivanka plugged helping Syrian refugees. Liberal Trump even expressed interest in a gas tax hike to pay for infrastructure repairs.\""It's something that I would certainly consider,"" he told Bloomberg News. The idea of a Republican administration, bound at the hip to the energy industry, championing a gas tax hike is a little stunning. It would, of course, pay for a ton of construction jobs, repair crumbling roads and bridges and be great for the environment. But I guarantee you Mike Pence would never bring it up.\Perhaps we should rethink all that impeachment talk.\Lately Congress has been in an uproar over health care, and House Speaker Paul (My Life Is Ruined) Ryan is going crazy trying to placate both sides on the matter of insurance coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions. WELT wants to be the progressive hero. ""Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it. I said, Has to be,'"" Trump told CBS' John Dickerson.\That was shortly before Trump went off the handle when Dickerson asked about his claims of being wiretapped by Barack Obama. ""I don't stand by anything,"" Trump said, unnecessarily, before he tossed Dickerson out of the Oval Office for pressing him on the matter.\Viewers got to witness a transformation from the new liberal presidential version to the very familiar Nearly Unhinged Trump (NUT). Actually, this one often seems more along the line of Totally Unhinged, but then we'd have to call him TUT.\It's generally pretty easy to tell which president is talking. NUT was the one who thought Andrew Jackson could have stopped the Civil War. So, for sure, was the Trump who expressed astonishment that being president was harder work than his previous jobs. (""I thought it would be easier."")\NUT tends to reside in the world of Twitter. And sometimes he fights with his other versions. Weirdly Liberal Trump was very happy when Congress came up with a spending deal that guarantees the government will continue operating through the summer. (""This is what winning looks like!"") Nearly Unhinged hated hated hated it.\""Our country needs a good shutdown' in September to fix mess!"" twittered NUT. He had promised us he'd make history, but even his critics didn't expect he'd do it by becoming the first American president to express a yearning for the government to come to a screeching halt.\The quick shift between Trumps is always a challenge to the minions in charge of interpreting him to the world. Budget director Mick Mulvaney, who is getting to be one of our very favorite explainers, said that the president was calling for a shutdown because he became ""frustrated"" when Democrats expressed pleasure at the resolution of the spending standoff. (""They went out to try and spike the football and make him look bad."") In reality, Mulvaney insisted, the Democrats were hoping for a collapse in negotiations because they wanted ""to make this president look like he did not know what he was doing.""\And the whole world mused: not a hard lift.\Neither the liberal nor the normal-Republican Trump is very good at interesting new ideas that might actually, in the real world, happen. Unhinged Trump is obviously the attention-getter, and a lot of the excitement comes from the fact that his proposals are often exactly the opposite of whatever he was championing last week.\He's also unfettered by the restrictions in imagination that would come from previous knowledge of how government operates. It appears, for instance, that NUT was surprised by the discovery that it took 60 votes to pass most legislation in the Senate. This came out in a tweet expressing shock, shock, shock that 41 senators could force the majority into compromise. ""Either elect more Republican senators in 2018 or change the rule now to 51 percent,"" he recommended.\Senate Republicans dismissed the idea instantly. ""We are not going to do that,"" said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Most of them had spent much of the Obama administration happily thwarting a Democratic president's agenda with that very rule. Perhaps some of them were already anticipating that by 2021, it would come in handy again.\Gail Collins writes a syndicated column for the New York Times."
59,"FARGO - The transfer of the state women's prison from Bismarck to the farming town of New England was widely seen as a temporary move when it was made in 2003.\Now, more than 15 years later, the debate over whether to move the women's prison back to Bismarck has largely focused on concerns of the economic impact to a struggling rural town of 600.\Critics are quick to claim it contradicts Gov. Doug Burgum's Main Street Initiative to revitalize the state's cities and towns - but the governor and corrections officials say the proposal is driven by a gaping disparity between services that are available to incarcerated men and women.\Consider a few examples:\• Men who are serving sentences in North Dakota prisons have much greater access to medical and rehabilitative services than women.\• Women prison inmates have no access to medication-assisted treatment to help them overcome addictions.\• Women in the prison have no community access to medical or dental services, meaning they have to be transported many miles for care.\• Care coordination and peer support capacity for men incarcerated in Bismarck is more than four times greater than what is available to women.\""The need is obvious,"" said Burgum, adding that the state has a responsibility to treat men and women inmates equally.\The wide disparity in services available to women inmates, officials said, was the catalyst for a series of related, domino changes involving corrections and behavioral health services to accommodate the women's prison move and gain efficiencies - centerpieces in Burgum's agenda to reinvent state government.\The plan calls for moving women prisoners to the Missouri River Correctional Center near Bismarck, which now houses low-risk male prisoners and is separate from the new state penitentiary, a $64 million facility that opened in 2013.\Modifying the correctional center to accommodate women would cost $1.8 million, and will save $2 million in operating costs during the first biennium, said Leann Bertsch, director of the North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\""We'll save even more in the next biennium,"" she said, after the costs have been absorbed.\For the governor's proposal to become reality, state lawmakers must first approve it. On Jan. 16, people on both sides of the issue crowded into a hearing of the House Appropriations Committee for the Human Resources Division.\Several former inmates testified in favor of the move, while many residents of the prison town showed up wearing ""I stand with New England"" stickers. Hettinger County Sheriff Sarah Warner attended to show support for the townspeople, whom she said benefit from the prison.\""This is just another pull-out from our small community,"" she said. ""We need these opportunities to stay alive.""\The committee's chairman, Rep. Jon Nelson, R-Rugby, said last week that the governor's proposal is far from a done deal. If female inmates are moved out of the New England prison, Nelson said he would support keeping the facility open and housing about 100 minimum security male inmates there with a focus on job training.\'The human toll'\Although moving the women's prison will save the state money, the major motivation is to provide better rehabilitation services that will produce better outcomes, Bertsch said.\""For me personally, it's really the human toll,"" she said. ""That does translate into fiscal and financial impact as well.""\A recent example: A pregnant woman who was receiving methadone treatment for an opioid addiction was going to be moved to the women's prison - until a doctor intervened to keep her in the Cass County Jail, where medication-assisted addiction treatment is available.\""That's a serious concern,"" Bertsch said, noting that methadone withdrawal can be fatal to an unborn child. ""It would have put the fetus in peril.""\If women prisoners now incarcerated in New England are moved to the Missouri River Correctional Center, the plan is to move those low-risk men to the campus of the State Hospital in Jamestown, adjacent to a satellite prison that houses medium-risk men.\Burgum's proposal also calls for a new 80-bed state hospital, with a cost of $35 million, paid by earnings from the state's Legacy Fund, which receives oil and gas tax revenue.\The current state hospital is licensed to accept up to 105 inpatients, but more and more behavioral health services are being delivered in community- and home-based settings.\""That's a better place for them to be long-term,"" said Tom Eide, director of field services for the North Dakota Department of Human Services. ""Hopefully we can get them closer to their homes.""\Also, the layout of the modern hospital will enable a smaller staff, resulting in operating savings. The efficiency gains from a new building and staffing total $8 million per biennium, Eide said. Chronic staff shortages, requiring overtime pay, make the streamlined operations imperative, he said.\""We've got to do things to get more efficient,"" Eide said.\A new hospital would replace a setup that dates back to the 1980s, when treatment methods were much different than today, he said.\""The ability to have a new facility is going to provide a better environment for our patients and a safer environment for patients and staff,"" Eide said. ""It is a more healing and healthful environment,"" including more open spaces and natural light.\A new hospital also would include a new clinic, and a new human services center would share the campus, again resulting in shared facilities and efficiency gains, Eide said.\Avoiding crises\The brick-and-mortar proposals involved in the initiative to move the women's prison and build a new state hospital have captured most of the attention, but they are in tandem with a major realignment of programs in both corrections and behavioral health services.\In each case, the goal is to intervene with services more quickly and more effectively, avoiding acute crises that result in incarceration or mental health hospitalization, officials said.\The service inequities between women and men prison inmates once forced the state to defend a costly discrimination lawsuit, filed in 2003, that took six years to dismiss - a consideration in Burgum's sweeping proposals.\Besides the gap in services, the prison's remote location, far from the homes and families of most inmates, is seen as an impediment to rehabilitating women, the vast majority of whom will be released.\Ninety percent of women in the Dakota Women's Correctional Center come from communities in central and eastern North Dakota, often hundreds of miles from New England, which lacks bus service.\""It has a negative effect on the family, particularly children,"" Burgum said. Studies have found, he added, that children whose parents have been incarcerated are at greater risk to be jailed or imprisoned.\Three in four of the women in the prison have children under the age of 18.\More than half of the inmates reoffend, perpetuating a cycle that is expensive to taxpayers - the tab to keep an inmate in prison for a year is $42,000 - and costly in the disruptions to families and society.\""We're really not getting a return on our investment,"" Bertsch said.\Besides lacking services, the New England location results in significant transportation costs when prisoners have to be driven for medical and dental care.\""Our system as it is is pretty dysfunctional,"" Bertsch said. ""We've just had to deal with the deficiencies because it really is a difficult political situation and I recognize that.""\The prison means 56 jobs for New England. But Bertsch and Burgum are quick to note that southwestern North Dakota has between 800 and 1,000 job openings.\""If it's about jobs in southwestern North Dakota, we've got a lot of unfilled jobs,"" Burgum said. The state's priority must be about providing better services that will not only save money but will lead to more productive lives through rehabilitation, the governor said.\""That's what the focus has to be,"" Burgum said. ""It's not about how we make better prison jobs.""\Job Service of North Dakota can help to match workers with jobs, and legislators can provide help for job retraining and transitional programs, he said. Similarly, there can be a discussion about finding a new use for the women's prison, a former Catholic high school and dormitory.\""There's all manner of things we can do there,"" Burgum added. ""This is a completely solvable, completely doable issue.""\CREDIT: Patrick Springer Forum News Service"
60,"
WASHINGTON -- The Republican-controlled Senate brushed aside a presidential veto threat Tuesday and passed a $295 billion highway bill, arguing that massive spending on bigger and better roads was necessary to fight congestion and unsafe roadways.
\
The administration, while pressing Congress to pass a new highway bill, said the Senate version was too expensive in a time of war and debt and could result in the first veto of the Bush presidency.
\
The vote was 89-11 with a majority of Republicans joining Democrats in approving the six-year package that the administration said was $11 billion above what it would accept.
\
North Dakota would see $1.5 billion over five years, a 31 percent increase over the previous highway bill, said Sen. Ken Conrad, D- N.D.
\
Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, described himself as one of the most conservative members of Congress but said he was at odds with the administration because ""there are two areas where we need to spend money. One is national defense and the other is infrastructure.""
\
The Senate now must work out its differences with the House- passed bill, which in addition to approving less money specifies thousands of specific projects requested by lawmakers, from bike paths to sidewalks to parking lots. Almost all of the Senate money is divided among the states by a complicated formula.
\
In addition to granting money to states to repair and build roads and bridges, the bill would provide more than $50 billion for public transit, fund recreational road programs and promote highway safety.
\
""This bill will have an impact on every city and every town and every state."" said Sen. James Jeffords, I-Vt., the minority leader on the Environment Committee. ""I urge President Bush to reconsider his veto threat against this legislation.""
\
The Senate vote was in some ways a repeat of last year, when the senators approved a bill well above what the White House deemed affordable. In the end no compromise was reached with Congress, and lawmakers have had to pass six temporary extensions of the old 6- year act, which expired on Sept. 30, 2003.
\
The House in March passed a $284 billion bill, the maximum amount the White House says it will accept without a veto. The Senate, in adding $11 billion, said it came up with new revenues for the highway trust fund -- the principal source of money for federal highway grants to the states -- without adding to the deficit.
\
White House press secretary Scott McClellan repeated the veto threat Tuesday, saying the president was ""very serious"" about following a fiscally responsible budget.
\
Before the final vote, the Senate rejected, by 84-16, an amendment proposed by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., that would have shrunk the bill back to $284 billion.
\
With 20 months gone since the last highway bill, there is growing pressure to come up with a compromise. The latest extension runs out May 31.
\
""We've already lost one spring construction season in Michigan and we certainly don't want to lose another one,"" said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich.
\
""We are going to get a bill,"" said House Transportation Committee Chairman Don Young, R-Alaska.
\
Senate leaders sought to pass the highway bill before entering debate over the use of the filibuster to block judicial nominations, an issue that could disrupt the legislative agenda.
\
There was no dispute over the need for a new highway program: Poor road conditions are a factor in one-third of the 42,000 traffic fatalities every year, and road congestion costs the nation billions in lost productivity and wasted fuel, studies indicate.
\
The legislation funds many relatively small programs -- bike routes to schools, covered bridges, ferry terminals -- as well as programs to promote fuel-efficient vehicles and authorize tolls to finance new interstate lanes.
\
Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., won voice vote approval of an amendment that would require the Environmental Protection Agency to update fuel economy testing to reflect real-life driving conditions. Gas mileage stickers on new cars now inflate true fuel economy performance by 10 percent to 30 percent.
\
The Senate also adopted, 86-14, a provision that would increase grants for safety programs to states that allow police to stop motorists who don't wear seat belts even when there is no other traffic violation.
\
The House bill, unlike the Senate version, includes some 4,000 specific projects, worth some $12 billion, that were requested by lawmakers for their districts. These projects, cited by fiscal conservatives as ""pork,"" will be one sticking point as House and Senate negotiators try to work out a compromise.
\
Another difference is the formula by which the federal government divides up highway trust fund money for the states. The trust fund comes from the 18.4 cents a gallon federal gas tax, and about half the states, mainly from fast-growing or heavily traveled areas, complain that they pay more into the fund than they get back.
\
Of the 11 senators who voted against the bill, two are Wisconsin Democrats, Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold. They were joined by Republicans Jon Kyl and John McCain of Arizona, Sam Brownback of Kansas, Judd Gregg and John Sununu of New Hampshire, Jim DeMint and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and John Cornyn and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas.
\
The bill is H.R. 3.
\
Highway spending
\
3 Potholes, beware: The Senate, by a vote of 89-11, passed a $295 billion highway bill Tuesday that would provide funds for building and repairing roads and bridges, public transportation, recreational roads and highway safety programs.
\
3 What's next: A congressional conference committee must resolve differences between the Senate bill and a $284 billion highway bill passed by the House in March.
\
3 The White House: President Bush has threatened to veto the Senate legislation because he thinks it is too costly. The White House says the $284 billion in the House bill is the maximum it will accept.

North Dakota has been doing well in the rankings: Lowest unemployment in the nation. Highest job growth. Third in crude oil production. All kinds of accolades for a pro-business environment.
\
Then along comes the State Integrity Investigation and its Corruption Risk Report Card. North Dakota gets an F for an overall grade.
\
North Dakota isn't Chicago. The state doesn't have bribes and bribe-takers. We don't have former state officials serving time. We don't have former governors behind bars. We haven't had a governor even charged with a serious crime since the 1930s, when Gov. William Langer was ""indicted for soliciting and collecting money for political purposes from federal employees and conspiring to obstruct the orderly operation of an act of Congress."" He was finally cleared in the appeals process, but not before he had been removed from office by the state Supreme Court. North Dakotans, of course, re-elected him governor and eventually sent him to the U.S. Senate.
\
Along with others in the state, I was prepared to defend North Dakota's honor from charges of corruption. Then I thought about Dickinson State University and the revelations there related to recruiting foreign students. I read the recent DSU Performance Audit Report prepared by the state auditor's office. I reviewed the stories of city and county officials in the state who were caught with their hands in the taxpayers' pocket. Some pretty dismal stuff has been going on in North Dakota lately.
\
It sounds like North Dakotans need to do more than lock our doors.
\
That Corruption Report Card gives the state failing grades in the following areas: state civil service management, state insurance commissions (I'm not sure what that's about), political financing, legislative accountability, lobbying disclosure, ethics enforcement agencies and redistricting. There's a D for executive accountability, a pair of C's for judicial accountability and public access to information, and finally a pair of As for internal auditing and procurement.
\
Because we are a small state, the need for oversight committees, such as ethics enforcement agencies, is less acute. After all, North Dakota is alleged to have more local government per capita than any other state. How many more committees can we staff?
\
The time has come, I think, for the state to do a better job at providing accountability, ethics checks and transparency.
\
For one thing, there's this rich flow of oil and gas tax revenue coming into state coffers. When the state was struggling to get by, there wasn't much to steal or misappropriate. Now, there's enough money in the state to make theft worthwhile for an enterprising crook.
\
DSU provides a telling lesson on the need for accountability and transparency.
\
Finally, with each legislative session, the doors to more meetings are closed and more documents are stamped ""secret."" The state's once wide open government has been closed off to citizens, bill by bill, as lawmakers make moves to protect perceptions of privacy, competitiveness and honor. We're still better off than many states, but the state's record has become tarnished.
\
Actually, North Dakota is both safer than we generally think it is, and less safe than we assume - a contradiction, I know. Compared to high crime and high jinks states, we're innocents.
\
But compared to the state history, often seen through false nostalgia, North Dakota is becoming more like everywhere else - which means living in fear or at least locking your doors.
\
It's time for a reality check, and it should result in more oversight, accountability and transparency.

62,"
As the tax deadline hits, taxpayers frantically completing their 1040s may be wondering just what their hard-earned federal tax dollars pay for, anyway.
\
Washington will spend $23,760 per household in 2006 - the highest inflation-adjusted total since World War II, and $6,500 more than in 2001. The federal government will collect $20,044 per household in taxes. The remaining $3,716 represents this year's budget deficit per household, which, along with all prior government debt, will be dumped in the laps of our children.
\
Here's a breakdown of how Washington will spend that $23,760 per household:
\
3 Social Security/Medicare: $7,875. The 15.3 percent payroll tax, split evenly between the employer and employee, covers most of these costs. This system can remain sustainable only if there are enough workers to support all retirees, which is why it risks collapsing under the weight of 77 million retiring baby boomers. If nothing is done, taxes eventually will need to be raised by the current equivalent of $11,000 per household to pay all promised benefits. The unpredictable costs of the new Medicare drug entitlement could add thousands more to each household's tax bill.
\
3 Defense: $4,701. The defense budget covers everything from military salaries to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to the research, development and acquisition of new technologies. Lawmakers drastically reduced defense spending following the collapse of communism in the early 1990s. The 9/11 attacks reversed this trend, and the $1,900 per household increase since 2001 has returned defense spending to its historical levels.
\
3 Low-income programs: $3,579. Nearly half of this spending subsidizes state Medicaid programs that provide health services to poor families. Other low-income spending includes: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps, housing subsidies, child- care subsidies, Supplemental Security Income and low-income tax credits. Despite recent rhetoric about ""cuts for poor,"" anti- poverty spending now tops 3 percent of GDP for the first time ever.
\
3 Interest on the federal debt: $1,930. The federal government is $8.2 trillion in debt. It owes $4.9 trillion to public bond owners and the rest to other federal agencies (mostly to repay the Social Security trust fund, which lawmakers raid annually). Despite rising debt, record-low interest rates have limited costs. As interest rates rise back to normal levels, these costs will spike.
\
3 Federal employee retirement benefits: $870. This spending funds the retirement and disability benefits of federal employees, including the military.
\
3 Education: $732. Education spending is primarily a state and local function; 9 percent of the total comes from Washington. Federal education spending has surged 137 percent since the 2001 enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act. Most federal dollars are spent on low-income school districts, special education and college student financial aid.
\
3 Health research/regulation: $671. This spending is up 78 percent since 2001, and much of this growth is concentrated in the National Institute of Health. This category includes the Food and Drug Administration and dozens of grant programs for health providers.
\
3 Veterans' benefits: $618. The federal government provides income and health benefits to war veterans. Spending is up 56 percent since 2001.
\
3 Community and regional development: $456. The $300 per household leap in this category since 2004 comes from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is financing much of the Hurricane Katrina relief.
\
3 Highways/mass transit: $402. Most highway and mass-transit spending is financed by the 18.4 cent per-gallon federal gas tax. Washington subtracts an administrative cost and sends this money back to the states with numerous strings attached. Some economists suggest it would be more efficient to let states collect this tax and decide how to spend the money themselves.
\
3 Justice administration: $363. Justice spending includes federal attorneys and prisons, as well as law-enforcement grant programs. New homeland security costs have added $80 per household to justice spending.
\
3 Unemployment benefits: $338. Unemployment costs fluctuate based on the number of unemployed Americans. This year, unemployment costs are decreasing as job growth continues.
\
3 International affairs: $305. This includes foreign economic and military assistance, operation of American embassies abroad and contributions to organizations such as the United Nations. International spending has doubled since 9/11.
\
3 Natural resources/environment: $287. This includes national parks, federal lands, water projects and environmental clean-up.
\
3 Agriculture: $235. Despite rhetoric about supporting small family farms, the vast majority of farm subsidies are distributed to large farms with average household incomes over $135,000.
\
The programs listed above cover $23,362 per household. The remaining $398 is allocated to all other federal programs, including social services, space exploration, air transportation and energy.
\
Taxpayers must decide for themselves if they're getting their money's worth.

The North Dakota House and Senate each churned through a large backlog of bills needing votes this week before the deadline for crossover.
\
Deadline for crossover of bills from each chamber was by the end of Friday. The Senate cleared approximately 70 bills, adjourning around 9 a.m. Thursday. The House, which had approximately 100 bills on its agenda, finished shortly before noon Thursday.
\
Lawmakers had their share of opportunities to make their case on a variety of bills during day-long floor sessions this week. Among some of the words that stuck out during the days leading to crossover:
\
* Sen. Jerry Klein, R-Fessenden, had a vivid way of describing the fight between the Independent Water Providers group and those operating the Western Area Water Supply Authority. His words came prior to the debate on Senate Bill 2359, which made some amendments to the WAWS Authority's operations.
\
""There's been tension,"" Klein said. ""We can call it anything we want - Hatfields and McCoys, 'As The Water Turns.' (We) need to keep the water flowing.""
\
* An oil tax restructuring bill, Senate Bill 2336, drew passionate rhetoric from those on both sides of the bill on the Senate floor Tuesday. The bill eventually lowers the oil extraction tax, changes the definitions for stripper wells, requires annual recertification of stripper wells and would eliminate a series of ""triggers"" that kick in if oil prices drop sharply.
\
Sen. Rich Wardner, R-Dickinson, argued that a stable oil tax would promote a more business-friendly environment and entice drilling companies to remain in North Dakota long-term. He said taxes influence company actions, pointing to the 6.5 percent extraction tax approved by voters in 1980.
\
""I was there back then. Measure 6 passed and everything was fine. Except we had a bust,"" Wardner said. ""You never know about this commodity.""
\
Members of the Democratic caucus argued that SB2336 was a giveaway to the oil and gas industry.
\
Sen. Connie Triplett, D-Grand Forks, said North Dakota oil and gas tax rates are in the middle of the pack when it comes to oil-producing states. She said it's the Legislature's responsibility to ensure the state maximizes the benefits from its resources and dictates a fair cost of doing business.
\
""The oil companies don't get to tell us what rates they will accept or reject,"" Triplett said. ""These companies ... don't own this chamber yet.""
\
* The Senate also had a short debate Tuesday on Senate Bill 2229 before its passage. SB2229 would allow school boards to authorize early childhood education programs and allow them to use local tax revenues as well as state, federal and private dollars to fund them.
\
Sen. Phil Murphy, D-Portland, is a sponsor of SB2229 and took time to promote it. He said there is high demand for early childhood education and day care in the state. Murphy said the state does have some responsibility to provide it if it has the money. He said not everyone is able to grow up in a home with parents able to be around daily, as was the case for him and other lawmakers when growing up.
\
""I grew up in a Norman Rockwell painting compared to what a lot of people did,"" Murphy said.
\
* On Wednesday afternoon, the House took up House Bill 1362, a bill for expanding Medicaid as part of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
\
An amended HB1362 came up for debate and passed 57-36. Several Republicans stood and voiced their opposition. Some said although they don't like the Affordable Care Act or the Medicaid expansion, the act is the law of the land.
\
Rep. Scott Louser, R-Minot, stood and said he was against the expansion. He sought to draw an analogy between the federal government and the states in terms of the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion.
\
He referred to the federal government as being like Lucy from the comic strip ""Peanuts,"" holding a football in place and pulling it away right before Charlie Brown can kick it.
\
""I can't help but think we're being forced to play the role of Charlie Brown,"" Louser said.

North Dakota's oil production will soon have a million reasons for a new round of headlines.
\
The state is within reach of 1 million barrels of oil per day, a more than 10-fold increase from just a decade ago.
\
Production reached 973,000 barrels a day in Novem-ber, but cold weather dropped the daily tally back to 923,227 barrels a day in December.
\
If the state gets a break in the winter weather, a rollover to seven figures could come in the January or February figures, said Department of Mineral Resources spokeswoman Alison Ritter. Reporting lags a month.
\
Celebration
\
Citizens will hear some fanfare when all those zeroes roll into view.
\
The North Dakota Petroleum Council is already planning a celebration, but will hold off until late June, both to hedge its bets and to take advantage of summer weather.
\
Council spokeswoman Alexis Brinkman said plans tentatively are to hold a public ceremony at the Clarence Iverson No. 1 south of Tioga, where oil was officially struck in April 1951 on a truly landmark day in history. It set the stage for a series of oil discovery phases, none more prolific than the current highly technical drilling in the Bakken and Three Forks shale formations.
\
After the ceremony, the Petroleum Council is planning to hold a speech-fest and barbecue in Tioga.
\
""It'll be our way to celebrate and to thank the people of North Dakota for being participants and helping out along the way,"" Brinkman said.
\
With a few exceptions, North Dakota's oil production has set records every month for the past four years.
\
The state has barreled up the ranks of oil-producing states and now holds second place, ahead of Alaska and trailing only Texas. The vault past Alaska in 2012 was helped by that state's falling production. Texas, at 2.7 million barrels a day, will be much harder to ever catch, much less pass. Lynn Helms, director of the Department of Mineral Resources, predicts oil production will reach 1.6 million barrels daily by 2017.
\
Reflection
\
This pause at the brink of 1 million is a good time to reflect on what it all means.
\
It'll mean - for one thing - that an estimated $8.8 million in oil and gas tax revenue will be generated every day, said state Tax Commission research and communication director Kathy Strombeck.
\
Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem, as a member of the three-member Industrial Commission, oversees oil permitting and regulation through the Department of Mineral Resources.
\
Stenehjem said it means a new era of prosperity for a state whose citizens have endured great hardships in the 125 years since statehood most of those years when wheat was all North Dakota had to offer the world.
\
""We've suffered through droughts, floods, blizzards, locusts, every catastrophe of nature.
\
We've persevered. We certainly can handle the challenges of prosperity,"" he said.
\
Most new oil millionaires maintain a modest life, retaining their basic character, Stenehjem said.
\
""They quit fishing with dead minnows, or they buy some new farm equip-ment, but we're still North Dakotans, I think,"" he said.
\
Stenehjem said the million-barrel mark will bring out a historic need to celebrate the good things that happen in North Dakota.
\
""At the same time, we need to keep in mind there are challenges,"" he said.
\
Paying attention to the environment is one such challenge, while meeting a statutory responsibility to maximize oil and resource production at the same time is another.
\
""We have to strike the proper balance,"" he said.
\
Stenehjem's somewhat controversial work to lead the Industrial Commission to help protect a list of extraordinary places in the oil patch is mindful of that balance.
\
Stenehjem said a policy for such places should recognize the rights of the mineral owner to develop his minerals while considering the public's interest in these special places.
\
""It's all about more transparency,"" he said. ""Maybe we can explore different ways to site these rigs, something we do a lot anyway.""
\
Stenehjem, speaking as the state's top law officer, said the dark side of oil prosperity is more crime that's more complex, with big-time drug dealers, murder-for-hire situations and human trafficking - not numbering a million, certainly, but thousands more police contacts every year.
\
It's about balancing responsibility and opportunity, he said.
\
What he sees from the Industrial Commission's table is an upward trajectory as the 1-million mark comes and goes.
\
""I don't think we will peak at 1 million. It'll be higher than that. We have a long ways to go,"" he said. ""But who would have ever thought we'd pass Alaska and Oklahoma?""

65,"MANDAREE - Lisa DeVille lives in the heart of the Bakken oil formation.\DeVille is an enrolled member of the Mandan Hidatsa Arikara Nation and lives in Mandaree on the Fort Berthold Reservation. Living in the Bakken, she and her family see natural gas flares almost daily.\""We witness it, we live with oil and gas,"" DeVille said. ""The night sky is lit up like day. You can feel the earth rumble under you when those flares happen, you can hear it and smell it.""\The air quality is poor in this area because the flares put off toxic chemicals, DeVille said. The oil and gas industries have other adverse effects on the land and health of the people living there.\According to an Earthworks study done in the Mandaree area, ""visible and concerning"" emissions were found at sites near Williston and the Fort Berthold Reservation.\""If they don't get it under control, it's going to be worse than what it is today,"" she said. ""Things need to happen now.""\North Dakota is producing oil and natural gas at all-time high levels.\The Department of Mineral Resources released a report in Nov. showing September's production of oil was nearly 41 million barrels. In September of last year, North Dakota produced more than 33 million barrels of oil.\North Dakota produced more than 2.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day in Sept.\With all of the economic benefits oil and gas production bring to North Dakota, there is also a downside to this level of production.\Last year, there were 392 million barrels of oil produced in North Dakota. Approximately 168.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide are emitted from consuming that much oil, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency.\That is equivalent to carbon dioxide emissions from 36,105,912 cars.\North Dakota ranks second in the country, behind Texas, in crude oil reserves, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. North Dakota has been the second-largest oil-producing state since 2012.\North Dakota has also become one of the biggest carbon dioxide emitters in the country. The region produces 10 billion to 15 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the EPA.\A study released by the EPA in 2016 showed agriculture emits 9 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and greenhouse gas emissions from industry, such as burning fossil fuels for energy, contributes 22 percent.\Oil and gas impact\The fourth annual climate assessment by the U.S. Global Change Research Program reported climate change could put infrastructure, such as pipelines and highways, at risk, as well as the energy it carries.\""Railroads and pipelines are vulnerable to damage or disruption from increasing heavy precipitation events and associated flooding and erosion,"" the report said.\As a result, the cost of producing oil would likely increase. The cost increases could reduce production or drive up costs for consumers of the energy products.\""The process of extracting oil requires a tremendous amount of water, if you can imagine, as the climate impacts worsen and you see areas with prolonged drought, you can see how that could intensify demand for water and drive up the price,"" said Jeff Deyette, the director of state policy and analysis for the Union of Concerned Scientists.\Dexter Perkins, a geology professor at the University of North Dakota, said there is no doubt North Dakota is a big contributor to climate change.\""Climate change is the single biggest issue facing us today, and the source of it is burning fossil fuels. We have a fossil fuels industry in North Dakota, so of course we're contributing,"" Perkins said.\Kristen Hamman, spokeswoman for the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said that many do not think the oil industry has contributed to environmental changes.\""The climate is always changing, it's been changing for millions of years,"" Hamman said. ""To assign responsibility to our industry in the state of North Dakota is a big stretch.""\‘Everyone is benefitting'\Do benefits from producing oil and gas outweigh negative impacts on the environment? Many say they do.\To North Dakotans, the energy boom meant jobs and revenue pumping throughout the state. Today, with production at an all-time high, oil still represents that.\Oil production in the Bakken employs 72,000 people across the state, said Rob Lindberg, director of Bakken Backers, a nonprofit organization supporting the oil industry.\While there is less activity than at the height of the boom earlier this decade, the industry is still a $30 billion ""behemoth,"" he said. There are jobs created by oil production and construction. Oil production also creates jobs other industries, such as teachers or nurses, in nearby towns, Lindberg said.\""I graduated from high school in Jamestown in 2003,"" Lindberg said. ""There wasn't a lot going on in the state then.""\Since then, North Dakota jumped from 39th in the nation for personal income to the top four. ""That's attributable to the one major change in the state, which is oil and gas,"" he said.\Also in that time, oil production went from employing 5,000 people to employing about 55,000.\The east side of the state also felt these positive impacts on the economy. The Grand Forks Chamber of Commerce said 67 percent of its members reported higher sales because of the oil boom and 22 percent reported they added staff because of the activity in the Bakken.\In Grand Forks area, 110 businesses were doing $300 million in business per year in the Bakken area.\Brent Bogar with Jadestone Consulting researched how the oil industry supports the entire state.\Since the start of the boom, the state has collected about $18 billion in oil and gas tax, Bogar said. This includes money going into North Dakota's Legacy Fund, a rainy day fund that gets revenues from oil and gas. Since the Legacy Fund's creation in 2011, it has had more than $4 billion total deposits.\In Grand Forks alone, $50 million of oil tax revenue will go toward building a new water treatment plant. UND's new medical school building was also paid for by oil tax revenue.\""Everyone is benefitting to some degree,"" Bogar said.\\\\\\\\CREDIT: Bonnie Meibers Forum News Service"
66,"
WASHINGTON - Still bruised by the summer battle over the debt ceiling, Congress reconvenes this week for what could be an equally painful confrontation over how to put Americans back to work.
\
Lawmakers returning to Washington after a monthlong recess are in accord on at least one thing: Jobs policy must be at the top of the agenda. But there's scant hope they will put aside their differences long enough to come up with legislation that makes measurable improvements either to the unemployment rate or Congress' dismal approval rate.
\
Even the main attraction of the first week back, President Obama's speech to a joint session of Congress outlining his jobs policy, had to be pushed back a day, until Thursday. Republicans balked at letting Obama pre-empt their party's presidential debate on the first day the House is in session.
\
When Obama does get to the House podium, he's likely to get a cool reception from the GOP side of the aisle. Republicans may go along with tax break proposals but won't be friendly to ideas to extend jobless benefits or spend money on new construction projects.
\
House Republicans have prepared an autumn jobs agenda that centers on repealing what they say are job-destroying environmental and labor regulations. The first bill, slated for the week of Sept. 12, would prevent the National Labor Relations Board from restricting where an employer can locate in the United States. It grows out of a complaint issued by the NLRB that Boeing Co. was punishing union workers with plans to transfer an assembly line from Washington state to South Carolina.
\
The anti-regulation bills are likely to hit a dead end in the Democratic-controlled Senate. But the threat of them prompted Obama last week to scrap tougher Environmental Protection Agency regulations on ozone, a key ingredient of smog that causes asthma and other lung illnesses.
\
While talking jobs, lawmakers will have one eye on the initial meetings of the supercommittee established under legislation enacted in early August to increase the federal debt ceiling. The bipartisan committee has until Nov. 23 to come up with at least $1.2 trillion in deficit cuts. If it fails to do so or if Congress fails to approve its recommendations by Christmas, automatic spending cuts covering both defense and domestic programs would be triggered starting in 2013.
\
More immediately, Congress must stop itself from actually causing unemployment. Obama, in his address, is expected to urge lawmakers to act swiftly to renew aviation and surface transportation programs and avoid shutdowns that he said could put 1 million jobs at risk.
\
The Federal Aviation Administration has been operating on short-term extensions since 2007 because the House and Senate can't agree on a comprehensive plan for the future. Earlier this year, the FAA had to shut down for two weeks, resulting in tens of thousands of construction worker layoffs and $400 million in uncollected airline ticket taxes. The agency will shut down again on Sept. 16 unless Congress acts.
\
Similarly, the law that authorizes federal spending for highway and mass transit programs expires on Sept. 30. A stalemate there could disrupt collection of the 18.4-cent-a-gallon federal gas tax and have a far more devastating effect on construction jobs.
\
House Transportation Committee Chairman John Mica, R-Fla., said at the end of August that he would agree to one more short-term extension, the eighth, as he negotiates with the Senate on a long-term bill. Mica has proposed a six-year, $230 billion bill financed entirely by gasoline and diesel taxes. The Senate is calling for a two-year, $109 billion bill that would rely on $12 billion appropriated by Congress in addition to the fuel tax revenues.
\
Not all is negative on the congressional job front.
\
On its first day back today, the Senate will vote to move forward on the most extensive revamping of the patent system in six decades.
\
Senate passage of the measure, already approved by the House, would send it to Obama, who agrees with most members of Congress that the legislation will make it easier for inventors to get their products to market and thus encourage hiring.
\
There's also some optimism that Congress will soon sign off on free trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama that have been in limbo since the George W. Bush administration.
\
Before the August break, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said they had agreed on a path forward for renewing a program that helps workers affected by foreign competition and passing the trade bills, and House Speaker John Boehner also promised a vote on the worker aid bill which Obama says must be linked to the trade agreements.
\
The administration and supporters of the trade bills say they will generate tens of thousands of jobs. Some labor unions and other skeptics of free trade dispute that conclusion.
\
Also looming is the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year, when Congress is supposed to have completed the 12 appropriation bills to fund federal agencies for the coming fiscal year 2012. So far the House has passed only half of those bills, and the Senate only one, and as in past years they will have to agree on temporary stopgap extensions to avoid a partial government shutdown.
\
Things are a little easier this year because the debt and budget pact sets the overall total for the 12 bills at $1.043 trillion, a $7 billion cut from current levels.
\
Still, there will be heated debate as Democrats seek to restore cuts planned by Republicans to education, environment, foreign aid and other programs.
\
One such debate will be over funding the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has less than $800 million in its disaster fund as it faces the Hurricane Irene recovery operation.
\
Democrats say emergency spending on natural disasters has never required repayment, but Republicans say that in this new age of austerity, disaster aid must be paid for with cuts to other federal spending.
"
67,"People know the phrase ""the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away,"" without realizing that is true for government as well. We know that income redistribution programs like Medicare involve government taking from one group and giving it to another. But the same happens, albeit at a smaller scale, when government builds infrastructure such as a bridge over a pristine river valley.\The intent - the ""giveth"" - is to provide a ""public good,"" something necessary for society that would not be furnished by private markets. But the ""taketh away"" is that even though society as a whole gains, particular individuals and specific groups may be made worse off while others reap windfalls.\This is exemplified by the recent opening of a bridge across the St. Croix River about 15 miles east of my house. This connects Minnesota and Wisconsin. Debated for at least 30 years, the $600 million structure leaps the valley downriver from the town of Stillwater, whose scenic downtown for years endured jams of cars waiting to cross an 86-year-old two lane bridge over the river. At this level of outlay, it is a pretty major project. But similar effect occur on smaller government infrastructure projects, just at a different scale.\When contemplating a major undertaking like this, government much consider how much the proposed structure will cost society as a whole vs. what the value of all benefits will be.\Engineers are good at estimating the cash outlays. Yes, there can be cost overruns, particularly when, for example, soil or rock for foundations is not exactly what tests had indicated. But civil engineering is a pretty exact science. And a cable-stayed bridge is not a new-generation aircraft carrier.\Quantifying even the most direct benefits is a bit harder. New bridges are built to facilitate the movement of goods and people. So one can measure drive times over the old bridge and estimate what they would be with the new bridge in place. One can add up the fuel saved, reduced wear and tear on vehicles and infrastructure. More knotty is adding up the value of regained productivity from shorter commute times. This takes a few more assumptions than gasoline saved because the opportunity cost of hours of human life varies between individuals and is inherently ambiguous. It is done often enough, however, that there are accepted metrics.\Construction costs are known when the bridge is done, but travel cost savings stretch many decades into the future. The number of vehicles using the bridge probably will grow, perhaps dramatically. Past experience tells us, however, that before-the-fact estimates of transportation use are often wildly off once a few decades pass.\And then there are the potential changes to development and demographics.\The very presence of the bridge changes where population growth will occur. So in this case, it becomes not just a matter of counting people currently commuting between Wisconsin and Minnesota and assuming that this population would grow the same with or without a new bridge. Much easier transportation will motivate much more housing development than otherwise. It will motivate more commercial development. Estimating just how much will occur, however, and when, isn't easy.\But one can certainly estimate ranges and then do sensitivity analyses looking at how costs and benefits vary under many different plausible outcomes.\Once beyond the direct costs and benefits and into indirect or external ones, things get even murkier. Plunking $600 million worth of concrete and steel smack dab across one of our most beautiful rivers certainly has external costs on the environment. This is even before considering noise, exhaust and other negatives from tens of thousands of vehicles daily.\This has been the most contentious issue and one that held up construction of the bridge for decades. The St. Croix long has been designated a Federal Wild and Scenic river. As such, development within a zone that affects the river and sight lines from its surface is strictly limited. Yet at the same time, the 1965 federal act establishing this preservation system never was intended to create impenetrable barriers hundreds of miles long to all future transportation development.\This is an issue on which informed people of good will can still disagree. After years of discussion, some still think it wrong, others right.\But again, this is particularly knotty. If construction kills rainbow trout or mussels, there are accepted procedures for valuing these. But what is the social cost or benefits of an altered landscape? While some people are outraged by what they see as the desecration of a wilderness, some see a beautiful work of engineering art, perhaps not approaching famous spans like Switzerland's Salginatobel or the new Millau Viaduct France, but positive nevertheless. Others just shrug their shoulders. What is the net cost to society? Can it be put in dollars? Is that even an appropriate question?\New highways and bridges always affect economic activity, although much more in terms of where it occurs rather than the total amount produced. Gas stations and convenience stores near the new highway see business burgeon. The values of the businesses go up. Sales at similar businesses now economically marooned by closing the old route dry up and the value of the properties slump. The net change may well be positive, but while the government action increases the income or net worth of some, it decreases it for others. Losers cannot get compensation for their ruined business because what happened was not a legal ""taking"" - in the Constitutional sense - as it would be for owners of land used for actual construction. And winners have a windfall.\For this particular project, faster, cheaper commutes to the Twin Cities make the Wisconsin side of the river a more desirable place to live. So the market values of existing housing and developable land rise. Expectations trigger this even before construction begins.\With more housing available in a different state, but close to major Minnesota employers, far western metro suburbs are marginally less attractive. Effects are small, but there is slightly less construction in the western suburbs than their might have been if the St. Croix had remained a barrier. Even on the Wisconsin side there are minute changes. Fewer commuters funnel down to the existing I94 bridges, so some streets in towns on that route see less traffic and are better places to have a house, but worse ones to have a business. There are fewer customers getting a quick espresso in the morning or picking up milk and bread on the way home. And kids who have to cross a busy street to get to school are slightly safer. But these effects are reversed for counterparts along the highway that the new bridge fees onto.\Pulling even a few thousand cars off existing bridges reduces congestion by a tad for people already driving in along that axis. Minnesotans wanting to enter the freeway from our east suburbs, find waits shorter. But people who historically used the highway the new bridge feeds into were accustomed to little traffic. Now they must look for gaps to merge into.\Such myriad minor adjustments take place over multiple counties. They are so small and diffuse that few people see cause and effect.\But it was always such as development changed. Prairie towns boomed when a railroad passed through while bypassed ones withered. Famously kitschy diners and motels along old Route 66 across the American plains became nostalgic casualties of the interstate highway system. In the southwest corner of the state where I grew up, we have seen a decades-long process of bypassing Highway 60, our most important state highway, around towns instead of down their main streets. This hurt some businesses and helped others. It drove the value of some land up and that of other down. Even on a single main street, some store owners rued the loss of business from less traffic while another saw more shoppers who welcomed less traffic and easier parking.\Government acts. Some win and some lose as a result. But on the whole, government provision of key infrastructure has benefited our nation's economy. The Erie Canal, an early example of a ""public-private partnership,"" gave a cheaper outlet to products of agriculture and commerce from thousands of square miles. Whigs like Henry Clay and Abraham Lincoln were right about the need for ""public improvements."" Transcontinental railroads, highly subsidized by government, opened even more opportunities, as did the interstate highways of the '50s and '60s.\I think that we have been underinvesting in infrastructure and living by depreciating out the investments of our ancestors. Some politicians give lip-service agreement. But we cannot raise a 23-year-old federal gas tax, oh no. That would hurt the economy.\St. Paul economist and writer Edward Lotterman can be reached at stpaul@edlotterman.com."
