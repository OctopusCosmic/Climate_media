0,"Cap and trade is one subject the Republican gubernatorial candidates won't be arguing about.\All four Republican candidates denounced the federal legislation in a joint news release issued last week, a rare occurrence in which dueling politicians join forces.\In this case, their common foe has been universally denounced by Republicans in South Dakota. The clean energy bill is pending in a Senate committee, and critics say it would drive up the costs of energy for consumers. The legislation caps emissions on greenhouse gases and establishes a trading system in which industries can buy allowances on the open market to exceed their caps.\Lt. Gov. Dennis Daugaard, Senate Majority Leader Dave Knudson, former Brookings Mayor Scott Munsterman and rancher Ken Knuppe all say the bill would be bad for the state.\""This legislation would burden U.S. farmers and ranchers; consumers will be forced to pay more for the same goods and services they are getting now,"" Knuppe said.\Dusty Johnson, chairman of the Public Utilities Commission, testified against the measure this week in Washington and sparred with California Sen. Barbara Boxer on the issue. Boxer, whose committee is hearing the legislation, is a Democrat and a sponsor of the bill.\While Johnson argued that steps need to be taken to deal with climate change, he testified that the bill would have a disproportionate effect on consumers in the Midwest. Officials in the energy business estimate that utility bills could go up 41 percent by 2015.\Supporters of the measure say it has plenty of good things for South Dakota besides being good for the environment. The bill promotes the use of alternative industries, including wind. That could be a boon for the state.\Opposition to cap and trade among Republicans has been spearheaded by state Rep. Dan Lederman of Dakota Dunes.\Lederman was out of the country last week. His aide, Craig Dewey, said Lederman has strong feelings on the subject.\""The economic impact would be very big in raising prices,"" Dewey said. ""It essentially amounts to a tax increase, especially at a time when the economy is soft.""\Reach Jonathan Ellis at 575-3629."
1,"The policy under dispute, cap-and-trade, dates back to the late 1980s and last was a heated topic of debate in 2009. It emerged as a proposed solution to sulfur dioxide emissions, which were causing acid rain.\It was proposed by the Environmental Defense Fund as a replacement for traditional environmental regulations in which the government would ""tell companies how to pollute less,"" said Keith Gaby, communications director for the defense fund's climate and air program.\""In the late 1980s, our organization, working with the Bush administration, came up with a new approach to give businesses more flexibility -- to say, what the government and society cares about is less pollution, so let's let the free market determine how to get there,"" Gaby said.\Under cap-and-trade, the government sets an overall cap on the amount of a particular pollutant that companies are allowed to emit. Then it either gives away or sells permits to pollute up to that cap. Companies with low pollution can profit from this by selling their emissions permits to heavier polluters. Meanwhile, factories or power plants may buy emissions permits instead of making expensive alterations to infrastructure.\The market sets the price of those emissions. Companies such as Natsource are involved in the trading. Most of the papers by U.S. House challenger Matt Varilek, a Democrat, focused on predictions of those permit prices and how different decisions by governments in setting up a cap-and-trade system affect them.\Cap-and-trade systems do raise the cost of the pollutants they cap, something supporters acknowledge and opponents highlight.\Myron Ebell, director of the Center for Energy and the Environment at the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute, called cap-and-trade a political attempt to make environmental regulations look good.\""People will not change their energy use unless they're charged more for energy. The key to cap-and-trade working is that it will cause higher energy prices,"" Ebell said.\He compared cap-and-trade to an alternative method of raising the price of pollution: taxing it.\""The only beneficiaries of a carbon tax are those who produce alternative forms of energy,"" Ebell said.\The first cap-and-trade system, for sulfur dioxide, is largely considered a success, with sulfur levels dramatically reduced and lower-than-expected costs for companies. Ebell, however, argued most of this benefit was because of railroad deregulation making it cheaper to ship low-sulfur coal from Wyoming.\Since the mid-1990s, environmentalists and policymakers have tried to create cap-and-trade systems dealing with emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that a scientific consensus says is contributing to climate change. In 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade program, but it died in the Senate.\David Owen, the president of the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said cap-and-trade programs called the 2009 version ""godawful and too expensive.""\He argued many environmental regulations are worth the extra cost to the economy, as long as they find ""a balancing point."" Cap-and-trade programs for carbon dioxide, Owen said, aren't at that point yet.\Both supporters and opponents don't expect cap-and-trade to be seriously proposed in the United States in the near future.\""Cap-and-trade, we know that's not happening any time soon,"" Gaby said.\Republican Rep. Kristi Noem opposes a carbon tax as well as cap-and-trade. Varilek also said he opposes a carbon tax.\He said he prefers programs to promote wind energy, rather than to penalize fuels such as coal and natural gas, as the best path to address climate change."
2,"In the government's fight to harness global warming, the gain is in the pain.\At its core, climate legislation will drive up the cost of electricity from carbon-based fuels, namely coal. That will force conservation - energy efficiency through consumer sacrifice.\""That's part of the impacts on controlling greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Jamie Van Nostrand, executive director of the Energy and Climate Center at the Pace Law School in White Plains, N.Y. ""But if people use less, they become more energy-efficient, their bills are not going to go up. They're going to do things perpetually that will actually lower their bills. I think that's an element of this legislation.""\Coal is central to the debate about a cap-and-trade system in the Midwest, since the region gets much of its electricity from coal-fired power plants. And the plants belch out carbon dioxide, a leading greenhouse gas.\A cap-and-trade system would be created to reduce emissions. Utilities would have to buy government-issued pollution permits. The cost of buying offsets probably would be passed onto the public.\There are ways to prepare for a cap-and-trade system now, Van Nostrand said.\Buy more efficient appliances. Weatherize. Switch to compact fluorescent light bulbs.\That's not always easy, especially if you're just starting out in your first home. Energy-efficient appliances cost more, with the promise of reduced electric bills.\The federal stimulus package provides small tax rebates for buying EnergyStar appliances. It provides larger tax breaks for installing eco-friendly geothermal heating and cooling systems or wind turbines.\It even helps low-income families weatherize their homes.\More than $24 million has been pumped into the state to help low-income families reduce their home energy costs, including installing insulation, caulking or replacing windows and weather-stripping doors.\""We're still trying to get the word out,"" said Scott Finck, weatherization program director of the Inter-Lakes Community Action Partnership, which oversees the federal program in eastern South Dakota. ""We're finding that people are saving 15 to 20 percent on their energy costs, some as much as half on their fuel bills. Obviously, that's huge. And that savings helps the public and affects the environment.""\You just have to know where the electricity goes in your home.\Your refrigerator sucks up 14 percent of all the juice, and appliances such as the microwave, computer and oven account for 65 percent of home electrical use.\""Cap-and-trade is a huge issue,"" said Tom Johnson, manager of Karl's TV, Audio, Appliances & Furniture in Sioux Falls. ""But so is energy efficiency. Everything's going green. People don't realize that there are things they can do now to save a huge amount of money.""\Johnson said that two years ago, he replaced his old washer with front-loading model that uses half the water and spins the clothes nearly dry - so his new dryer doesn't work as hard.\""Our electric bills dropped $32 a month and the gas dropped $16,"" he said. ""And we didn't do anything else. It all pointed to the washer and dryer.""\The House version of the American Clean Energy and Security Act calls for new energy-efficiency standards for lighting, appliances, furnaces and buildings. Homeowners would be able to get up to $3,000 in financial help to make their homes 20 percent more efficient. There also would be financial incentives for commercial properties.\The idea is for people to adjust their habits now ahead of any climate legislation.\""Look, if people just replaced their beer fridge in the garage with a newer one, they could go from sucking $250 a year to $60 a year,"" Johnson said. ""People can save money in the short term and the long term on energy efficiency. And there's always new technology coming down the road.""\More online: The U.S. Department of Energy has money-saving energy tips online at www.energysavers.gov.\For guidelines on weatherization assistance, visit: http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/weatherization."
3,"Herseth Sandlin in middle of climate debate\BY PETER HARRIMAN\pharrima@argusleader.com\At a Sioux Falls Live Earth concert earlier this month, Greenpeace officials focused on one member of South Dakota's congressional delegation: Stephanie Herseth Sandlin.\""We believe she does have great leadership potential, and ultimately, we think she'll be a champion on global warming,"" said Ferale Hubbard, a local Greenpeace staff member, at the event.\The group's interest in Herseth Sandlin makes sense.\Her role on committees, including the House Agriculture and Natural Resources Committees and the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, makes her well-placed to be a key player as the U.S. reaches for a coherent policy on challenges such as finding abundant, affordable, clean energy.\However, as a representative of an ag-dependent state, she finds herself on the opposite side of many environmentalists on issues important to farmers, such as crop subsidies.\Herseth Sandlin has exchanged views with European leaders on World Trade Organization agriculture negotiations, and she participated in the select committee's trip to Greenland, Germany and Belgium this summer to discuss climate change. She also is an eloquent advocate for her positions.\""She's seen as a rising star in this intersection of issues,"" Ken Cook said. He is director of the Environmental Working Group, a Washington, D.C., policy analysis and environmental advocacy organization that has not always agreed with Herseth Sandlin on the way federal money is allocated to farm country.\""She has made herself an expert on these issues. In the Congress, expertise is often more important than committee placement,"" said John Davidson, emeritus water law professor at the University of South Dakota and a longtime environmental advocate. He has fundamental differences with Herseth Sandlin on her ardent support of federal ethanol subsidies.\Ag part of answer\For her part, Herseth Sandlin sees her role as making sure agriculture is part of the answer in a new model for energy and climate policy.\""The most important thing ... is to make sure that agriculture and rural America don't get bypassed, that there is someone on the committees on my side of the aisle watching out for agriculture and rural interests,"" she said.\Herseth Sandlin was one of three Democrats on the Natural Resources Committee to vote against an energy bill, because ""it reflects a lack of understanding how agricultural economies work, how heavily dependent they are on natural gas, especially for nitrogen fertilizer,"" she said.\She also has made the case for biofuels and wind power and has pushed for a ""cap and trade system"" to allow industries that emit significant amounts of carbon, such as coal-fired power plants, to pay farmers to sequester carbon in plant fiber.\Greenpeace praised Herseth Sandlin last week for backing a House resolution, the Udall-Platts Renewable Electricity Standard, that calls for increasing renewable energy use 20 percent by 2020. It would allow power companies to receive credits for electricity produced from wind, the sun, crops and other renewable resources.\Ethanol supporter\The most serendipitous development in South Dakota agriculture in the past decade is ethanol, an industry with a $1 billion effect on South Dakota's economy, according to a study commissioned by the South Dakota Corn Growers.\Herseth Sandlin has supported ethanol since she first ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2002.\Brian Jennings, executive director of the American Coalition for Ethanol, said Herseth Sandlin's committee assignments ""position her very well to tackle the challenges and opportunities our industry is facing.""\There is ""an increasing drumbeat in Washington,"" he said, as to how clean-burning biofuels can ""help us meet the most pressing climate change issues.""\Herseth Sandlin's support for ethanol doesn't sit well with Davidson. ""I've said over and over, show me a subsidy, and more likely than not, you'll find harm to the environment.""\Tony Dean, a Pierre outdoors writer and broadcaster and conservation activist, said the explosive growth of ethanol has converted grassland to cornfields. ""Every time a plow turns the soil, we release carbon. It ties directly to global warming.""\Cook said he thinks Herseth Sandlin is trying to traverse this tricky landscape in a way that balances environmental and agricultural goals. ""She's certainly one of the more articulate, thoughtful people out there trying to pull these things together,"" he said.\Notwithstanding her enthusiasm for growing the biofuels industry, Dean said, Herseth Sandlin supports Sodsaver legislation to preserve grasslands.\Change comes slowly\In the near term, Jennings, Cook and Dean predict incremental change rather than sweeping new policy initiatives in Congress. Herseth Sandlin herself said with regard to a new farm bill, ""You don't want to radically overhaul the framework unless you have a better sense short-term trends are going to become long-term trends.""\The role of the select committee, she adds, will be to set the stage for legislation that might not be adopted for years.\Also, because President Bush has so little remaining political capital, it is difficult for the White House to lead Congress to common ground on climate issues.\But she predicts this: ""I hope we can make some progress this fall in the Energy and Commerce Committee. If that does not happen, I anticipate these issues will be focal points in the (2008) presidential election.""\AT ISSUE\BALANCE: Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, D-S.D., must weigh the competing interests of farmers and environmentalists when helping to develop energy policy."
4,"Varilek\Matt Varilek's past as an analyst on environmental issues is under fire as he tries to unseat Rep. Kristi Noem.\The incumbent Republican has dug up Varilek's past work and writing and argues that it betrays support for ""radical environmental policies.""\Varilek, in turn, insists his approach to the environment is ""how can we grow our economy (simultaneously) and protect clean air and clean water""?\The perception could profoundly influence the election.\Noem's campaign is focused on attacking what it describes as Varilek's environmental radicalism. Radio and Internet ads talk about ""Varilek's radical energy tax"" and the harm it would cause to families and farmers.\At the heart of the ads is cap-and-trade, a strategy for lowering pollutants that was heavily discussed in 2009 as a way to tackle climate change. Cap-and-trade sets an overall limit for emissions of a pollutant, then lets companies buy and sell emissions permits to comply with the limit.\Varilek said he doesn't support implementing a cap-and-trade system to deal with carbon dioxide emissions, as Noem claims.\""I have not supported legislation to establish such a system, and I do not now,"" Varilek said.\Noem said that's not true.\""Clearly, if you look at his background, he has devoted years to the promotion of a cap-and-trade scheme,"" Noem said.\Environmental interest stoked\That background stretches back to 1993, when Varilek graduated from Yankton High School and went off to study at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn. During his four years there, Varilek majored in philosophy and pursued a minor in environment and technology studies.\""I care about clean air and clean water, like a lot of people do,"" he said.\After graduating, Varilek pursued his interest in the environment by taking a job as a teaching assistant for Columbia University at the Biosphere 2 facility in Arizona. The research center was the subject of controversy in the early 1990s when two long-term scientific experiments involving subjects living inside the Biosphere 2 collapsed amid miscalculations and infighting by researchers.\By the time Varilek arrived in 1997, Columbia University had taken over management of the facility and was host to less ambitious classes and experiments there.\Varilek taught environmental policy to Columbia undergrads at the Biosphere 2 for a year before earning a scholarship to study abroad at Glasgow University in Scotland.\There he studied for a master's degree in economic development. Along with the environment and politics, that would dominate Varilek's career.\Later, in between work in the private sector at a company called Natsource, Varilek returned to Great Britain for a second master's degree at Cambridge University, this one in environment and development.\Varilek said over his life, that's been the focus of his environmentalism -- how to ""tackle these natural resource questions and grow your economy simultaneously.""\The Noem campaign's ads accusing Varilek of supporting a cap-and-trade system highlight the predictions of critics about how such a system would increase food and energy costs.\Today, Varilek said ""we have much better options"" than cap-and-trade to address climate change.\""I believe climate change is real and that we should tackle it in ways that help to grow the economy,"" he said.\Noem said she's not convinced climate change is happening, and doesn't think it's the main issue.\""As far as global warming, I don't believe there's consensus on that issue. Obviously, the climate and weather are constantly changing,"" Noem said. ""The debate isn't on the weather, it's on the size and role of government and the cap-and-tax scheme.""\Cap-and-tax is a derisive description of cap-and-trade by its opponents.\Wrote cap-and-trade papers a decade ago\The focus of Noem's attack of Varilek for allegedly supporting cap-and-trade is on Varilek's three-plus years at Natsource, both out of its New York City and Washington, D.C., offices. Natsource, an energy brokerage, worked with clients who wanted to trade contracts related to energy. This included trading permits to emit sulfur dioxide under the original 1990s sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade program, generally considered a success. By the time Varilek arrived in 1999, the company also was starting work involving emissions permits for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.\Varilek said his work for Natsource was as an analyst.\""My job was to understand the dynamics in those markets and provide that analysis to various clients,"" Varilek said. He would ""analyze the different ways that the rules of the game impact the market -- if you design it this way, it will have this impact on the market.""\In 2001 and 2002, Varilek co-wrote papers about cap-and-trade systems for Natsource -- papers Noem's campaign discovered and is circulating.\""He wrote extensively about cap and trade, he worked for a company that lobbied for it, and he spent years writing about it,"" Noem said.\Varilek said those papers were about understanding how those cap-and-trade systems work.\""On the question of trading systems, I analyzed them and the markets for those instruments, but was not advocating for them,"" he said.\Analysis rather than outright advocacy\An Argus Leader review of some of those papers, provided by the Noem campaign, largely supports Varilek's contention that he was engaging in analysis, rather than urging adoption of cap-and-trade systems. The papers never approach cap-and-trade from a hostile perspective, and sometimes take a positive tone about the system.\One paper predicted how changing laws around the world would affect prices for greenhouse gas emissions permits. Another took a more general look at cap-and-trade systems existing at the time, how they could evolve in the future and how private companies would be affected under various systems. All the papers were co-written with other individuals.\The papers acknowledged costs involved in cap-and-trade systems, noting in one potential ""significant economic consequences, including potential changes in absolute levels or wealth as well as transfers of existing wealth."" But the cost to emitters of pollutants of complying with the system -- emphasized by cap-and-trade foes-- was not a focus of the papers.\The primary tone of the papers was neutral, but they occasionally talked about cap-and-trade systems in a positive tone. One paper, talking about the successful, bipartisan sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade program of the 1990s, called it ""the most compelling empirical evidence to date of the environmental and economic benefits of emissions trading.""\Neutral to positive in tone, Varilek says\A website put up by the Noem campaign, capandtaxmatt.com, features quotes from those papers. Many of the quotes are from definitions sections where Varilek and his co-authors describe how a cap-and-trade system functions. Others are areas where the authors adopt a positive tone, talking about ""significant benefits"" and ""positive environmental and economic results.""\Varilek didn't dispute a characterization of his writings as neutral-to-positive in tone about cap-and-trade.\""It's in the analytical mode, and part of the analysis is acknowledging costs and benefits of the system,"" Varilek said. ""The fact that it's analytical and sometimes fits in a positive direction ... and on that basis the opposing campaign is saying that as a congressman he would support a particular legislation, is such a logical stretch.""\Varilek's Kyoto speech scrutinized\Aside from Varilek's papers, Noem accused Varilek of supporting the 1990s Kyoto Protocol, an international attempt to set up a cap-and-trade system to deal with greenhouse gases. Her campaign pointed to Varilek's participation in a U.N. conference on the Kyoto Protocol in 2001 in Marrakech, Morocco, where he spoke.\Varilek said he doesn't support the Kyoto Protocol. He said he attended the Morocco conference ""to provide a private sector perspective on these markets and their design.""\Noem said Varilek couldn't work intimately with cap-and-trade systems for years and not be in favor -- unless, she said, he isn't a person who holds strong beliefs.\""Either he's not telling the truth, or he lacks conviction,"" Noem said. ""There's already enough people in Washington, D.C., who don't tell the truth and don't stand for something, and we don't need more.""\In turn, Varilek accused Noem of trying to change the subject away from her record.\""She's just making false assertions and hoping that people will ignore the evidence in order to change the topic,"" he said.\ONLINE\DOCUMENTS: Public policy papers about greenhouse gases\100 EYES: Join the talk at 3 p.m. each Tuesday with ""100 Eyes on S.D.

5,"Judy Miiller of Mitchell wants to do right by the environment.\It's not that simple.\Her daughter, Trisha, is buying her first place in Sioux Falls and needs all her appliances, which account for almost 65 percent of all electricity used in the home. In a tumultuous economy, on a budget, it's not easy to spend the extra money on energy efficiency for a promise of savings down the road.\But reining in greenhouse gases globally could end up costing the Miiller's - and everyone else in the state - an extra $38 a month in higher electric bills.\It's but one possible consequence for South Dakotans in the discussion about the American Clean Energy and Security Act, the landmark climate legislation being considered by Congress. A major piece of the bill, a cap-and-trade system on emissions, would raise the cost of carbon-based energy such as coal, thus forcing people to conserve.\""I think it's important to save when you can,"" Judy Miiller said. ""But we also need to work within a budget. She's on a strict budget. If we can do it, fit it within the budget, then we'll go for it.""\The Senate won't get serious on climate legislation until late fall. But the version passed in the House of Representatives has sections important to the state, including:\Require utilities to produce ever-increasing percentages of electricity from renewable sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and biofuels.\Pay farmers to use methods that capture carbon in the soil. They could see an annual net return of $15 billion to $20 billion by 2040, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\Allow new coal plants, such as the proposed Big Stone II plant near Milbank, to be built through 2020. But they would be required to adopt the latest technologies in carbon capture and sequestration. By 2025, all coal plants built after 2009 would capture 50 percent of their carbon emissions.\Push ""smart grid"" technology to build a better transmission infrastructure. This is crucial for getting wind-generated energy out of South Dakota.\'A market-based solution to a global problem'\""People tend to get stuck on cap-and-trade, or what it is going to do - or not do - to energy bills,"" said Matt McLarty, South Dakota policy advocate with the Environmental Law & Policy Center, a Chicago-based environmental and economic development advocacy organization. ""There's so much more to this bill than capturing carbon. This is about creating a new industry, a new way to power America. It's not the government coming in and creating a tax. It's a market-based solution to a global problem.""\Still, the legislation continues to draw attention to its cap-and-trade element, since studies confirm that utility rates will increase. And that's what the opposition is counting on to sway Americans against the measure.\""I think increased energy costs are very certain and the environmental benefits are very uncertain,"" said Phil Kerpen, director of policy with Americans for Prosperity, a Washington D.C.-based grass-roots economic policy advocacy group. ""It's all pain and potentially no gain. That's why you've seen environmental groups come out against it as well.""\The bill would set government limits on pollutants released into the air, initiating the cap. It then then let industries that emit greenhouse gases into the air, such as factories and utilities, to buy credits, creating the trade. The goal is to decrease greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent and drop global temperatures by 3.6 degrees by 2050.\Proponents, including President Obama, say the legislation is the lowest-cost solution to ease global warming, it will force people to conserve energy and spur new, green energy technologies and jobs.\Opponents say cap-and-trade merely is a national tax on energy that will burden all Americans and kill jobs.\Call it a tax or a green revolution, the cap-and-trade system is a philosophical, practical and political beast that will affect South Dakotans - and the rest of the world.\Herseth Sandlin supports goal but says economic risk too high\The House passed its version of the bill in late June, 219-212. Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, D-S.D., voted no.\Herseth Sandlin joined 44 other Democrats in voting against the measure, saying she strongly supported the bill's goal to reduce the pollution blamed for global warming. But she said it didn't go far enough to protect the state's economy.\""Given the complexity both of the climate change problem and the steps needed to address it, we need to take time to get it right,"" she said after the vote. ""The stakes are simply too high for a rushed solution that can potentially create more problems than it solves.""\The Senate has just began to formulate its version and any vote is months away.\But in June, the Senate Energy Committee passed the American Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009, which could be a precursor to a final bill. That legislation would expand energy development in the state and increase production of low-cost electricity.\""Federal policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions must be flexible and let the market drive new technologies,"" said Sen. Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat who serves on the committee. ""We need policies that incentivize clean energy production. That means more biofuels and the enactment of a Renewable Electricity Standard to increase demand for wind energy just like the Renewable Fuel Standard boosted demand for ethanol.""\State's cost disproportionate in cap-and-trade, Thune says\Whether the massive climate bill gets passed - the first hearings on cap-and-trade are scheduled for September - will be done so over the loud and persistent voices of senators from mostly rural states. Much resistance will come from South Dakota's Sen. John Thune, a rising star in the Republican Party and proponent of the state's wind and biofuel industries.\""I'd certainly like to see a different approach to the issue,"" Thune said. ""My thoughts are to use incentives rather than mandates to drive this. Use a carrot rather than a stick. And there has to be real discussion on regional disparities as to the cost.""\Under a cap-and-trade system, South Dakotans will get stung with increased energy costs. The state gets almost 47 percent of its electricity from coal.\""For me, the mandate approach shows that the costs are real,"" Thune said. ""But the benefits are very much less clear.""\One area where the state could make gains is in offsets. Farmers who use no-till practices, add methane digesters, plant trees and set aside marginal lands from crop production could make money by selling credits on the open market.\Add the state's burgeoning wind industry, proponents say, and South Dakota comes out a winner in helping solve global warming.\""If it's implemented wisely, a cap-and-trade system would put more money into the pockets of South Dakota's farmers and ranchers,"" South Dakota Farmers Union president Doug Sombke said.\""Agricultural producers all over the country have a huge opportunity here to increase their incomes and help the environment at the same time.""\South Dakota farmers and ranchers were paid more than $1.5 million in 2008 through the South Dakota Farmers Union's voluntary offset program through the Chicago Climate Exchange.\""I think it's a good deal, I'm happy to be involved,"" said Paul Hettinger of White Lake, who has 800 acres enrolled, and made $2,000 last year on carbon credits for no-till farming. ""I really didn't change anything, I'm just doing what I've always done. Just filled out some forms and that was it.""\Other farm groups, including the American Farm Bureau, as less enthusiastic about offsets. Officials say studies fail to calculate real losses to farmers past 2020.\""Inclusion of an offset program is not the complete answer,"" American Farm Bureau president Bob Stallman told senators in July. ""Even with a robust agricultural offset program, the bill still does not make economic sense for producers.""\Not all dairies can set up a methane digester. Not every farmer can use no-till, plant trees or set up a small wind farm.\""Yet these producers will incur the same increased fuel, fertilizer and energy costs as their counterparts who can benefit from the offsets market,"" he said.\Rising costs are at the heart of the cap-and-trade debate.\In addition to the federal studies, there are estimates from universities and utility companies. The figures swing wildly from the cost of a postage stamp a day to $1,300 a year for the typical household.\South Dakotans could see their monthly electric bill rise from $80 to $118.40, or 48 percent, by 2015, according to a South Dakota Public Utilities Commission study.\""The costs are going to be tremendous, not only for electricity, but gasoline and natural gas as well,"" Kerpen said.\According to a report released last week by the Energy Information Association, the House version of the bill would increase household energy costs by $134 a year in 2020 and $339 by 2030. The report also found gasoline rising by 20 cents a gallon in 2020 and 35 cents a gallon in 2030.\""People pay bills, they don't pay rates,"" said Jamie Van Nostrand, executive director of the Energy and Climate Center at the Pace Law School in White Plains, N.Y.

6,"HOWARD - This eastern South Dakota community is humming even before the autumn sun rises.\Surrounded by fields of beans, corn, flax and prairie grasses, Howard is banking on a new crop: wind. It's already delivered dozens of new jobs through two local plants, one of which builds blades for energy-producing wind turbines, and another that repairs and remakes turbine components such as gearboxes, blades and brake stations.\In March, the town's rural learning center is starting a program that will train residents to become wind-machine technicians.\It wasn't long ago that this city of about 1,000 people was withering. People who did not want to farm were leaving for better jobs. Now, the same winter winds that can make life on the Great Plains harsh are breathing new life into the community. Homes are being built, tax revenues are growing and the local supermarket is among the businesses benefiting from Howard's new industry, which has brought about 80 jobs that start around $13.50 an hour, according to Mayor Don Arens.\""It's made a big difference here in town,"" Arens, a grain broker, said. ""There was nothing here to hold the younger generation around, but now we're getting these other industries going. Knock on wood, it's going to bring a lot of 'em back to Howard.""\Jobs have emerged as an increasingly important issue in the congressional clatter about climate change.\Supporters of a cap-and-trade system being debated on Capitol Hill predict that almost 2 million jobs would be created as the country shifts from polluting fossil fuels to alternative energy sources such as wind. Under cap and trade, energy producers that exceed emissions caps would pay extra under a market-driven system that determines prices.\With equal fervor, cap-and-trade opponents predict that the program will cost 2 million jobs as emission restrictions drive up the cost of energy for businesses, which they say will have little choice but to lay off workers.\""It seems that the debate over jobs and the environment has been around about as long as we have had either jobs or an environment,"" Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., said during a hearing last week examining the effect of cap and trade on the economy.\Part of that debate centers on the assumptions made when calculating the effect on jobs: What will the final legislation look like? What exactly is a ""green"" job? How much blame should be assigned to environmental regulations when jobs are eliminated?\The math remains fuzzy for South Dakota as well.\A University of California study released last month projected that the climate-change bill authored by Senate Democrats Barbara Boxer of California and John Kerry of Massachusetts would provide South Dakota about 10,000 jobs by 2020.\Conversely, a report in August from the American Council for Capital Formation and the National Association of Manufacturers analyzing a similar though slightly less ambitious cap-and-trade bill that narrowly passed the House this summer predicts the loss of up to 8,740 jobs in the state by 2030.\Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, D-S.D., voted against that bill, saying that it could lead to dramatic rate increases for South Dakota utility customers and that it does not go far enough in expanding the definition of renewable energy.\The full Senate has yet to vote on its version. Sen. John Thune, R-.D., calls it a ""jobs killer,"" while Sen. Tim Johnson has said he's interested in doing something to halt global warming and is flexible on the details.\Herseth Sandlin, Thune and Johnson all worry about the Senate bill's effect on farming, a carbon-intensive industry with generally low profit margins.\For both sides of the debate, the example in the community of Howard is instructive.\Legislation that would speed up America's search for renewable fuels, such as solar and wind power, should help a state that boasts the nation's fourth-largest supply of wind energy potential. But uncertainty about the climate change bill and its costs also was blamed for the decision this month not to build the Big Stone II coal-fired power plant near Milbank, which would have provided needed transmission capacity to move wind-generated energy to other parts of the country.\Some of the concerns that stoke support for a climate-change bill - environmental degradation, reliance on foreign oil, global competition - are pushing expansion of renewable fuels as well. But those steps are being taken because of economic opportunity, not because of anything Congress has done or is planning to do to combat global warming, said Steve Wegman, executive director of the South Dakota Wind Energy Association.\Six years ago, Wegman said, the state had three jobs in the wind industry. Today there are more than 1,000 - and more are on the way. For rural communities dependent almost entirely on agriculture, wind provides, as Howard found out, a chance to survive by diversifying the local economy and attracting workers looking for more than just farming.\""This is our chance to bring good jobs to rural America,"" Wegman said. ""You're not going to build a Ford Motor Company here. We're not going to have Philips Lighting building a manufacturing plant here. We've got to have diversity in the economy. No economy can sustain life on a single industry.""\Contact Ledyard King at lking@gannett.com."
7,"Sen. John Thune said Wednesday a climate change bill working its way through the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is bad for South Dakota.\The South Dakota Republican, a vocal critic of energy legislation backed by Democrats, told reporters in a conference call Wednesday that the Senate ""cap-and-trade"" legislation would be even worse than a House climate change measure because it would be more aggressive in capping carbon emissions.\That would hurt South Dakota in the form of higher electricity costs for energy-intensive agricultural operations and because the state relies heavily on carbon-producing coal for its electricity.\""Embarking on this path right now with the economy as fragile as it is could do great harm,"" Thune said. ""We ought to be doing everything we can to reduce emissions and go to carbon-free energy sources, but I think there are ways we can do that with incentives rather than with this heavy-handed, top-down mandate which puts these crushing new energy costs on the American economy and American families when they're struggling to get back on their feet.""\Contact Ledyard King at lking@gannett.com.\'Embarking on this path right now with the economy as fragile as it is could do great harm.'\Sen.

8,"Roland Rosenbaum is frustrated about the direction the country is heading.\""I'm frustrated with the whole administration taking away our freedoms and spending all our money,"" he said.\Rosenbaum, 79, of Elk Point, came to the W.H. Lyon Fairgrounds in Sioux Falls with his wife to listen to speakers caution about what they say will hurt American households through electricity and natural gas price hikes if President Obama's proposed cap-and-trade legislation to control pollution and encourage alternative energy goes through. About 40 people turned out for the Wednesday morning event.\""They're using the environment as an excuse to gain more control,"" Rosenbaum said. ""And now I feel like people aren't paying attention to this.""\A hot-air balloon with the words ""Cap and trade means lost jobs, higher taxes, less freedom"" was visible behind the podium. It represented the Hot Air Tour, backed by Americans for Prosperity, a free-market advocacy group whose members say they want to expose ""a scheme that is nothing more than a tax on energy."" The tour stopped in several parts of the United States, stopping Tuesday in Fargo and setting up today in Omaha.\Under the cap-and-trade measure, energy producers would be limited on the amount of greenhouse gas they could emit. If a company went over the limit, it would have to buy or trade credits with companies that were under the limit. The proposal calls for cutting greenhouse gases by 17 percent during the next decade. The system could drive up costs for residential customers by as much as 41 percent by 2015, according to a report released by the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission.\Tim Phillips, AFP president, spoke to the group.\If energy becomes more expensive, jobs will be lost, he said.\""We're going to see unemployment creeping up if this passes,"" Phillips said.\The main targets were Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin and Sen. Tim Johnson. Cap-and-trade legislation could be voted on in the U.S. House of Representatives as early as this week and, if it passes, it is expected to reach the Senate after Labor Day.\Phillips announced the phone numbers for Herseth Sandlin's offices in South Dakota and Washington, D.C.\""Take out your cell phone and urge her to vote against this,"" he said. Callers in the crowd gave thumbs up signs as their messages went through.\Organizers handed out literature pieces with tear sheets to be mailed to Johnson that ask him to oppose the legislation. Phillips said the goal is to have South Dakota residents mail 10,000 petitions to Johnson's office.\Sen. John Thune has said he is against cap-and-trade legislation. Herseth Sandlin has said she will vote against the bill unless there are major changes, and Johnson hasn't said how he will vote.\Lora Hubbel, 51, of Sioux Falls, said she attended the protest because she thinks people are being misled about the science behind global warming.\""They're using bad science that only depends on money and politics,"" she said.\""We're only hearing about research from a few scientists. ... I wish more common sense was used."""
9,"EPA plan would relax regulations on installing anti-pollution equipment\BY BEN SHOUSE\bshouse@argusleader.com\South Dakota has a stake in two major changes to air-pollution rules recently proposed by the Bush administration.\The changes, part of the president's Clear Skies Initiative, would reduce pollution, but not quickly enough for critics.\A version of the initiative is stalled in Congress, but the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed several new rules that mirror the legislation.\The first proposal would change a Clean Air Act rule requiring owners of new pollution sources to install modern equipment. It would cover fewer sources than current rules, and 14 states have sued to delay the change.\The South Dakota attorney general's office wants to intervene in court in favor of the changes.\""The big impact on South Dakota is the cost of our heat and our power,"" said Roxanne Diedd, the assistant attorney general handling the state's case.\The second proposed change, leaked to the media Tuesday and still unofficial, would change how EPA regulates mercury, a neurotoxin that humans get mostly from fish. It would reduce emissions, but not as quickly as an earlier administration plan.\Fish from three South Dakota lakes - Twin Lakes, Bitter Lake and Lake Isabel - contain mercury above the EPA threshold. These and other contaminated fish pose a risk of birth defects when eaten by pregnant women.\The proposed rule would reduce mercury emissions more slowly than the administration had previously planned.\And instead of requiring the best pollution-prevention technology everywhere, it would introduce a ""cap and trade"" system, giving industry more flexibility.\Plants unable to meet the required reductions could buy emission allowances from other plants that have exceeded the required cuts.\""The preliminary EPA proposal is very weak,"" said Andy Buchsbaum of the National Wildlife Federation in Ann Arbor, Mich. He said cap and trade is not a bad idea, but the emissions goal is not ambitious enough.\The proposal would limit mercury emissions nationwide to 34 tons a year by 2010, which is 30 percent below current levels but falls short of the 26-ton limit originally proposed by the Bush administration.\Kyrik Rombough of the state Department of Environment and Natural Resources said it is unclear whether the new plan would reduce the risk to South Dakota. But he said a cap and trade system has already proved effective against acid rain.\The only other law to address acid rain is the ""new source review"" provision of the Clean Air Act, which requires power plants and other pollution producers to install anti-pollution devices when they make equipment changes. It has not been as effective as cap and trade, he said.\The EPA's other rule change, proposed in August, would clarify when new source review applies. The Bush administration and industry representatives say that is currently unclear, preventing routine maintenance that could reduce pollution.\The proposal allows companies to make changes without triggering new source review if they do not alter equipment design or cost more than one-fifth the value of the equipment.\Rombough said that would not increase pollution.\""If they would make any change that would increase emissions, they would have to go through new source review,"" he said.\But David McIntosh of the Washington-based Natural Resources Defense Council disagrees. Many air-quality permits have limits that are well above actual emissions, he said, so polluters could increase emissions without triggering review.\Xcel Energy's Angus Anson power plant in Sioux Falls, for example, emits only 1.8 percent of its permitted amount, a spokesman said. However, that is not likely to be the case with the state's largest emitter of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, Otter Tail Power Co.'s coal plant in Big Stone City, a spokesperson said.\The plant releases about 15,000 tons of nitrogen oxides, 12,000 tons of sulfur dioxide and about 260 pounds of mercury per year. But neither the Department of Energy and Natural Resources nor the company could immediately say what the plant's permitted levels of emissions are.\Critics say the Bush initiative falls short of its potential.\""I think the administration missed a big opportunity,"" said Robert Stavins, an environmental economist at Harvard University. He said EPA should phase out new source review in favor of a larger cap-and-trade system.\""The advantage of cap and trade is that you can lower overall cost to consumers,"" he said.\But the argument is now so clouded by politics, he said, that a more effective change is unlikely in the near future.\Argus Leader wire services contributed to this report. Reach Ben Shouse at 331-2318.\What does it mean?\If new EPA air-pollution proposals take effect:\[section] Power plants and other facilities could replace or repair equipment without triggering stringent air-quality rules.\[section] Mercury limits would be looser than under an earlier plan, and companies could buy and sell the right to emit the neurotoxin."
10,"South Dakota this week joined 14 other states and a coalition of interest groups in a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency's finding that it can regulate emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide because of the threat they pose to public health.\The EPA's Dec. 15 endangerment finding stated that carbon dioxide is enough of a hazard to human health that it can be restricted under the Clean Air Act.\If the EPA uses its authority to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant, state Attorney General Marty Jackley said, the economic damage to small businesses in South Dakota would be devastating.\President Obama, along with environmental groups and some farmers in South Dakota, have said that a cap-and-trade system to regulate carbon dioxide is preferable to EPA rule-making. But if Congress doesn't pass cap-and-trade legislation, more than 1,000 small facilities in South Dakota could be required to obtain permits from the state Department of Environment and Natural Resources under EPA restrictions, according to Brian Gustafson, DENR administrator of air quality.\Emitters of sulfur dioxide and other pollutants are required to have a DENR permit once they reach the threshold of 100 tons of pollutant a year, Gustafson said. Permits cost $100 to apply for, take 90 days to obtain and carry an annual fee based on the amount of pollutants a permit-holder releases in a given year.\If carbon dioxide were added to the list of pollutants, businesses or schools that use small boilers could be required to get a permit to continue operating.\""They don't meet (the threshold) for the others, but they would meet it for carbon dioxide,"" Gustafson said.\The annual fee can be hefty, as well. If a business with a permit releases 150 tons of sulfur dioxide in a year, for example, the fee would be $1,915. The fees for carbon dioxide aren't set yet, but Gustafson said the fees would have to generate enough money to pay for the new regulatory costs.\Jackley fears the federal government will not offer any assistance to the state for enforcement and force his office to use state money to prosecute at least some of the businesses that fail to follow the federal rules.\Jackley decided to join the lawsuit to overturn the endangerment findings based on comments from several interest groups in South Dakota, he said. Virginia, Texas and Alabama initially filed the lawsuit. Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah have added their support.\Because the finding was supported by data from the now-controversial International Panel on Climate Change, Jackley said, the broad authority it grants the federal government is unjustified.\""This issue is not whether the greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to climate change - this is the process that EPA underwent,"" Jackley said. ""That process was literally farming this out to entities outside of the United States to get their research, then leap-frogging into this endangerment finding and then rule-making authority.""\The South Dakota Farmer's Union doesn't want the EPA to deal with carbon emissions, either, said Doug Sombke, president of the group. Farmers would rather see the cap-and-trade bill passed, he said, because farmers would be able to make money through carbon sequestration.\Cap-and-trade systems cap the amount of carbon businesses can release each year. Those that go over the limit would be able to purchase credits from businesses that emit less than their limit or from those who sequester carbon.\Farmers who practice no-till agriculture or regulate their fertilizer use would be able to sell credits, he said.\""Cap-and-trade is nothing more than free enterprise working at its best,"" Sombke said.\The Farmer's Union does not dispute the effects of carbon on climate change, he said, but tackling the global problem shouldn't involve burdensome regulations handed down from afar, Somke said.\Haggling over how to regulate carbon has become so political that people forget about the real dangers of climate change, said Aberdeen's Peter Carrels, a regional representative for the Sierra Club.\Carrels said the research of South Dakota State University wetland ecology professor Carter Johnson clearly shows how climate change affects the northern Great Plains. A February report from Johnson and his fellow researchers called ""Prairie Wetland Landscape in a Changing Climate"" said that rising temperatures would destroy habitat for 60 percent of the nation's waterfowl.\Carbon emissions must be regulated to mitigate the drastic effects of man-made climate change, Carrels said.\""The Sierra Club agrees with the EPA that large emissions of carbon dioxide are troublesome and that actions need to be taken to address the pollution,"" Carrels said. ""Water and air quality problems don't know political boundaries.""\Reach reporter John Hult at 331-2301."
11,"Bill Janklow was a four-term governor. Stephanie Herseth was the scion of a prominent political family. Kristi Noem was a leader in the state Legislature.\So who's Matt Varilek?\He's hoping the answer, as it was for Janklow, Herseth and Noem, is South Dakota's next member of Congress.\But to reach that goal, Varilek will have to persuade voters to turn against Noem, the person they elected only two years ago -- and a candidate who this time around seems to have every advantage.\A long shot?\Even Varilek admits he's an underdog.\""I just don't think many people expected that we could make it a competitive race. Working every day, in the face of those expectations, was a challenge,"" Varilek said. ""I felt confident that if I got to talk to enough people about my priorities that the reaction would be good and, slowly, perceptions would change.""\Whether perceptions will change is the question. Varilek has continued to trail Noem in fundraising, but has collected enough money to run television ads for most of six weeks. Data are scarce; no national firms have released any polls of the race, but one local firm suggests Noem leads by fewer than 10 points.\Could Varilek actually win? Analysts are skeptical, but they don't rule it out.\""In a state like South Dakota, Democrats are starting off in a difficult political position,"" said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. ""Any Democrat in the state running this year is going to have to get a whole bunch of Romney voters.""\Jon Schaff, a political science professor at Northern State University, said Varilek has done better than might have been expected.\""An unknown, unfunded candidate -- it didn't look very good for Varilek,"" Schaff said. ""Varilek is giving Noem a little bit more run for the money than maybe we would have anticipated a few months ago, or maybe a few weeks ago.""\If Varilek does pull off the upset, what kind of person will South Dakota voters be sending to Congress in place of the now well-known Noem?\Eight years on congressional staff\The most recent, and arguably most important, part of Varilek's background is the eight years he spent as a congressional staff member, first for Sen. Tom Daschle and, primarily, for Sen. Tim Johnson.\Varilek worked on economic development issues for the two senators, first in Washington, D.C., before moving to Sioux Falls in 2007. Businesses that wanted their senator's help would come to Varilek, who also would represent his boss in meetings across the state.\Later, Varilek became Johnson's ""body man,"" the personal aide who traveled with him in South Dakota. Varilek drove Johnson across the state and attended meetings.\""I was with him constantly, from early '08 on, until I left the office,"" Varilek said. ""I joke, we got more quality time together than he probably ever bargained for.""\On the campaign trail, Varilek regularly cites his time working for Johnson on economic development.\""Every day I woke up, trying to help the senator's efforts to help South Dakota become a more prosperous place, trying to help small businesses, trying to find resources for infrastructure,"" Varilek said at a recent debate.\But differences between life as a staffer and life as a candidate are vast. Working for Johnson and Daschle, Varilek could stay largely behind the scenes. He earned a good salary with excellent benefits, working for causes he loved, while never having to worry about political opponents digging through his personal life and background and buying television ads attacking him.\From back to front as campaigner\Now he's the guy in front of the cameras.\""Any mistakes that occur are mine. There's a lot on the line with every appearance,"" Varilek said, adding that he enjoys the new, more exposed role.\He got some advice on how to be a candidate from Johnson, his political mentor and backer.\""I talked to him about what it's like to run for Congress,"" said Johnson, who has won five House elections and three more Senate races over his congressional career. ""I told him, 'Do what's right, and you'll get along fine.'""\But Johnson has given Varilek more than just advice. Early on, Johnson gave him a crucial endorsement and money, and encouraged other prominent Democrats to support Varilek in his primary battle against Minnehaha County Commissioner Jeff Barth.\Varilek collected endorsements from former Sens. Tom Daschle and George McGovern and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars en route to a landslide primary win.\Republicans paint Johnson and Varilek's relationship as one of political schemers.\""Sen. Johnson and Matt Varilek, they were plotting his campaign long before he left the office,"" said Tony Post, executive director of the South Dakota Republican Party.\Post pointed to a Varilek trip last November to Washington, D.C. It was an official visit for Johnson's office, paid for by taxpayers. But on the trip, Varilek had discussions with Democratic Party campaign officials about his possible candidacy.\""Right before he left, he expensed the trip to taxpayers, which is troubling to say the least,"" Post said.\Varilek said he obeyed all rules about political work by congressional staffers.\""It was most definitely an official trip where I was meeting with other members of staff and working on official issues. That was all done according to the rules,"" Varilek said. ""It's inevitable that you have political discussions ... and we're allowed in our free time to have political conversations.""\Environmental analysis work\If Varilek loves to talk about his time with Johnson, Noem's favorite part of Varilek's biography is the time between Varilek's college graduation in 1997 and 2004,when he went to work for Daschle.\During that time, Varilek alternated between graduate education and working on issues related to the environment.\In 1997 and 1998, he was a teaching assistant at the Biosphere II facility in Arizona, which had become infamous several years earlier for the collapse of two ambitious experiments amid infighting and mistakes. By the time Varilek showed up, the Biosphere II was under new management and largely avoided the spotlight.\But it was the start of a period of interest in environmental issues that has become a political liability as Varilek seeks elected office. From 1999 to 2001, and again from 2002 to 2004, Varilek worked as an analyst and broker for Natsource LLC, a company working with emerging markets for pollution emissions.\A decade earlier, President George H.W. Bush's administration set up a system called cap-and-trade to deal with sulfur dioxide pollution, a contributor to acid rain. The system, in which total sulfur dioxide emissions are capped and companies can buy and sell permits to emit the gas, generally was seen as a success, and policymakers began looking at applying the same system to the larger question of carbon dioxide.\Natsource was at the forefront of carbon emissions markets, viewed by supporters as a way to tackle climate change with minimal economic consequences. At Natsource, Varilek wrote papers about cap-and-trade systems, exploring the laws and rules necessary to set up a working system and predicting the effects different laws would have on emissions markets.\Noem regularly cites these papers in campaign events and debates as proof Varilek is out-of-touch with South Dakota interests.\""Matt has spent years working on policies that would put into place and give a lot of traction to cap-and-trade legislation, which would be devastating to South Dakota and our ag industry and families living here,"" said Noem, who in 2010 defeated incumbent Herseth-Sandlin by a margin of 48.1 percent to 45.9 percent. Third-party candidate B. Thomas Marking got about 19,000 votes.\Varilek said he doesn't support cap-and-trade legislation and never did.\""I was an analyst, and my job was to understand the dynamics in those markets and provide that analysis to various clients,"" Varilek said.\Varilek doesn't bring up his time at Natsource much on his own. It earns a sentence in his official biography, which describes him boosting his ""private sector experience"" at an ""energy commodities brokerage.""\While he cares about the environment, Varilek says his true passion is economic development -- the subject of a full paragraph in his bio.\""I think the economic aspect of it is maybe the one I can pinpoint more easily,"" Varilek said. ""That relates to my upbringing as someone who needed a few helping hands to change my economic status.""\Tight times for family growing up\Varilek was born May 19, 1975, to Dave Varilek and Irene Varilek -- now Irene Wolf -- in Yankton, where he grew up.\The name Varilek is Czech, and Varilek jokes that even members of his extended family couldn't agree on how to pronounce it. (Varilek pronounces the ""ar"" in his name like ""air."")\He said he doesn't remember much about what things were like for his family when he was young. But by the second grade, when Varilek's parents divorced and he went to live with his mom, money was tight.\""I come from a family that never had much money,"" Varilek said at one of his debates with Noem. ""Consequently, I've been working my whole life.""\The family wasn't poor -- ""I don't recall any times when we were not provided for,"" he said -- but there wasn't ""a lot of wiggle room in the budget.""\He worked a string of jobs -- delivering newspapers, cooking burgers at Burger King, working as a waiter, a dishwasher and a security guard. Above all, Varilek highlights his time ""picking beans"" for local farmers.\Varilek later went on to study at prestigious colleges -- Carleton College in Minnesota, Glasgow University in Scotland and Cambridge University in England.\Both foreign universities were paid for by scholarships -- Cambridge by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Glasgow by Rotary International.\In Varilek's campaign narrative, this early history of work and scholarships is the foundation for his politics. He said he's running to represent people trying to reach the middle class, and middle class people trying to stay there.\""That experience shapes the way I see the world, and the fact that we are a state of middle class people dictates that we should have a representative who prioritizes standing up for middle class people,"" Varilek said.\Preserving Medicare, no to some tax cuts\If elected, Varilek said he'll fight to keep Medicare a defined-benefit system, opposing reform proposals from Republicans such as Noem to let younger people choose a premium-support method instead in which the government gives seniors money to buy health insurance.\He supports letting tax cuts expire for incomes over $250,000 a year, and says the money from these increased taxes should help pay down the debt. This, Varilek said, will help protect spending programs he sees as valuable from unnecessarily harsh cuts.\But while Varilek said these proposals grow out of his history growing up without much money, Noem said they reflect an affinity for big government.\""My opponent wants to give the government more control over your businesses,"" Noem said at an August debate with Varilek. ""He wants to tax you more. He wants to spend more. He wants more EPA and he wants more of a government-controlled society.""\That's not true, Varilek said.\His voting record, he said, ""would be attempting to represent the interests of regular South Dakotans, rather than spending my time taking pledges to defend the interests of those who are already doing so well.""\Signs 'of a tight race,' Democrat says\Can Varilek actually win?\Not surprisingly, Varilek argues it's a tight race.\""Slowly, we've gone from a situation where I think folks assumed she would have a cakewalk to now a case where she's attacking me by name in TV ads,"" he said. ""I think that's a sign of a tight race.""\Rothenberg isn't so sure, from his discussions with political insiders in Washington, D.C.\""Democrats continue to talk about it as kind of a dark horse upset special,"" Rothenberg said. But the lack of announcements and investments in Varilek's race by national Democrats, when they have put money into plenty of long-shot campaigns, suggests they're not optimistic, Rothenberg said.\""Maybe something could happen there, but it really isn't on our radar screen,"" Rothenberg said. ""There's not enough national buzz about it.""\If Varilek is going to prove that national buzz wrong, he'll have to win over people such as Don Nugent, who lives south of Madison.\Nugent said Varilek's ads on TV have made him think twice about supporting Noem.\""I've always thought Kristi Noem was doing a pretty good job, but according to Matt Varilek, it's the other side,"" Nugent said.\Now Nugent is undecided, looking into both candidates in the final weeks before the election.\One thing seems obvious, Schaff said: What could have been a landslide for Noem is surprisingly competitive, even if Noem remains the favorite.\""While he's an underdog, I think people might be surprised how close Varilek makes this,"" Schaff said.\ONLINE\VIDEO: See past debates between Varilek and Rep.

Daschle and Johnson, 2004-2011.\FAMILY: Wife, Maggie; daughters, Willa, 3, and Mae, 1.\Varilek on the issues\QUESTION: What steps should Congress take to address the upcoming ""fiscal cliff"" of spending cuts and tax increases?\ANSWER: The fiscal cliff is looming because of this Congress' dysfunction. Too many of our representatives signed a pledge of allegiance to the Washington insider Grover Norquist, promising never to compromise. They pledge never to accept a budget reduction package if it would mean asking a single extra penny from millionaires and billionaires like Donald Trump. I pledge not to take such silly pledges to non-South Dakotans. I pledge to work with others on a compromise that avoids the cliff. The incumbent, Rep. (Kristi) Noem, has had two years to work on this. It's time to try a more constructive approach.\QUESTION: How, if at all, should the Medicare program be changed to ensure its financial health?\ANSWER: My detailed plan contains ideas for preserving traditional Medicare. I believe Medicare should do a better job of incentivizing quality care and positive health outcomes. I support allowing Medicare to save money by negotiating directly with drug wholesalers, just like the VA does. I support speeding up the availability of more affordable generic drugs. My opponent's radical plan would dismantle traditional Medicare, turning it into a voucher program, shifting thousands of dollars of costs onto seniors. Most outrageous of all: Rep. Noem would force such sacrifice on seniors in order to finance new budget-busting tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans.\QUESTION: What should America's agriculture program look like, considering both best policy and the necessity of getting a bill through Congress?\ANSWER: I believe sound ag policy must include a strong safety net to protect farmers and ranchers against unsustainable losses, provisions to ensure fair and transparent pricing for buyers and sellers, and incentives that conserve resources for future generations. It is ridiculous that Rep. Noem and her colleagues had the gall to let the farm bill expire, despite the drought we experienced this year. At this very moment, incumbents responsible for this situation are campaigning for re-election. We should say no to the status quo and elect new leaders who will work together on getting a farm bill passed.\QUESTION: What concrete steps can Congress do to create jobs and jump-start the economy?\ANSWER: We could unleash great economic optimism if we stopped ""kicking the can down the road"" regarding the budget deficit, wind energy, and the farm bill. If Rep. Noem and her colleagues had passed the wind energy tax credit, 92 people in Aberdeen might still have jobs. If Congress had passed a farm bill, our producers would not be wondering what kind of safety net will be in place. Tea partiers oppose the wind industry and oppose the farm bill as ""welfare for farmers."" They don't understand these important industries, and they don't understand that South Dakotans want progress, not confrontation.\QUESTION: Many Americans have expressed frustration with both the cost and coverage of health care, but President Obama's health care reform law has proven controversial. What should Congress do to reform health care in America?\ANSWER: The Affordable Care Act contains good and bad. We should build on the good and fix the bad. On the positive side, it offers help for millions of previously uninsured people up to age 26, people with pre-existing conditions, and seniors struggling with high prescription drug costs. We could improve the law by allowing for regional insurance exchanges, to take advantage of greater insurance company competition across state lines. My opponent will boast of symbolically voting to repeal the law, not once but 33 times. Yet she hasn't found the time to vote even once on an alternative plan.\QUESTION: The federal Defense of Marriage Act, which limits recognition of same-sex marriages by the federal government and states, is under political and legal attack. What steps do you support for federal policy toward same-sex marriages?\ANSWER: I support civil unions in order to start treating everyone equally under the law when it comes to tax policy and health care. I don't think the federal government should be in the marriage business. So I support leaving the term marriage in the hands of individual states and churches to define for themselves."
12,"Jamie Horter is in love with the world - it's an infatuation on a molecular level, the adoration for the overall masterpiece.\In less than a month, the Augustana College senior - she's a dual major in chemistry and art - will travel to Copenhagen, Denmark, to be part of the United Nations Climate Change Conference. As a member of the Will Steger Foundation's Expedition Copenhagen delegation, she will attend meetings and then disseminate information about what climate change will mean to South Dakotans.\The conference is Dec. 7-18.\""Being chosen has become a way for me to share the voice of South Dakota with the world,"" the 22-year-old said. ""It's not often that South Dakota gets put on a global basis, or mentioned, I should say. Since really, we're the lungs of the nation. We're fourth in wind energy potential, and it's something I plan on taking with me to discuss. And I hope to bring back the ideas of others that I interact with and share.""\Contentious debate\Like the weather itself, climate change is an issue that remains up for interpretation by scientists, politicians and the public. For every person who thinks man has changed the planet for the worse, there are those who think it's nothing but a bunch of hot air.\The issue has grown ever contentious in the U.S., as Congress debates legislation that would change how Americans deal with greenhouse gas emissions. Last Thursday, Senate Democrats moved their version of the bill out of committee - while the meeting was boycotted by Republicans. The move came a day after a trio of senators with differing viewpoints began working to formulate a bill that could pass the Senate.\The committee action, experts said, could make it difficult for the measure to find the 60 votes needed to pass.\""If environmental policy is not good business policy, you will not get 60 votes,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\The House, without the support of Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, D-S.D., passed its version of the bill in late June.\United in opposition\In South Dakota, the four Republican candidates for governor issued a rare, joint news release announcing their opposition to climate legislation, based on cap-and-trade issues. A major piece of the bill, cap-and-trade would raise the cost of carbon-based energy such as coal, thus forcing people to conserve.\Lt. Gov. Dennis Daugaard, Senate Majority Leader Dave Knudson, former Brookings Mayor Scott Munsterman and rancher Ken Knuppe all said the bill would be bad for the state.\""This legislation would burden U.S. farmers and ranchers; consumers will be forced to pay more for the same goods and services they are getting now,"" Knuppe said.\Rising costs are at the heart of the cap-and-trade debate. The estimates for price increases swing wildly - from the cost of a postage stamp a day to $1,300 a year for a typical household.\South Dakotans could see their monthly electric bill rise from $80 to $118.40, or 48 percent, by 2015, according to a South Dakota Public Utilities Commission study. The state relies heavily on coal for power.\Midwest's big role\""I'm still hopeful (the legislation) will pass, since it will make things much easier when we get to Copenhagen,"" Horter said. ""It shows we're serious about being leaders, especially being out in front of other countries. But if it doesn't go through, it will just show how important the legislation is to pass when we get back.""\With the U.S. struggling to come to consensus, European officials have begun work on a nonbinding agreement framework, which would allow richer nations to make climate commitments that are not legally binding.\Despite the churn, climate issues are important, proponents said. Especially to South Dakotans.\""A lot of what happens with climate change is stirred up on both coasts - that's where the action is,"" said Abby Fenton, education program manager for the Will Steger Foundation. ""But we hold a lot of the solutions - Middle America will lead the climate charge - and our young people are really active.""\Up to the challenge\Enter Horter, summer intern at the Sioux Falls Green Project, president of Augustana's Green Group and a member of the Augustana Coalition for Social Justice, the Sioux Falls Transportation Committee and Trash Initiative Focus Group.\""I can't really pinpoint when, all of a sudden, I became an environmentalist,"" she said. ""Just the experiences in college and meeting people who were environmentally savvy and into the sciences, I think that made the biggest difference. It just opened up a whole new dialogue about the environment and what's going on, on a global basis and a regional basis.""\Those who know her say Horter is up to the task to represent South Dakotans in Denmark.\""Two things pop out about Jamie - she's so passionate about this, and she's wicked smart,"" said Joe Bartmann, executive director of the Sioux Falls Green Project. ""She listens to people and she understands the issues, so that's who I want to represent us in Copenhagen. And, she's fearless to the core.""\Her fearlessness - and art background - helped get the Bristol native on Steger's 12-member Copenhagen expedition. The students hail from Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, North Dakota, Iowa and South Dakota.\She put her application in a ski pole, with a note saying, ""If you want the other one, meet me in Copenhagen."" Steger, famous for his dogsled expeditions of both poles, is a Minnesota native.\""We were just shrieking with laughter,"" Fenton said. ""It really could have backfired, too. But it gave us some insight into Jamie, and it showed us how creative and brave she really is.""\""I was hanging out in the art department, as usual, and decided to play around with packaging,"" Horter said. ""We found this groovy old ski pole from the '50s and worked on getting it open. We even got the janitor involved. We got a lot of people involved.\""But my reasons (to apply) had to do with the environment concerning the Midwest and the future generations in South Dakota, which I'm very concerned about.""\Understanding issue\While in Copenhagen, Horter's area of interest will be environmental justice. To help her navigate the complexities of the issues, she's been paired with a mentor, Frank James, director of Dakota Rural Action in Brookings. While in Denmark, Horter will converse with James via e-mail.\James said it is important for her, and all South Dakotans, to understand that climate legislation is important to the state, the nation and the world.\""The bill that's out there, there's parts we have to support, parts that need to be changed and parts that we'll have to move off to the wayside,"" James said. ""But with South Dakota being so energy dependent as we are with the travel-distance disadvantage, this is a conversation that needs to happen.""\Past Copenhagen, even past her studies at Augustana, Horter said she'd like to remain in South Dakota.\""I think it's important for future generations to stay in the state, and I think if we can open up our clean energy jobs, there's hope for all of us,"" she said.\Reach Thom Gabrukiewicz at 331-2320.

13,"Ellis\What's a biosphere? I mean, besides the one we call Earth?\If you're just getting tuned into this year's U.S. House race, I suppose you'll find out in short order.\Matt Varilek, the Democratic challenger to Rep. Kristi Noem, was a teaching assistant in 1997 at the Biosphere 2 facility. The laboratory, in Arizona, started off with grand ambitions. Humanoid subjects were supposed to live in harmony among themselves and their environment in an enclosed ecology, cut off from the rest of the world, forced to go it on their own.\By the time Varilek arrived, the whole experiment of encasing humans in an artificial world, tasked with making it on their own, had collapsed as a failure. Still, the facility had value as a laboratory about human interaction and effects on the environment.\According to the Noem campaign, Varilek's tie to this Biosphere 2 thing is more evidence that Varilek is a dingbat environmentalist.\Still, there is something appealing about living in a self-sufficient world with people of like mind. A liberal biosphere would surely include a solar-powered limousine to carry its inhabitants from one coffee shop to the next. A biosphere for Wall Street bankers would include a derivatives bath house and just enough servants to pick the arugula. Sadly, for the NRA biosphere, its residents would be armed with rubber band guns, a necessity to prevent errant shots from dooming the artificial world to collapse and almost certain gun control.\My own biosphere would include my wife, of course, because she's the only one who knows how to work the remotes and without her I wouldn't see a Denver Broncos game. I would bring Pastor Shawn Norton aboard for his inspiring, thought-provoking sermons. If he weren't dead, I would bring my old professor, Aleksander Shtromas, to gently remind me how little I know. And I would bring Elisha Page, an Argus Leader photographer. Besides making good pictures, Page is a standout at the art of beer making.\But this is election time, not some exercise in writing a modern adventure of Robinson Crusoe. This whole Biosphere 2 thing has a tinge of ""what the hell is that"" elitism to it. So too does the fact that Varilek attended graduate school at exotic locales such as Scotland and England, where they don't speak American. Before working for Sen. Tim Johnson, Varilek worked for a company that specialized in energy contracts, and he analyzed cap-and-trade schemes. Varilek says he doesn't support cap-and-trade, which would require energy-using industries to buy credits when they exceeded the cap on the amount of carbon they were allowed to emit.\All of this became an issue last month at the Dakotafest debate between Noem and Varilek, the first between them. Noem, as they say, went big, accusing Varilek of being an environmental extremist. She went on the offensive against an opponent who, on paper, is lacking in every regard: Name recognition, fundraising, political party strength.\The campaign followed with radio ads that accused Varilek of being an environmental radical.\This was heavy artillery for an incumbent. Why? There are a couple schools of thought.\Here's one. Perhaps Noem isn't doing all that great. In 2010, Noem's race against Stephanie Herseth Sandlin was of great interest nationwide. There were several polls that charted the contest. They showed that Herseth Sandlin was vulnerable. The same public polls haven't been made in this year's contest. Still, polling is being done by the campaigns.\It could be that those polls show a tight race. Thus, the need for Noem to go on the offensive.\Or perhaps it's this: Maybe Noem feels more comfortable being a political predator. In 1990, she won the South Dakota Snow Queen title. Perhaps ice water flows in her veins.\During the 2010 race, Noem demonstrated her skill as a political knifer. Throughout the campaign she was consistently on message, and that message was to attack the shortcomings of the incumbent. It was a skill she also demonstrated in the state Legislature. In one memorable committee meeting, she picked a fight with Scott Heidepriem. At the time, Heidepriem was the Legislature's reigning orator, and not somebody you'd want to tangle with. Noem didn't care.\But things changed when she won. She became the target. It hasn't helped that she chose to become part of the House leadership team. In the polarized world of Congress, with Republicans controlling the House and Democrats the Senate, little has been accomplished. Democrats here are attempting to tie Noem to Congress' failures. And worse, for an electorate that treasures hard work, Democrats successfully have questioned her work ethic.\Maybe Noem got tired of being kicked around. So she decided to bludgeon her opponent with questions about his background.\Whatever the reason, the race got a little more spicy than it was. And it's likely to stay that way.\Jonathan Ellis covers government and politics.

14,"WASHINGTON - Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin voted against a landmark climate-change bill that narrowly passed the House on Friday night and now faces an uncertain fate in the Senate.\The House passed the bill 219-212 on a mostly party-line vote. Republicans were overwhelmingly against the measure, arguing it would destroy jobs in the midst of a recession while burdening consumers with a new tax in the form of higher energy costs.\The South Dakota congresswoman was one of 44 Democrats - mostly moderates from rural states - to oppose the measure. She said the measure could lead to dramatic rate hikes for South Dakota customers and doesn't go far enough to expand the definition of renewable energy.\Herseth Sandlin also said that she strongly supports the bill's goal of reducing the pollution blamed for global warming and that allowing climate change to continue could have a ""profound effect on South Dakota's economy and our way of life.""\But she did not like the last-minute nature of the process and said concessions made recently to soften the blow to rural areas fell short.\""Given the complexity both of the climate change problem and the steps needed to address it, we need to take time to get it right,"" she said in a statement after her vote. ""The stakes are simply too high for a rushed solution that can potentially create more problems than it solves. ""\The sweeping measure, which now faces a tough audience in the Senate, would create a controversial market-based system for trading pollution allowances, called cap-and-trade.\Supporters say it would create a new class of ""green"" jobs while saving the environment and helping the nation reduce its reliance on foreign oil. South Dakota, in particular, could benefit greatly by tapping into its wind energy potential.\The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill could cost the average household about $175 annually by 2020. Opponents question that analysis and say it's much too low.\Herseth Sandlin said compromises made during the past few days to appease rural concerns improved the proposal.\For example, the Department of Agriculture - not the Environmental Protection Agency - would be in charge of regulating the use of farm and forestry projects intended to offset carbon dioxide emissions from industrial sources. It also would exempt agriculture and forestry sectors from greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements, she said.\Herseth Sandlin said she heard from several utilities ""that the allowances for emissions in the bill still aren't fairly distributed and this disparity could mean dramatic rate hikes for its customers in South Dakota.""\Contributing: John Yaukey and Nicole Gaudiano of Gannett; and the Associated Press. Contact Ledyard King at lking@gannett.com.\Goals of climate bill\Reducing carbon emissions 17 percent by 2020 from 2005 levels, and 80 percent by 2050. This would be done largely through the cap-and-trade program, under which pollution permits could be bought and sold on an exchange.\Requiring utilities to produce as much as 20 percent of their electricity through renewable energy sources or through increasing efficiency.\Investing in new clean-energy technologies, including systems that would capture and store carbon, a leading greenhouse gas.\Writing new energy-saving standards for buildings and appliances.\Imposing tighter performance standards on new coal-fired power plants\Allowing companies to meet emission targets by investing in projects elsewhere such as tree planting, forest conservation."
15,"South Dakota's political leaders are lobbying hard against a new federal rule that will, for the first time, limit the toxic air pollution that can be emitted from coal-fired power plants.\Gov. Dennis Daugaard signed a letter this month urging President Obama to shelve the utility air toxics rule, also known as the Utility MACT (Maximum Achievable Control Technology). It was proposed in March by the Environmental Protection Agency.\Attorney General Marty Jackley has joined 24 other attorneys general in filing an amicus brief on behalf of the Utility Air Regulatory Group, a trade group that has asked a federal court to delay the rule for a year.\And the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission wants federal energy regulators to study how the rule - and others like it - would affect the nation's power supply and the price of electricity. By court order, the MACT rule will be made final by Nov. 16.\The rule establishes limits on the amount of mercury, arsenic, acid gases and other toxins that can be emitted by large coal-fired plants. Of principal concern to environmental and public health advocates is mercury, a neurotoxin that can cause delays in child development. According to the EPA, coal-fired units account for half of all mercury emissions in the U.S.\Utilities will have up to four years to comply with the new standards. But critics say the cost of compliance, estimated by the EPA at $11 billion annually, will force coal plants to shut down and put an end to the era of cheap, reliable power.\""It is bad enough when the lights go out because of a natural disaster. ... But there is no excuse if the lights go out because of poor government decision-making,"" PUC commissioners said in comments filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The vast majority of the state's electricity comes from coal or hydropower.\The EPA's cost-benefit analysis of the MACT rule concluded that it would have minimal effect on reliability, and that the benefits of averting thousands of illnesses and premature deaths would be five to 13 times greater than the cost to industry and ratepayers.\""In its 40-year history, there have been no instances in which the Clean Air Act has contributed to electric grid reliability problems,"" the agency said in a prepared statement.\The new standards will require utilities to reduce mercury emissions by 91 percent. Most mercury exposure comes from eating fish - the mercury enters water from the air and works its way up the food chain (mercury also occurs naturally in soils). In South Dakota, there are a dozen fish consumption advisories.\South Dakota has two coal-fired plants. Only Big Stone, near Milbank, is large enough to require compliance with the MACT rule, said Kyrik Rombough, air quality engineer with the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources.\Cindy Kuismi, a spokeswoman for Otter Tail Power, Big Stone's majority owner, said the 36-year-old plant has proposed installing an air quality control system to meet a separate EPA smog directive. The upgraded equipment would allow Big Stone to meet MACT standards, she said. Otter Tail is a member of the Utility Air Regulatory Group.\The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in August released a report examining eight pending EPA rules that would affect coal-fired plants - to critics, a ""regulatory train wreck."" But the report noted that many of the rules have been years in the making; the MACT rule, for example, was required as part of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. The report concluded that the power plants most likely to be affected are in trouble already. Old, inefficient and lacking modern pollution controls, these plants are candidates for replacement by more efficient natural gas plants.\House Republicans last month passed a bill that would block new pollution rules, including MACT. The White House said it would veto the bill if it survived the Democratic-led Senate. In separate statements, Sen. John Thune and Rep. Kristi Noem criticized the EPA's rules.\""We need a timeout on new job-killing regulations,"" Thune said. ""I support promoting a clean, healthy environment, but we need to make sure the benefits of these efforts outweigh the economic costs.""\Noem said, ""This EPA is out of control and seems to show no regard for the impact their rules have on the real world. I strongly support delaying this rule so we can get a better handle on its impact and then craft something that protects our environment without destroying jobs.""\Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., could not be reached for comment.\Reach reporter Cody Winchester at 331-2320. Read his blog here, and follow him on Twitter @cody_winchester\Online\Read the proposed rule at goo.gl/SJRyn.\Long road\The Utility MACT was required by the Clean Air Act amendments passed in 1990. But utilities were given special consideration, and the EPA had to conduct studies and submit a report to Congress before the toxics standards could apply to power plants. EPA submitted its report to Congress in 1998. Then, in 2000, the EPA moved to include power plants in its air toxics standards. The agency reversed course in 2005, instead introducing a cap-and-trade system for mercury emissions, but that approach was vacated by a federal appeals court in 2008. A coalition of environmental and public health groups sued the government in late 2008 to force the EPA's hand. The settlement of this case, in 2010, required the EPA to finalize an air toxics rule for power plants by Nov. 16, 2011. A utilities trade group, with the backing of South Dakota and 24 other states, has asked the court to delay this rule for a year.\Source: EPA, Congressional Research Service\ONLINE\Read the proposed rule at goo.gl/SJRyn and the source documents at argusleader.com.\ID_Code: DF-110170306"
16,"All that banging you heard last month? Yeah, it was the Republicans.\They were busy hammering nails and garlic into the lid of what they hope is Stephanie Herseth Sandlin's political coffin.\They don't want her to be undead, rise again and command South Dakota's political scene. So when word reached the masses that Herseth Sandlin was taking a position with a Washington, D.C.-lobbying firm, the state GOP slammed her, accusing her of ""cashing out.""\As an aside, I think most of us would love to ""cash out."" I would. I'm still patiently waiting for the renaissance of epic poetry. And waiting. And waiting.\Anyhow, while I wait, there's this Herseth Sandlin business.\Republicans have done well in the past few years. Consider, when Herseth Sandlin won in 2004, Democrats controlled the state's three federal seats.\Now they're in Alamo mode, worrying about their prospects of holding Sen. Tim Johnson's seat in 2014.\Republicans already have done recon on their potential opponents, and the threats are being attacked. Thus the assault on Herseth Sandlin, which sought to reinforce the narrative that she's a creature of Washington.\At least for now, it's not exactly a target-rich environment for Republicans. There's Herseth Sandlin, who on a bad day could garner enough votes to be competitive. The Democrats are - to the horror of any pro-football fan - in rebuilding mode. So Republicans, while they prepare for 2014, are solidifying their position.\That explains the news release sent out last week by the state GOP. This time the target was Brendan Johnson, the son of the aforementioned Sen. Johnson. Brendan, now 35, has been on the GOP watch list since about the time he hit puberty. All signs point to the possibility that Brendan Johnson will, at some point, enter politics.\Many Republicans are betting that Tim Johnson isn't going to seek a fourth term in the Senate come 2014. His voting record has become increasingly liberal, a departure from his middle-of-the-road past. If they're right, it doesn't mean there won't be a Johnson on the ballot, they say. All signs point to an entry by Brendan Johnson, if not for Senate then at least the House.\Brendan presumably gave up a lucrative job at a private law firm to become the U.S. attorney for South Dakota, a position appointed by the president. Republicans suspect that Sen. Johnson cleared the decks of other nominees so that Brendan would get the job.\It's a good job for somebody looking ahead to politics. Brendan Johnson does a lot of travelling around the state. He's in contact with county sheriffs and other law enforcement officials, an excellent network from which to draw future support. His office is frequently in the news. After all, he's putting the bad guys in jail.\His office also hired the daughter of Steve Kirby. Kirby is an important player in the GOP when it comes to raising money. In 2008, remember, Kirby, a former lieutenant governor, was considering a run against Sen. Johnson. Democrats clubbed him and he stayed out. Now his daughter is working for the senator's son, which Republicans consider a shrewd move on Brendan's part.\Brendan responds that politics has no role in hiring decisions.\""We look at merit,"" he said.\He's a concern for Republicans. Maybe he tries to challenge Rep. Kristi Noem in 2012. So the state GOP put out a news release calling on Brendan to ""distance himself"" from his father's support of allowing the EPA to implement cap-and-trade regulations on carbon emissions. The Senate could vote next week on a proposal to prohibit the EPA from doing that. Republicans are banking that the regulations would be unpopular in South Dakota.\State GOP Chairman Tim Rave says the EPA vote is a big issue for South Dakota, and he thinks Brendan should announce where he stands on the issue. ""I don't think it's a secret that he's planning on doing something in the future - probably in the near future.""\Brendan isn't playing ball. When the news release came out, he said he was in Washington meeting with law enforcement officials about international and domestic threats to national security. Brendan seemed amused by the news release. As an employee of the Justice Department, he said it's ""not appropriate"" to be involved in political issues.\So Brendan Johnson joins Herseth Sandlin on the GOP watch list. A couple of other names are likely to join them.\Public Utilities Commissioner Steve Kolbeck won a surprising statewide victory in 2006. There's also Sioux Falls Mayor Mike Huether. It hasn't gone unnoticed that Huether bought about 16 acres of land last year north of Sioux Falls and built a house on a lake.\Might this be the launching pad for a statewide campaign?\Huether scoffs at that thought. He and his wife plan to die in their Sioux Falls home, he said. The lake house is a place where the two can relax.\""I have always had on my magic list to have a place where I can get away from it all,"" he said. ""I love fishing. I've hardly had any time in the last 25 years to do any fishing. I want to fish again.""\Huether says he's not thinking about politics. ""I've got enough opportunity to focus on right here in Sioux Falls, and that's what I'm doing.""\Even if he's not thinking about politics, plenty of others are, both Republicans and Democrats. It's the age of the perpetual campaign, and as the next election gets closer, both parties will ratchet it up.\Jonathan Ellis covers government and politics for the Argus Leader.

17,"The Big Stone II coal-fired power plant project is no more, as the remaining partners in the venture said Monday that building the $1.6 billion plant near Milbank no longer is economically possible.\Those partners include the Central Minnesota Municipal Power Agency, Heartland Consumers Power District, Missouri River Energy Services and Montana-Dakota Utilities Co.\The plant was to generate about 580 megawatts of electricity by burning low-sulfur, pulverized coal from Wyoming. In a joint statement, the partners said it was the least costly, most environmentally sound baseload power plant for the participants. But when no new partners came forward to share in the costs, it was apparent that the plant could not be built.\""We spent a lot of time and energy on this, but it's time to move forward,"" said Bob Schulte, chief executive officer of Central Minnesota Municipal Power Agency. ""Obviously it's frustrating since this was a fully permitted project, which is extremely infrequent these days, but we've said all along that we needed partners to move forward. We now have to find that next alternative, and we are disappointed that we're not able to deliver, as far as this project is concerned.""\Big Stone II had been in jeopardy since September, when Otter Tail Power Co. withdrew its support. Otter Tail was the lead utility looking to build the plant, next to its existing Big Stone coal plant that came online in 1975. The project first was proposed in 2003.\""Each Big Stone II participant is in a different position in terms of means and impact of raising capital and mechanisms for recovering those costs from customers,"" Otter Tail President and CEO Chuck MacFarlane said in September. ""Given the legislative and regulatory uncertainties and current economic conditions, Otter Tail Power Co. is unwilling to create a binding financial obligation of approximately $400 million for its share of the project at this time.""\Critics cheer\Environmental groups hailed the move Monday, saying the Midwest needs to divest itself from coal and invest heavily in green power, such as wind and solar. About 76 percent of the electricity generated in the West North Central region - Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota - is coal-fired.\""I think this is an opportunity for the remaining institutions, the remaining utilities, to invest their expertise and capital into a speedy transition to a cleaner energy future,"" said Pete Carrels, regional representative of the Sierra Club. ""I just think that these utilities and energy organizations have the expertise that can be utilized in a positive way, and those advantages can move us forward to a cleaner energy future faster.""\Each utility was prepared to move forward on its own to provide future power to its customers.\""I think we echo the statements of the other partners in saying that we're disappointed in seeing it end, since regulators found it to be the least-cost, most efficient project,"" said state Sen. Russ Olson, R-Madison, who also is the manager of community and economic development for Heartland. ""But we've got a pretty diverse energy plan moving forward. We have enough resources to meet our customers' needs.""\For Heartland, Olson said, that portfolio includes a 51-megawatt wind farm near Wessington Springs, a purchase power agreement with the Nebraska Public Power District to buy power from its Cooper Nuclear Station near Hastings, as well as buying hydroelectric power from the Western Area Power Administration\Natural gas next?\Big Stone II's future first became clouded in January, when the Environmental Protection Agency filed objections with the air permit issued by the state Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The EPA's action came a week after the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approved - with conditions - a $256 million power transmission line that would cross the southwestern part of the state. The Minnesota PUC decision was the last of seven permits Big Stone II partners needed to move the project forward.\""I don't think it was totally unexpected, given the uncertainties for all big coal projects,"" South Dakota Public Utilities Commission Chairman Dusty Johnson said of the project's demise. ""You're still seeing coal plants being built, but most companies are going forward with much smaller projects. I do think you'll see natural gas become the workhorse for consumers in the next few years.""\Indeed, Central Minnesota Municipal Power Agency's Schulte said natural gas, while carrying with it heavy price volatility, could become the preferred baseload replacement for Big Stone II. Baseload capacity refers to the power output of a plant that can be continuously produced.\""We've got enough resources to last the next few years,"" Schulte said. ""Now, we have to look to the future for a long-term replacement, and that's probably natural gas.""\Coal controversy\Utilities that produce their baseload power needs by coal are facing increased scrutiny across the country.\On Oct. 27, the EPA published in the Federal Register its proposed rule change that would raise the greenhouse gas emissions threshold permitted by the Clean Air Act. The new proposal would apply to power plants and other plants that emit at least 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases a year. As written, the Clean Air Act applies to emitters of more than 250 tons a year.\Big Stone II was expected to release 4.5 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.\""One plus out of this, maybe the silver lining, is that it lets us take a much closer look at energy efficiency, to see where we could save with that low-hanging fruit,"" Johnson said.\Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said the additional 140 miles of new transmission lines that went along with Big Stone II could have been used to push wind energy out of South Dakota toward Minneapolis and St. Paul. Half of the estimated 1 million customers that would have been served by Big Stone II reside in Minnesota.\""The Big Stone II project would have created thousands of jobs and greater wind power transmission capacity in South Dakota,"" Thune said in a statement. ""It is a shame that the project was killed by the threat of cap-and-trade legislation in Congress and the Obama EPA's proposed global warming regulations.""\Reach Thom Gabrukiewicz at 331-2320."

The June primary winner would confront Herseth Sandlin in November.\Asked earlier this month whether he had been thinking about running, Rounds, through an e-mail from his press secretary, said: ""My plan is to go back to my business. Do I plan to make a change to my existing plans? Not at this time.""\In other words - the door remains open, ever so slightly. But it's also closing rapidly for him and others pondering the race. Candidates in the Republican primary must submit at least 2,070 petitions by March 30 to qualify for the primary.\Schoenbeck: 'We don't need a third'\Republicans say they are happy with the candidates they have. Independent analysts and Republicans speak highly of Nelson and Curd and say they have a shot at defeating Herseth Sandlin.\""We've got two really good candidates right now, and we don't need a third,"" said Lee Schoenbeck, the former state Senate president who retired in 2006.\But Rounds, others say, would be a clear favorite if he entered the race.\""Among the Republicans, if he wanted the seat, the Republican nomination would be his,"" said Michael Card, a political science professor at the University of South Dakota.\Republican successes the past few months in Virginia, New Jersey and Massachusetts portend a bad year for Democrats. In a profession where timing is everything, Republicans here say 2010 might be their best chance to derail Herseth Sandlin.\""I think the real story right now is you've got a candidate who is beatable, not necessarily because of who she is or what she did, but because of her party,"" Card said.\Many observers expected Rounds to challenge Sen. Tim Johnson in 2008. President Bush asked Rounds to run, but the governor turned him down. Now, two years later, Rounds can slip away from politics and the limelight, free to pal around with his friends and family in Pierre without the scrutiny that comes with being an elected official. At 56, he has time for a comeback - perhaps for Johnson's Senate seat in 2014.\Breaks from politics do little harm in S.D.\Gary Aguiar, a professor of political science at South Dakota State University, said this state is different from others when it comes to political careers.\Politicians routinely rotate in and out of political and private life, thanks to term limits and the nature of the citizen Legislature. A respite from politics, Aguiar said, would not hurt Rounds if he decided to return in a few years.\But, Aguiar added, he runs the risk of being overshadowed by other up-and-comers in the party. He also would be a little older, and the political environment an unknown.\""Each election cycle is so unique,"" Aguiar said. ""Nobody knows what it's going to be like in two years.""\We do have a good idea of what this election cycle's going to be like. With the exception of some budget votes and the stimulus vote, Herseth Sandlin has pretty much voted like a Republican, says former GOP Chairman Joel Rosenthal. But her votes against health care and against cap-and-trade also have hurt her with her activist base.\""She may not have the support she's had before,"" Rosenthal said. ""This could be a tough year for her.""\Shades of '02 race: Janklow vs. Herseth\If Rounds were to seize the opportunity, a general election matchup with Herseth Sandlin would feature two politicians who generally are well liked. Both can raise money, and both are articulate about national issues. Rounds, for his part, has been an outspoken critic of congressional efforts to overhaul health care, and he recently criticized President Obama after Obama scolded the Supreme Court during his State of the Union address.\""If he gets the money, which I think he can do, I think he can get elected,"" Aguiar said.\There would be some parallels to the 2002 election. Gov. Bill Janklow - then in his final year as governor - announced his run for the state's congressional seat in March of that year. Janklow went on to beat Herseth.\But this election also would be different. It was an open seat in 2002, after John Thune departed. Herseth Sandlin has occupied that seat since 2004 and won by big margins in her last two campaigns.\Schoenbeck, for one, said he doesn't think the GOP needs a governor to beat her. He said he hasn't been this optimistic in years for Republicans about the congressional race.\""I think that either Chris Nelson or Blake Curd is going to be the next congressperson from South Dakota,"" he said.\Back to 2002: After Janklow announced, two other competitors in the Republican primary dropped out. That wouldn't happen this time.\""I have every intention of winning this Republican primary, having a spirited competition in the fall, and going on to become South Dakota's next congressman,"" Nelson said.\Curd said people are ready to vote for somebody who hasn't been part of the political establishment, and his campaign would continue doing what it has been doing, with or without Rounds.\""It wouldn't do much for us,"" he said. ""But we'd probably have to accommodate another guy at the Lincoln Dinners.""\Reach reporter Jonathan Ellis at 575-3629.\Rounds bio\Name: Mike Rounds\Age: 56\Family: Married, four children\Career: Elected governor in 2002 after 10 years in the state Senate; re-elected in 2006.\Name: Mike Rounds\Age: 56\Family: Married, four children\Elected governor in 2002 after 10 years in the state Senate; re-elected in 2006"
19,"Jim Sanden, a retired school teacher and progressive Democrat, left a recent campaign event wishing his congresswoman had taken a tougher stand.\The issue was Social Security. Sanden wanted Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin's assurance that she wouldn't support a proposal to raise the retirement age. Herseth Sandlin wouldn't give him that assurance. Lawmakers, she said, would have a mix of options to keep the retirement system solvent.\Voters such as Sanden have been key in Herseth Sandlin's previous four House victories - including a special election in 2004. In those elections, she deftly assembled majorities that included liberal and moderate Democrats, independents and moderate Republicans. In 2008, she didn't lose a single county to her Republican challenger, despite the fact that John McCain carried the state over Barack Obama.\Two years later, Herseth Sandlin is running in a different environment, this time against state Rep. Kristi Noem. For the first time, she has served a term with large Democratic majorities in Congress and Democratic control of the White House. She knows the agenda advanced by some colleagues hasn't always been popular with many South Dakotans, and occasionally her votes have angered Democrats and Republicans, potentially making it more difficult for her to straddle the political divide.\The past two years have seen a significant change in her private life as well. About a month after winning in 2008, Herseth Sandlin gave birth to Zachary.\She calls him ""my toddler in tow,"" and the ""very active toddler"" sometimes accompanies his mother to the office. On rare occasions, he goes with her to votes at the Capitol. He's traveled the state with her as she campaigns for re-election. He flies back and forth most weekends between Washington and South Dakota on his mother's lap, sometimes traveling alone with her and sometimes accompanied by his father, former Texas Congressman Max Sandlin. The trips, as any parent of young children can attest, can be grueling.\After almost two years, Zachary is on a waiting list at two day cares. Herseth Sandlin and Max use a baby sitter and juggle their schedules to care for him.\""It's all about balance, and anyone who has children knows that it can be difficult to find that balance between family and professional responsibilities,"" she said. ""But we do what most people do - Max and I juggle things, work the schedule around, and we figure it out.""\Building, nurturing a diverse political base in S.D.\During her first run for House in 2002, the farm girl from Houghton was the fresh face with a venerable political heritage. Her grandfather, Ralph Herseth, had been governor. Her grandmother, Lorna, had been secretary of state, and father Lars had been a state lawmaker.\Her loss to former Gov. Bill Janklow in 2002 was respectable, and in 2004 she won back-to-back elections - including a general election in which George Bush prevailed statewide and Tom Daschle fell. That outcome reflected her ability to build a broad coalition of voters, a coalition she's worked hard to maintain.\Democrats took control of Congress in 2006. They solidified their gains in 2008 en route to taking the White House. An ambitious legislative agenda followed.\Republicans have keyed on several Herseth Sandlin votes from the past two years, including the $789 billion stimulus. They've criticized her for supporting deficit-laden spending bills and for voting to raise the national debt ceiling. But the highest-profile campaign issue has been House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whom the GOP has used to nationalize the election.\Ironically, it could be the agenda championed by Pelosi and Obama - whom Herseth Sandlin supported when she was a superdelegate in the 2008 nominating contest - that costs her.\Yet she has also been discriminating in her votes. She was among a group of House Democrats who, in the waning days of the Bush administration, voted against the Troubled Asset Relief Program, popularly known as the Wall Street bailout. Herseth Sandlin does not regret her vote. TARP was only one measure that has helped stabilize the economy, she said, and it can't be viewed in isolation of others, such as the stimulus bill, that she credits for saving jobs.\""I think that, clearly, TARP caused a crisis of confidence in the American public and Congress, and I think that's still lingering,"" she said.\She also voted against the health care reform bill earlier this year, and last year voted against a cap-and-trade energy bill that critics in South Dakota warned would drive up utility costs. While Herseth Sandlin said each proposal contained good provisions, aspects of each would have hurt the state's interests.\Her votes haven't impressed Republicans, who note she opposed an effort to shut down TARP, and that she won't vote to repeal elements of the health reform bill - a rallying cry for the GOP. Repealing the bill, Herseth Sandlin said, is unrealistic. She prefers to improve what's already passed, she said.\Providing a check on liberals, Herseth Sandlin says\Herseth Sandlin co-chairs a moderate group of more than 50 House Democrats known as the Blue Dog Caucus. It's a big enough group that, when combined with Republicans, can stop some major legislation and spending bills advanced by more liberal Democrats.\The group has been effective, Herseth Sandlin said. Some pieces of legislation have not been brought to the House floor because it was clear to Democratic leaders they didn't have the votes.\In August, the House passed a $26.1 billion aid package for states. It started out in spring with a price tag of $140 million and included a host of other spending proposals that would have added to the national debt, Herseth Sandlin said. Blue Dogs held their ground. Eventually, a $26.1 billion package emerged from the Senate. It did not add to the national debt because it was paid for by closing tax loopholes and cutting future Food Stamp benefits. Because of that, the Blue Dogs could support it.\""We worked behind the scenes,"" she said. ""We stuck together. They didn't have the votes for the broader package. They then scaled it back by tens of billions of dollars.""\Norman Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said the Blue Dogs have been a ""critical force"" in moderating the ambitions of more liberal members. Without the group, he thinks the health reform bill would have included a public option and a bigger role for government in the health industry.\""I've watched this very closely, and the answer is Stephanie's right,"" Ornstein said. ""It may be the Blue Dogs haven't stopped legislation, but they influenced very much the substance of the legislation.""\But Herseth Sandlin's decision not to embrace all of the Democratic agenda has sparked trouble with liberal party members. She barely averted a primary challenge this year from Rapid City Dr. Kevin Weiland, who was upset with her vote against health reform. Weiland backed out late after the No. 2 Demo-crat in the House, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, asked him not to run, and Herseth Sandlin agreed not to vote to overturn the landmark legislation.\Gerald Lange, a Democratic state representative, predicted Herseth Sandlin would not be the ""spark to reignite the Democratic Party."" Today, he is more resolute: ""You look at (George) McGovern and the things he stood for, he had the courage to stick with it. I don't think I see those kinds of leadership skills or principles being developed by Stephanie.""\Herseth Sandlin said her generation is different, and so are the challenges: terrorism, government debt and greater dependence on foreign energy sources.\""I happen to represent the more moderate, leaning-conservative wing of the Democratic Party, which I think aligns very well with where a lot of South Dakota Democrats are, and where a lot of independents and moderate Republican voters in South Dakota are.""\Reach reporter Jonathan Ellis at 575-3629.\Herseth Sandlin file\Age: 39.\FAMILY: Married to Max Sandlin with one son, Zachary, age 22 months.\EDUCATION: Bachelor of arts, Georgetown University; master of arts, Georgetown; juris doctorate, Georgetown.\EXPERIENCE: Elected to Congress in a special election in 2004; won subsequent elections in 2004, 2006 and 2008."
20,"Two national columnists address the question: ""Would a tax on carbon emissions hurt the economy?""\YES\Regressive `everything tax' would hurt poor, devastate U.S. economy\BY ANDREW P. MORRISS\CHAMPAIGN, Ill. - Did you enjoy the $3-a-gallon gasoline last summer?\Some members of Congress have plans for a carbon tax that will get you even higher prices. By taxing the carbon content of fuels, they hope to steer Americans toward smaller cars, mass transit and city living and away from SUVs, highways and suburbs.\This is an astonishingly bad idea, one that will harm the economy while hitting the poor the hardest. When you think about it, a tax on transportation is a tax on everything.\A key reason for our economic success is that Americans have access to a broad market for the things we need and the products we make. The logistics revolution of the past 20 years - centered on innovations such as ""just in time"" production - reduced manufacturers' costs and contributes to our prosperity.\Because our food, clothes and the materials with which we build our homes are drawn from this national market, a tax on fuels is a tax on everything. Raising taxes on everything we buy is a quick way to sicken our economy.\Of course, if carbon-tax supporters were proposing a national tax on everything, they'd be laughed out of town as soon as they opened their mouths.\But every can of food, every book and every piece of clothing you buy that wasn't raised next to the store where it was sold will cost more with a carbon tax. The only difference from an explicit ""tax on everything"" is that a carbon tax would be hidden, embedded in the price.\There are three kinds of taxes: Progressive taxes, such as our income tax with its rising rates for higher incomes, take a larger proportional bite from the rich than from the poor. Flat taxes take the same proportion from everyone. Regressive taxes take a higher proportion of the income of the poor than of the rich. Tax experts debate the relative merits of flat and progressive taxes, but there is no case for regressive taxes.\A carbon tax would be regressive because poorer people spend a higher proportion of their incomes on energy-related products. On average, families making between $10,000 and $30,000 a year spend 10 percent of their income on energy, while families making more than $50,000 spend 3 percent. Taxing the poor more than the rich is not just economically dumb, it's morally wrong.\And finally, Congress isn't smart enough to tax carbon.\Carbon-tax proponents argue that people buy less of things that cost more. If carbon emissions harm the environment, tax enthusiasts reason, they can get people to emit less carbon by raising the price through a tax. But the carbon-tax enthusiasts are vague about how much of a tax to impose. That detail matters a great deal.\How much harm does releasing the carbon in a gallon of gasoline cause? No one knows, and no one seriously believes an accurate assessment is possible.\Set the tax too high, and we'll use too little of carbon-based fuels; too low, and we'll use too much.\We've tried allowing politicians to set energy prices before. The energy price controls of the 1970s produced long lines at gasoline stations, natural gas shortages and Jimmy Carter in a cardigan. We can't afford any of those experiences again.\Carbon emissions might be bad for the environment. If they are, cutting carbon emissions should not be done on the backs of the poor through a regressive tax, nor by sending the economy into a tailspin through a tax on everything.\Andrew P.

The French might include a tax on imports of industrial goods from countries that refuse to adopt the Kyoto Protocol (read: the United States) greenhouse-gas emission restrictions after 2012.\Congress should take action to impose a carbon tax on the major polluters: the oil, gas and coal industries; electric utilities; and the manufacturers of gas-guzzling cars, SUVs and pickup trucks.\The new Democratic leadership also should ensure that the new carbon tax is not passed on to consumers by mandating that price and rate controls limit the huge profits rolled up by the energy industry in recent years. Only a bite in profits will force Big Oil, Big Gas, Big Coal and Big Auto to change their ways.\A tax on carbon emissions might cause some economic suffering at first, but that pain will abate quickly as the new tax revenues pour into the Treasury to help subsidize job-producing ethanol filling stations, offshore wind farms, huge solar-power complexes and other eco-friendly energy sources.\While Democrats have been timid about passing tax increases in the past, they should not shy away from this desperately needed levy even if they can't prevent it from being passed on to consumers. It is one that the environmentally concerned Americans who constitute the new majority will be happy to pay to save their beleaguered planet.\Wayne Madsen is a contributing writer for Online Journal (www.onlinejournal.com).

21,"The policy under dispute, cap-and-trade, dates back to the late 1980s and last was a heated topic of debate in 2009. It emerged as a proposed solution to sulfur dioxide emissions, which were causing acid rain.\It was proposed by the Environmental Defense Fund as a replacement for traditional environmental regulations in which the government would ""tell companies how to pollute less,"" said Keith Gaby, communications director for the defense fund's climate and air program.\""In the late 1980s, our organization, working with the Bush administration, came up with a new approach to give businesses more flexibility -- to say, what the government and society cares about is less pollution, so let's let the free market determine how to get there,"" Gaby said.\Under cap-and-trade, the government sets an overall cap on the amount of a particular pollutant that companies are allowed to emit. Then it either gives away or sells permits to pollute up to that cap. Companies with low pollution can profit from this by selling their emissions permits to heavier polluters. Meanwhile, factories or power plants may buy emissions permits instead of making expensive alterations to infrastructure.\The market sets the price of those emissions. Companies such as Natsource are involved in the trading. Most of the papers by U.S. House challenger Matt Varilek, a Democrat, focused on predictions of those permit prices and how different decisions by governments in setting up a cap-and-trade system affect them.\Cap-and-trade systems do raise the cost of the pollutants they cap, something supporters acknowledge and opponents highlight.\Myron Ebell, director of the Center for Energy and the Environment at the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute, called cap-and-trade a political attempt to make environmental regulations look good.\""People will not change their energy use unless they're charged more for energy. The key to cap-and-trade working is that it will cause higher energy prices,"" Ebell said.\He compared cap-and-trade to an alternative method of raising the price of pollution: taxing it.\""The only beneficiaries of a carbon tax are those who produce alternative forms of energy,"" Ebell said.\The first cap-and-trade system, for sulfur dioxide, is largely considered a success, with sulfur levels dramatically reduced and lower-than-expected costs for companies. Ebell, however, argued most of this benefit was because of railroad deregulation making it cheaper to ship low-sulfur coal from Wyoming.\Since the mid-1990s, environmentalists and policymakers have tried to create cap-and-trade systems dealing with emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that a scientific consensus says is contributing to climate change. In 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade program, but it died in the Senate.\David Owen, the president of the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said cap-and-trade programs called the 2009 version ""godawful and too expensive.""\He argued many environmental regulations are worth the extra cost to the economy, as long as they find ""a balancing point."" Cap-and-trade programs for carbon dioxide, Owen said, aren't at that point yet.\Both supporters and opponents don't expect cap-and-trade to be seriously proposed in the United States in the near future.\""Cap-and-trade, we know that's not happening any time soon,"" Gaby said.\Republican Rep. Kristi Noem opposes a carbon tax as well as cap-and-trade. Varilek also said he opposes a carbon tax.\He said he prefers programs to promote wind energy, rather than to penalize fuels such as coal and natural gas, as the best path to address climate change."
22,"South Dakota continues to rank low on an annual scorecard of energy-efficient states, but officials in Pierre say the study's methods are biased toward urban states that accept more government control of the economy.\South Dakota ranked 46th in the study by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, down four spots from last year.\ACEEE examines policies to encourage energy efficiency and assigns points to each state based on six criteria:\Utility public benefits programs (40 percent of the final score).\Transportation policies such as tailpipe emissions standards and programs to reduce driving (18 percent).\Building energy codes (14 percent).\Policies on combined heat and power, which generate electricity and thermal energy in an integrated system (10 percent). The criteria for ranking these systems changed from last year, costing South Dakota points although its policies have not changed.\State government initiatives toward energy efficiency (14 percent).\Appliance and equipment standards (4 percent).\South Dakota received eight points of a possible 50. Unlike most states, South Dakota does not have a standard energy code for new buildings; nor does it have, for example, a binding energy efficiency standard or a mileage-reduction program.\Of surrounding states, Minnesota (ninth), Iowa (11th), Nebraska (42nd) and Montana (25th) fared better on the survey; Wyoming (48th) and North Dakota (50th) were worse.\Massachusetts, praised for its Green Communities energy efficiency program, ranked No. 1 for the second year in a row. California, New York, Oregon and Vermont also did well.\Dusty Johnson, chief of staff to Gov. Dennis Daugaard and a former Public Utilities Commissioner, said the ACEEE's study is weighted heavily in favor of efficiency programs initiated by government. He said he supports energy efficiency programs so long as ""South Dakota families and businesses"" have the choice of whether to participate in them.\""Whether you care about the environment or your pocketbook, energy efficiency is something you should be doing,"" he said. ""The question is, what role should government play in mandating that behavior? ... Is it the government's business to decide how much insulation you've got?""\And, he added, if South Dakota had gotten credit for the energy efficiency programs that count toward its nonbinding renewable energy portfolio, and for the combined heat and power policies for which it traditionally had received points, it would have scored in the 30s.\PUC Chairman Chris Nelson also dismissed the survey.\""I give very little credence to reports that are put together by out-of-state groups that may not have the same goals (as we do) in South Dakota,"" he said.\When a utility proposes a consumer rebate program, for example, Nelson said he applies one test: Will it reduce capital costs for new generation or transmission down the line?\""The bottom line is, every penny of rebate that's paid out is a penny that's coming from a ratepayer,"" he said. ""So you have to be very careful when you're implementing these plans that you're not just shifting money from one pocket to another.""\Chris Johnson, a partner at Johnson Environmental in Sioux Falls, which performs energy audits for construction firms, does see a role for government to support efficiency measures. First up, he said, would be instituting a building energy code.\""That would be the lowest-hanging fruit,"" he said.\Johnson said people worried about the added cost of efficient equipment or of requiring firms to build to a higher standard should know about the substantial savings realized on utility bills. In terms of energy efficiency, he added, ""we're still building homes from the late '90s.""\And Steve Wegman, an analyst for the South Dakota Renewable Energy Association, supports tax credits and other incentives to promote energy efficiency -- insulating buildings properly, for example, or swapping out old, inefficient heating and cooling systems.\""Energy efficiency doesn't mean conservation, going without,"" he said. ""It means building smart.""\Other states\How surrounding states ranked in the 2012 ACEEE study:\Minnesota: 9\Iowa: 11\North Dakota: 50\Nebraska: 42\Wyoming: 48\Montana: 25\S.D. scores\2008: 47\2009: 36\2010: 39\2011: 42\2012: 46\Online\Read the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy study @argusleader.com."
23,"WASHINGTON - Once again, businesses, unions and lawmakers have concluded that the gas tax should be raised to pay for improving the nation's deteriorating and increasingly crowded highways and transit systems.\Once again, there's not much chance Congress will go along.\The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is considering a six-year, $500 billion bill - $450 billion for highways and transit and $50 billion for high-speed rail - that its members say is necessary for economic recovery.\""General Mills in Minnesota loses $2 million for every mile an hour their trucks travel below the speed limit because they have to pay overtime charges and late delivery fees,"" said Rep. Jim Oberstar, D-Minn., committee chairman. ""That's not the kind of transportation we need in America to keep this economy moving, to keep our society mobile. We need a robust investment.""\The current six-year transportation bill, which expired last week, cost $286 billion and was funded primarily by the federal 18.4-cent tax on every gallon of fuel. Unable to agree on a new bill, Congress voted last week to extend the existing legislation for one month.\If nothing changes, states would get about $325 billion during the next six years for highways and transit projects, according to the Federal Highway Administration. Reaching the $450 billion target probably would take about a 10-cent increase in the tax, said Greg Cohen, president of the American Highway Users Alliance.\There seems little chance of that, given President Obama's opposition to the idea and a reluctance among congressional leaders to consider increasing a tax that's remained the same since 1993.\""Let's face it, the American people, right now especially, cannot afford an increase in the gas tax,"" Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., said on the House floor last week. ""Such a tax would hit the unemployed, would hit small businesses, would hit those least able to afford it the hardest.""\Asked what they thought of raising the gas tax, none of South Dakota's three federal lawmakers - Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson, Republican Sen. John Thune and Democratic Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin - ruled it out. That might be because the state gets about $1.97 for every dollar in gas taxes its residents pay - one of the best ratios in the country. But they also said it's time to explore other sources of funding as well.\""While the federal gas tax will likely remain the base of funding the trust fund in this reauthorization, we will need to be innovative and consider a variety of funding options for these programs to remain sustainable into the future,"" Herseth Sandlin said. ""I will continue to work closely with the South Dakota Department of Transportation to evaluate these options and determine the best way forward to meet the unique needs of our state.""\Johnson agrees, and Thune has talked about floating ""Build America Bonds"" that would provide an additional $500 million to South Dakota for infrastructure needs.\Despite the opposition by Cantor and other Republican leaders, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a traditional GOP ally, supports raising the gas tax. But there's little appetite in Congress for doing so when lawmakers have to face the voters again in November 2010.\""Our research shows that the average person is willing to support a gas tax increase for highways,"" Cohen said. ""But in the polarized atmosphere, people are afraid that their vote will hurt them in a hyper-political environment.""\Opposition to raising the gas tax has prompted some to look at other ways to get revenue, such as issuing bonds, raising other fuel-related fees, or even a tax on transit fares. But there's uncertainty about how those ideas would be received and how well they would work.\Contact Ledyard King at lking@gannett.com.\MORE MONEY for roads\Minnesota Democrat James Oberstar, who leader the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has outlined several options for raising additional revenue for highways and transit:\Raise the federal 18.4-cent tax on gasoline and diesel fuel.\Issue 10-year Treasury bonds.\Transfer the cost of fuel tax exemptions from the Highway Trust Fund to the General Fund used to pay for most federal programs.\Increase the per-barrel fee on crude oil and imported gas and diesel fuel.\Impose a transaction tax on speculative trading of crude oil futures.\Implement other user fees, such as increasing the heavy vehicle tax or creating a national vehicle registration fee."
24,"It was with great concern and dismay that I read in the Feb. 18 issue of the Argus Leader about the recent near-miss incident involving a flock of geese and a large jet aircraft. \I, as well as many others, enjoy watching waterfowl. However, when waterfowl or other birds congregate or fly in close proximity to an airfield on a regular basis, it is only a matter of time until a disastrous incident occurs. Perhaps there are many who do not realize that an aircraft impacting with a large bird, or ingesting a large bird into a jet engine, could result in a horrifying disaster. \Even objects such as small rocks, bolts or nuts can destroy a jet engine if ingested. A mid-air loss of an engine in a single-engine military or civilian aircraft is nearly always a guaranteed crash. In a multi-engine aircraft, maybe a crash can be avoided. Normally, only military fighter pilots have the capability to eject from a severely damaged aircraft. Other pilots, crew members and passengers go down with the aircraft. \It is horrifying to speculate on the number of lives that could be lost and the injuries and property damage incurred, should an aircraft crash as a result of contact with one or more of our local pampered waterfowl. \It is time that some people analyze their priorities and make a decision. Is it better to feed the waterfowl and continue to play the odds that their actions could result in one of the worst disasters that Sioux Falls or the region has ever experienced? If the waterfowl feeding proponents elect to continue, in defiance of the odds, are they prepared to take responsibility, should an aircraft disaster caused by collision with waterfowl occur? \I believe that the city ordinance prohibiting feeding and enticing waterfowl to congregate should be diligently enforced and encompass all of Sioux Falls. Stiff, escalating fines and jail sentences should be included in the ordinance. If the existing ordinance is not presently this extensive, I urge that it be amended. The seriousness of the current situation certainly warrants an ordinance with severe penalties for violators. \I see no need to consider draining Covell Lake as a deterrent measure. There is a safe, natural, organic chemical that may be sprayed on water and grass. Waterfowl detest its taste and will soon vacate the area where it is applied. \I urge the City of Sioux Falls to take firm and rapid action on this matter. Let us hope that a terrible disaster may be avoided. \- Dennis L. Hoffman \Renner \State should give part of gas tax to local roads \One of the most important issues confronting the state Legislature is the enormous backlog in road repair. As the Argus Leader has reported, we would have to spend $$@$!2.4 billion to bring all of our state and local roads into good condition. \What has not been widely reported, however, is that the great majority of the road repair backlog consists of local roads. The backlog in local road repair is $$@$!1.8 billion. This is almost three times the backlog in state repairs. \Because we all agree that poor road conditions lead to less economic development, everyone in the Legislature wants to address the problem of local road repair. But some plans are better than others. One proposal, Senate Bill 233, would increase most license plate fees by @$!7 million for local roads. But even with an additional contribution from the federal government of $$@$!8 million, this is not even enough to stabilize the decay of our local roads. \Legislators have considered another proposal. Under Senate Bill 241, license plate fees would be left just as they are today, but an additional 2 cents would be added to the gas tax to fund local roads. This plan would raise @$!8 million in federal money for local roads. \More important, however, is the fact that gas tax revenue grows with increased economic activity better than license-plate-fee revenue. According to the majority leadership, gas tax revenues have increased 5.8 percent annually during the last five years. Revenue from license plate fees has increased only 4.8 percent annually. If we consider those annual increases, 2 cents of the gas tax devoted to local roads provides over @$!12 license plate fee increase, by contrast, would generate less than $$@$!13.5 million annually after the same period. \If we want to invest in the future of our economy, and if we want to invest for the long term, then putting two cents of gas tax revenue into local roads makes better sense than a $$@$!12 plate increase. \And as we all know, good public policies are the ones that make good sense. \- Rep.

Perhaps in a different manner than in the past, but he will be celebrating. \That Clinton was guilty goes without saying. He lied to his wife, his daughter, his friends, the American people, and to the grand jury. He was involved in witness tampering. He had his henchmen destroy the opposition, mesmerize the media and smoke the polls. No one in history has done it more effectively. \In the end, most senators succumbed to the polls. Had the economy soured, things would have changed in a hurry. Unfortunately for the republic, we are drowning in our affluence. Clinton takes credit for it all. Most of us, apparently, believe him. \Now it is ""get even"" time. Anyone who is a possible threat will be deposed. James Carville, former Clinton campaign manager, and Larry Flynt, Hustler magazine publisher, will head the pack. Lawyer Alan Dershowitz and the Hollywood set will assist.

Promise everybody something. Steal from the rich and give to the poor. It's the American way - not. \No one knows what Clinton's legacy will be.

What is Augustana men's basketball doing buried on Page 6, several inches above the Stickney versus Plankinton high school boys' basketball game? \I believe the Argus Leader has some sort of fetish with USD and SDSU athletic coverage, but this paper should be ashamed of its coverage of Augustana athletics on most days. I would bet the Brookings and Vermillion newspapers have never put SDSU or USD home basketball coverage on Page 6, or Page 5, 4, 3 or 2, for that matter. \However, the Argus Leader will consistently put Augustana sporting events inside the section (unless they lose). \- Michael J.

26,"WASHINGTON -- Congress is leaning toward extending funding for transportation projects in South Dakota and other states for a few months while figuring out a long-term deal to pay for road, bridge and other improvements, U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said.\Federal funding for highway construction, maintenance and other surface transportation programs is supposed to come from the Highway Trust Fund, which gets its revenue primarily from the 18.4 cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline and a 24.4 cent-per-gallon tax on diesel fuel. But those tax rates -- last increased in 1993 -- don't generate enough money to cover highway spending. Congress has approved a series of stopgap measures. The most recent extension expires May 31.\Rounds, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said funding likely will be extended through the end of July or August while lawmakers work on a bill that would be in place for up to six years. One option is raising the federal gas tax, but Republican leaders have said that appears unlikely.\""There is no talk about any increase in the federal highway tax at this time,"" Rounds told reporters. ""No talk at all about that.""\The Highway Trust Fund will be short by more than $160 billion over the next 10 years, according to estimates. As cars have become more fuel efficient, less fuel is used, reducing tax revenue flowing into the trust fund.\Labor and business groups are urging Congress to focus on a long-term deal.\""Years of congressional inaction on a long-term surface transportation bill has harmed our economy,"" Ed Wytkind, the president of the AFL-CIO Transportation Trades Department, said Wednesday. Congress needs to ""get to work on a robust long-term bill that expands investments and job creation, and is paid for with a sustainable revenue stream.""\Instead of boosting the gas tax, a more likely scenario is taxing up to $2 trillion in corporate money being held in banks overseas.\The tax rate for companies to bring cash back to the United States is 39 percent. To boost revenue, Congress could offer a much lower temporary tax rate for a few years for companies that voluntarily return profits to the U.S., a process known as repatriation, and dedicate some or all of the money to the highway fund.\The highway system is vital in areas such as South Dakota, where cities and towns are far apart, and local economies are dependent on tourism and exporting goods and services outside of the state for income.\Average annual spending on highway and transit projects in South Dakota on the federal, state and local levels totaled about $778 million from 2007 to 2011, a fraction of the $207 billion nationwide, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.\South Dakota, which has more than 80,000 miles of highways, roads and streets, drew about 37 percent of its funds from the federal government and 63 percent from state and local sources. That placed it among the highest states in its federal share compared but near the bottom in state and local support.\Bob Burns, a retired political science professor from South Dakota State University, said the state has traditionally received more from the Highway Trust Fund than it has paid in. He speculated that placing a lower tax rate on corporate funds held overseas could woo Democratic support.\""(The Highway Trust Fund) is certainly a beneficial program for construction and maintenance of South Dakota highways and bridges,"" Burns said. ""We have so many miles and miles of highway per capita and tax alone tends to give us an advantage in receiving funding back."""
27,"Projects scaled back as S.D. trims $$@$!46M from contracts \BY TERRY WOSTER \Argus Leader \PIERRE - South Dakota contractors who built at a record pace as state and federal road money grew in recent years may be forced to scale back as the state cuts $$@$!46 million from construction contracts next yeary. \Jim Keyes, executive director of the Associated General Contractors, said many highway builders expanded their crews and operations to respond to an increased amount of federal cash that was matched by a 4-cent-a-gallon increase in the state gasoline tax. \""The construction program has been at a record level the last couple of years, but with the decreased amount of travel and corresponding drop in gas purchases and tax revenue, the state is projecting less activity, and that will affect our people,'' Keyes said. ""We've been told it could be about $$@$!57 million over a three-year period. That obviously does affect contractors, but we're all in the same economy."" \The budget Gov. Bill Janklow proposed for the fiscal year that begins next July projects a @$!3442 million in fiscal 2001, and @$!2762 million next year. As recently as fiscal 1997, the program budget was $$@$!181 million. \A combination of state motor-fuel tax and federal highway money is used for construction projects. Last summer, Department of Transportation officials began warning that gas-tax revenue was lagging because of rising prices at the pump and a sluggish tourism season. \The state works from a five-year plan on construction and maintenance projects. Engineers and planners have been changing priorities to find projects that can wait all or part of a construction season as the revenue slump continues, said Dennis Landguth, deputy transportation secretary. Department officials will talk with contractors and community leaders about any changes in the schedulesd. \""You're talking about a number of projects that could be affected, and it hurts,"" Landguth said. \The cutback also could reduce revenue to the contractors excise tax, a 2 percent fee on much of the construction work done in South Dakota. That tax, adopted in the late 1970s, has become the third-largest source of general-fund revenue, behind the sales tax and video lottery. The tax will produce about $$@$!54 million next year. \Losing the tax on @$!900,000. \Several contractors geared up for the increased pace of road work a few years ago when a new federal highway bill offered more money if states could match the federal share. South Dakota legislators raised the gas tax and increased other fees to smake that possible. \""The state came to contractors and said they should get bigger, more aggressive,"" Keyes said. ""To a certain extent, we bought into that. This is no slam at all on the department. They can't control the economy. It just means for a period of time, we'll have to go along with this direction of reduced activity."" \The situation could change if Congress adopts an economic stimulus package now being debated, he said. Such a package would include more highway money because such investments are long-term ways to create economic activity and employment. \An appropriations bill in final stages of passage also includes some additional cash for roads. \""I think in the end, the construction program in South Dakota will be somewhat smaller, and we'll have to deal with that,"" Keyes said. \Landguth said the five-year construction plan is a fluid document that can change sfor many reasons, including shifts in revenues, legal issues and the environment. \""You might have a project you think is going ahead and run into a right-of-way issue or an environmental concern that delays it,"" he said. ""We have shelf projects that are ready to be activated if conditions change."" \He also said the department has attempted in recent years to put more of its money into projects, so it has no cushion for economic declines. \""The department used to hold back some of the construction funds, but we've tried to do a good job of putting all of the money into the market,"" Landguth said. \That approach puts all available money into projects, but that means that when the economy dips, the agency must pull back on the work it planned. \Reach reporter Terry Woster at 605-224-2760 or twoster@midco.net Pierre Midwest\SIOUX EMPIRE; Pg. 1B"
28,"BY ORRIE D. SWAYZE\Our governor's bill to double the taxes on E85 sold through blender pumps failed, yet he inappropriately continues to collect this huge tax increase as though his legislation passed. Ironically, his tax increase makes gasoline a lower-taxed product than blends of E85 at the blender pump.\The energy content of E85 is less than gasoline. Thus, it takes more gallons of E85 to go the same number of miles as gasoline. At half E85 or approximately E40, the mileage loss is approximately 13 percent. Simple math says the governor's new 20 cents per gallon tax rate for a blend such as half E85 really goes to 23 cents/gallon or a penny more than gasoline.\South Dakota is the nation's leader in creating new blender-pump markets for E85. These new E85 markets are our only opportunity to break through the E10 blend wall and put back a billion dollars annually into the South Dakota economy. The math is easy because ethanol markets have plummeted a dollar per gallon vs. gasoline prices as the E10 blend-wall approaches. We have given the federal 50-cents per gallon blenders credit to gasoline marketers plus another 50-cents per gallon because the E10 blend wall has strangled marketing opportunities for our billion-gallon South Dakota ethanol industry. Importantly, blender pumps provide all consumers access to E85 at today's bargain prices.\Gov. Mike Round's legislation failed, yet he continues to illegally double the taxes on E85. Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty has not followed by dreaming up a self-serving interpretation of state gas tax law to raise taxes on E85 sold through blender pumps.\Reality clearly tells us that gasoline-only consumers live in the past and burden our environment and economy. Ironically, our governor unwittingly raised E85 taxes to provide consumer tax incentives to use OPEC's gasoline rather than South Dakota's ethanol.\MY VOICE\Orrie Swayze, 64, of Wilmot, is a farmer.\Guest columns, published under the heading ""My Voice,"" should be 500-700 words.

29,"washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.\A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.\The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.\The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.\The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.\The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.\Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.\Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs."

31,"Too many special-interest items in bill, senator says\BY FAITH BREMNER\Argus Leader Washington Bureau\WASHINGTON - Sen. John Thune continued Wednesday to help his Republican colleagues block legislation that would extend a tax credit for South Dakota wind producers, give the state more money to build and repair roads, and allow residents to keep deducting state sales taxes on their federal income tax returns because he said it includes too many special-interest items added by Democrats.\Thune said he opposed the legislation because it has provisions that Republicans don't support - $1.2 billion for New York City to build a new rail line to John F. Kennedy International Airport and $24 billion in tax increases for highly paid executives and multinational corporations.\In addition to extending the wind energy production tax credit, which expires at the end of the year, the legislation also would extend deductions for state sales taxes, college tuition, teacher expenses and businesses that hire Native Americans. It also would increase a tax credit for gas stations that install E85 fuel pumps to $50,000.\The legislation also contains a provision that would add $8 billion to the Highway Trust Fund, which is expected to run short this year because of lagging gas tax revenues.\Thune, a big backer of wind energy, accused Democrats of playing election-year politics instead of trying to reach a bipartisan solution.\""I think (Democrats) want to be able to depict the Republicans as blocking these things because they know the tax extenders are popular,"" Thune said.\Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson accused Republicans of playing political games in holding up tax breaks that would benefit South Dakotans.\""We have an opportunity to pass the renewable energy tax credits, which have been blocked more than four times this year by the minority,"" Johnson said. ""With gas at $4 a gallon, we should not turn our backs on investment in renewable energy that would make us less dependent on foreign sources of oil.""\Environmental groups say Republicans are blocking the legislation because of their feud with Democrats over amendments Republicans want to offer on an energy speculation bill. The amendments would open up more oil drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf and Alaska.\""I don't think $1.2 billion in a $100 billion package is a reason to throw the renewable energy industry under the bus,"" said Bob Schreiber, spokesman for Environment America. ""Without the (wind energy) production tax credit, investors are already pulling out of projects.

32,"Political scientist warns of knee-jerk aversion to tax changes\BY TERRY WOSTER\twoster@midco.net\PIERRE - Legislators looking for money to build roads might find it impossible to convince South Dakota residents that a tax increase is needed, a university professor says.\A legislative committee this summer is reviewing highway needs and exploring ways to finance future work. The panel will meet in late September to hear what has been described as a menu of revenue options. Ken Blanchard, political scientist at Northern State University, has doubts about how far lawmakers will get.\""South Dakota, more than some states nationally, has a strong resistance to tax changes,"" he said.\Many South Dakotans feel the state has plenty of money and workers, even though ""it is consistently starved for revenue,"" he said. ""In that environment, trying to convince people that we really do have a problem, it's tough.""\The legislative committee toils at a time when gas taxes are failing to keep up with state and national highway needs. State DOT officials say they're in a preservation mode, and they predict that South Dakota's generally good roads will deteriorate.\A Sioux Falls Republican experienced firsthand the sort of tax aversion Blanchard described.\Rep. Shantel Krebs, a member of the study committee, talked recently of the possibility that the panel would look at a tax on vehicle miles traveled - an idea being discussed in several states after a pilot project in Oregon.\Krebs called it one of many options the state could consider. She also said the panel must look at ways to cut spending and make sure available fuel-tax money is targeted directly to road work.\""A lot of people thought I was advocating the vehicle mile tax, which I wasn't,"" Krebs said Friday. ""I was saying that we need to look at everything, revenue and spending.""\Sen. Cooper Garnos, R-Presho, is chairman of the study committee. He said that if panelists are reluctant to talk openly about any proposal, ""I'll have failed my job as chairman. ... This committee needs to be open to any idea, whether it's a vehicle miles tax, raising the gas tax or cutting programs.""\Oregon lawmakers haven't decided whether to implement a vehicle miles tax beyond the pilot project. One estimate from that state says it would take as much as 20 years to implement because the needed mileage-tracking devices would would be added to new vehicles rather than retrofitted into cars and vans on the road already.\In South Dakota, even if the Garnos panel called for a tax change, it would be far from a done deal.

34,"is a vote for status quo\I have to agree with Linda Daugaard -- you can not change Dennis Daugaard, so if you liked the last four years, you should vote him back into the office.\Let's take a review to see how South Dakota is doing.\Well, we are 51st in teacher pay. Gov. Daugaard said it is the local schools' problem, because he gives the districts the money and he doesn't know why they don't hire the teachers they need.\South Dakota ranks 39th in the money it sends to the local school districts, so maybe I can see how it is difficult to hire teachers, pay the utilities, pay for the gas to bus students long distances. Some schools just can't stretch their budgets far enough, so some schools have classes four days a week to save gas money. I know that is what Hot Springs, Custer and Irene are doing to balance the budget. Some schools are talking about three days of school.\South Dakota must have some of the laziest citizens, because Daugaard said if you work a 30-hour-per-week job, you can get all kinds of health insurance. South Dakota has 48,000 uninsured working poor. It has the highest percentage of two-parent working families. The state has a lot of food stamp users and reduced-lunch receivers. No need to raise the minimum wage -- no need to expand Medicaid.\How about county roads and bridges? Some counties are allowing some roads to go back to dirt roads -- no money for gravel. Daugaard doesn't want to raise the gas tax for roads. He doesn't want to raise any taxes. Bridges already in critical need for repair will just have to wait. I guess it could be worse.\South Dakota did rank No. 2 in the nation in something. It is the second most corrupt state in the nation. The governor thinks things are just fine the way they are, and Mrs. Daugaard can assure you that he is not going to change, and she should know, because he has not changed in three decades.\Dee Halverson\Sioux Falls\Did Weiland\solicit big money?\Democratic Senate candidate Rick Weiland's campaign theme is ""Take it Back.""\One might conclude after viewing the far-fetched ads, that he will single-handedly increase Social Security benefits, raise the minimum wage and invest in education.\With that much clout, he should be able to dial up Mayday PAC and instruct them to take the big money back and stay out of South Dakota.\Will he man up and publicly denounce the PAC's entry into the South Dakota media? I doubt it.\Weiland was the former director of National Finance for Tom Daschle. It would be interesting to have him describe his scope of duties while holding that position. Someone should ask him whether he solicited big money from out-of-state during his stint as the director of National Finance.\Emmet Rogers\Sioux Falls\Facing the fear\of same-sex marriage\There has been much discussion about marriage equality in light of the lawsuit filed in South Dakota and, most recently, the Supreme Court's decision to not hear five same-sex marriage cases. The debate raises the question, why are some people so opposed to marriage equality?\The definition of marriage is one of the most prevailing arguments against marriage equality. But redefining marriage is not a bad thing. We have already redefined it before. Back in 1967, the Supreme Court ruled that bans on interracial marriage were unconstitutional. The truth is, marriage is virtually part of every culture, society and religion. It doesn't belong to any one group to define what it means for the rest of the country, nor the world.\Another argument against marriage equality is the effect on children. It is argued, that same-sex families are not a good environment for children and that it is dangerous. The problem is there is no evidence to support this claim, but there is evidence showing the opposite is true.\In the U.S., there are almost 400,000 children without permanent families living in foster care. Why wouldn't we support a loving family system that same-sex marriage can provide?\The last motivating force behind the anti-same-sex marriage argument is that of homophobia. Many are afraid of what changes same-sex marriage would bring and what challenges it brings to their world. Many think attraction to the opposite sex can be cured.\Such responses to homosexuality and bisexuality cause deep psychological and emotional scars, leading to a higher suicide rate among LGBT people and higher rates of homeless among LGBT youth. Such answers are not loving -- they are based in a fear of the unknown.\Same-sex couples want to be able to marry the person they love, share in their joys and sorrow and raise a family. Is that so monstrous?\Thomas Christiansen\Sioux Falls"
35,"BY TERRY WOSTER \Argus Leader \VERMILLION - Making a stronger effort to negotiate in good faith with Indian tribes in South Dakota could help improve race relations in the state, a Democratic candidate for governor said Wednesday. \South Dakota also needs to recognize that prejudice exists, Jim Abbott of Vermillion said during a candidates' forum on the campus of the University of South Dakota. \""There's no way you can say we don't have any prejudice,"" he said in answer to a question about how to avoid future incidents such as one in which two Miller youths are charged with shooting at a carload of girls from the Crow Creek Indian Reservation. ""The first step in eradicating prejudice is to accept it and move on."" \Abbot said he doesn't know if race was a factor in the Crow Creek incident, but he said South Dakota must work to improve its relations with Indian tribes. He said he doesn't think the state has always dealt with tribes the way it deals with neighboring states, which also have certain sovereignty rights. \""We need to negotiate with them fairly under law,"" he said. \State Sens. Jim Hutmacher of Oacoma and Ron Volesky of Huron are the other candidates for the Democratic nomination for governor in the June 4 primary. The Political Science League at USD sponsored the forum. \Volesky, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, said more trust must be developed between Native Americans and non-Indians. \""We need to put aside the bitterness, we need to many times put aside the wounds of the past in order to have a future,"" he said. \Hutmacher said better relationships can be built if both sides work at it. \""The Native Americans have been here longer than we have,"" he said. ""They're here to stay, and we have to work with them."" \One of the recent issues among Republican candidates for governor has been a fight between Steve Kirby of Sioux Falls and Attorney General Mark Barnett over pledges not to raise taxes. The trio of Democratic candidates said they wouldn't get into that kind of promise-making. \""Never is a long time,"" Hutmacher said. ""With the state of roads in this state, I think it's totally irresponsible to say 'no, we're not going to ever raise taxes.' "" \Volesky said emergencies such as the flooding and blizzards of 1997 could occur again. Lawmakers raised the gas tax then to match money for roadwork and other cleanup programs. He also noted that the state raised the sales tax for a period of time in the early 1980s to purchase a core rail line that was being abandoned by private companies. \""Would a governor say, 'Well, I signed a tax pledge, so I guess I'm going to have to leave the roads for the next governor?' "" he asked. \Abbot said he wouldn't sign a tax pledge, either. He pointed out that the state constitution requires a property-tax increase if the government budget isn't balanced. If he were governor, he said he'd work with legislators from both political parties to avoid a tax increase with program cuts or changes in priorities. \""If that doesn't happen, then the governor has to put a balanced budget on the table, period,"" he said. \None of the candidates supported state-ordered consolidation of schools, and each said South Dakota needs to improve pay for teachers. \""We have for far too long underpaid teachers,"" Volesky said. ""The only promise I'll make is after four years, we will not be last in this country in teacher pay."" \Abbott didn't make the same guarantee but said, ""I would hope we could do better than be 50th or 49th in teacher salaries."" \He said the decision on whether to consolidate schools should be made locally, but he suggested the state should examine the standards it sets for schools. The standards should spell out what the state expects every student to know to be able to graduate from high school, Abbott said. \""We (should) create standards that relate to what you know rather than how many weeks or months you sat in the chair,"" he said. \Districts could review the standards and make their own decisions on whether they could operate a school that allowed students to meet the requirements, Abbott said. \Hutmacher said an increase in the state's minimum wage could encourage students to remain in South Dakota. \""The base needs to come up,"" he said. ""If you push the base up, the rest will come up accordingly."" \On other topics: \Volesky said juvenile corrections could be improved by a change in public attitude. ""We need to change from retribution and punishment to prevention and redemption,"" he said. If elected, he said he would outlaw boot camps. \Abbott said that without significant economic development, South Dakota won't have the jobs to keep its young people. And he said simply continuing or expanding past development strategies won't work. ""We have to figure out where South Dakota should go, not where it might go or where it will go if we don't do anything,"" he said. \Hutmacher said economic growth can be encouraged without damaging the environment. ""We can't be so restrictive that business can't operate, and so farmers can't operate,"" he said. \Reach Terry Woster at 605-224-2760 or twoster@midco.net Vermillion Midwest\SIOUX EMPIRE; Pg. 1B"
36,"Gov. Mike Rounds won't be on the ballot this year, but his leadership is a pivotal issue among the five Republicans running to replace him in the June 8 primary.\Rounds is term-limited and will leave office with a state budget deficit projected at $85 million to $90 million. The making of this deficit has become a point of contention in the GOP primary. The narrative in the contest is whether the deficit has been out of his control, the result of a downturn in the national economy. Or, could the governor have made different decisions when times were good?\Amid this backdrop is Dennis Daugaard, Rounds' lieutenant governor and choice to succeed him. Because of his almost eight years in the office, Daugaard is linked to the policy decisions made during that era.\Daugaard said the responsibility for the state's budget problem lies squarely with the national recession.\""I don't think it's a consequence of the governor or the Legislature overspending or mismanaging the budget,"" he said.\For other candidates, different approaches\But his opponents have, to varying degrees, said they would have handled things differently than Rounds and, by extension, Daugaard.\Dave Knudson, the Senate majority leader, said he does not think the primary is a referendum on Rounds. But Knudson has been critical of Rounds' leadership style. For example, he said, the state's highway system is deteriorating, and Knudson said if he were governor, he would have tried to rally enough support for an increase in the state gas tax and license plate fees. Last year, Knudson supported a 4-cent per gallon increase as well as a $10 increase in license plate fees to help catch up on state and county road maintenance. The effort failed.\Knudson has tried to frame himself as the candidate best equipped to lead a state that faces challenges. He has practiced law for 35 years, and he served as former Gov. Bill Janklow's chief of staff and had a nearly eight-year legislative career. He has been at the center of several policy initiatives, including the school aid formula.\""I think that's a unique combination,"" he said.\Former Brookings Mayor Scott Munsterman said he would have handled the state's budget problems differently. When Brookings faced a deficit equal to 10 percent of its general fund, the city rolled back its revenue estimates and made a policy not to use reserves to pay for ongoing expenses. The city also pegged its growth rate to the consumer price index to ensure the government wouldn't grow faster than the economy. The state should have had a similar policy, he said, but did the opposite, and he blames both the Legislature and executive branch.\""All you have to do is look at the situation the state is in today, with us facing a $100 million deficit,"" he said. ""With the leadership the state has had, administratively and legislatively, has brought us to this point - eight years of structural deficits.""\Munsterman notes that many high-ranking officials in Pierre have donated to Daugaard. It's an indication to Munsterman that Daugaard won't make changes to the way the state handles fiscal matters.\Proposing a harder line on state spending\Gordon Howie, a state senator from Rapid City, has been perhaps the most scathing critic of the administration and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature. Howie was the only Republican to vote against the most recent budget proposal because he argues the state should have frozen spending to the previous year's revenue.\It would have meant an additional $32 million in cuts.\If he'd been governor, he said he would have vetoed the budget. He called it a ""mistake"" because it increased spending at a time when the economy is in the dumps.\""In the last year or two, we've seen politicians turn this economy upside down,"" Howie said. ""So we're in a different environment than we've been.""\Howie said he is the only candidate who would stop state government from growing.\More cautious in use of budget reserves\Ken Knuppe, the only candidate in the contest who doesn't have a political pedigree, is more gentle in his criticism.\Still, the state used reserves during the Rounds era seven of eight years. In some of those years, the state used reserves even when it saw healthy revenue growth, and officials should have been more responsible.\""What I've learned, and it's worked for me in business, is you save in the good years to get by in the bad years,"" said Knuppe, a rancher from Buffalo Gap.\But Daugaard said there's a good defense for the administration. When he and Rounds took office, the state was looking at a $50 million deficit because of the repeal of the state inheritance tax. Rather than make drastic cuts, the administration decided to use reserves, including some extra federal money, to ease out of the deficit until other revenue sources caught up to the deficit.\The Legislature also deserves blame, particularly in 2008, for cherry-picking rosy revenue estimates.\""To maintain that the governor has been spending recklessly or mismanaging the budget really is a superficial argument,"" he said.\Knudson, in particular, has criticized Daugaard's leadership.\""Looking at his legislative career, he wasn't a really active leader in the Legislature,"" Knudson said.\Daugaard has been careful not to criticize Rounds in public. He said last week that Rounds should have engaged in ""a little more fiscal chiding"" when lawmakers put together a budget using rosy budget numbers.\Cross between Janklow, Rounds, Daugaard says\How would he be different than Rounds? Daugaard said his life experiences make him more fiscally conservative. He sees himself as a cross between Rounds and Janklow. Not as big a micromanager as Janklow, but more engaged in state agencies and their decision than Rounds.\In internal polling, Daugaard has enjoyed a big lead. If he prevails next week, he will meet Democrat Sen. Scott Heidepriem in the general election. Heidepriem already has made Rounds' stewardship of the state the central issue of his campaign.\Daugaard could find himself defending those eight years for the next five months.\Reach reporter Jonathan Ellis at 575-3629.\Watch interviews with gubernatorial candidates\Click here to watch each candidates' interview with the Argus Leader Editorial Board."

Tom Daschle's opposition to Judge Charles Pickering for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. \Judge Pickering has been given the highest rating by the American Bar Association. But his qualifications have nothing to do with Daschle's opposition. The People for the American Way (a radical leftist organization) gave its report on Judge Pickering. \The judge once gave advice to a prisoner facing over two decades of prison that it's not too late to get his act together. He could join Prison Fellowship Ministry started by Chuck Colson. This organization has reduced the recidivism rate from 41 percent to 14 percent. But giving advice like this is too much for Daschle. \It is apparent that Daschle finds federal judges acceptable only if they are radically pro-abortion or anti-religious. Their ideology is the litmus test for Daschle. Everywhere we go, people talk about how liberal South Dakota has become thanks to Daschle. \South Dakotans need to come out in droves this next election to give balance to the U.S. Senate and elect Republican Rep.

Hallwas, mayor \North Sioux City \A vote for Volesky is a reconciliation vote \I must take issue with Iowan Sturg Van Vugt's political attack on my Lakota brother state Sen. Ron Volesky in the Dec. 25 Argus Leader in opposition to Volesky's campaign to be governor of South Dakota. \While Volesky is certainly a champion for a pollution-free environment and has real concerns for working-class people, Volesky is not anti-business as Van Vugt goes on to erroneously assert. A close review of Volesky's voting record in the South Dakota Legislature will reveal that Volesky has consistently voted in the best interests of South Dakota business. \Van Vugt's irrational attack on Volesky can only be attributed to the senator's voting record in favor of clean air and the family farmer. \As Volesky's great-great- great- grandfather Chief Sitting Bull was a great inspirational leader of the Lakota people in the 19th century, so will Volesky be a great inspirational governor for all South Dakotans in the new millennium in fulfillment of reconciliation between the indigenous and Anglo people of South Dakota as initiated by our dearly departed and sorely missed South Dakota Gov. George Speaker Mickelson. A vote for Volesky will be a vote for reconciliation of all the people of South Dakota. \Harry G.

If not that, it would be property tax, but there is a freeze on that. The federal government gives grants to the police department for updating equipment, and we end up having to match it. There isn't money in the general fund or budget, so what do we do? Raise taxes. This is getting to the point that I get chills up and down my spine every time I hear about a gift from the government because it is going to cost me in the end. \We have this slogan ""just say no"" to drugs.

38,"The first completed mile of South Dakota 100 in eastern Sioux Falls shows how new infrastructure can lead to economic growth.\""It's the beginning of a new era out there,"" said Steve Van Buskirk of Van Buskirk Cos. ""I really believe that.""\Despite its promise, completing S.D. 100 likely is more than a decade away. It's one of several large transportation projects in Sioux Falls that's on an uncertain timetable and faced with funding challenges.\In the southwest, a proposed interchange at 85th Street and Interstate 29 faces similar delay.\Advocates of both projects argue the road improvements are good tools to grow the city and state out of the economic downturn.\The segment of newly developed S.D. 100, between 10th and 26th streets, previously was a stretch of Powderhouse Road. The expanded urban street helped spawn Dawley Farm Village, which includes a retail area with Target, Kohl's, Century East movie theater and other planned stores and restaurants.\""It was imperative that road got done,"" said Craig Lloyd of Lloyd Cos., who co-developed the retail project. ""Without that, Target wouldn't have built, Kohl's wouldn't have gone, and you wouldn't have a lot of the good things that are going on out there.""\S.D. 100 is considered a regional transportation corridor. Eventually, it is planned to stretch 17 miles from Interstate 90 in the northeast corner of the city, around the southern tip of Sioux Falls before connecting with a similar stretch of roadway on the west side.\""We're not asking the state to come in and build a road for the sake of building a road,"" said Mark Cotter, the city's public works director. ""It's managed growth, and that starts with the sewer, which is built out, and now the next thing we need to extend is the street system.""\A new study by the city planning department found that a completed S.D. 100 corridor might hold 13 employment centers by 2035. Planners calculated that 1,025 people work in the area, which could grow to 21,680 employees in 25 years.\""That will mirror what we've found along interstate interchanges,"" said Mike Cooper, the city's director of planning and building services. ""Once we complete those, they become major magnets for development.""\Under a 2005 agreement with the city, the state agreed to construct S.D. 100 in exchange for the city assuming maintenance of Minnesota Avenue and 10th, 11th and 12th streets.\The agreement doesn't set a completion deadline for S.D. 100; it depends on funding.\""For the last few years, because of funding reasons, we've been focused very strongly on trying to preserve the condition of existing roads, and our ability to add to our system for development purposes has been rather restrictive,"" said Darin Bergquist, secretary of the South Dakota Department of Transportation.\The next segment of S.D. 100 is planned for 2012 and would improve the existing Highway 11 south to 69th Street. But no additional construction in the area is included in the state's five-year plan.\""I'm under the impression development has slowed down a little right now,"" Bergquist said. ""Many of the developers want to see South Dakota 100 in place when the economy turns around so they're ready to move down there. Unfortunately, our ability to have it in place in that short time frame probably isn't very realistic.""\Developers and business advocates are banding together to lobby for the project.\Their first goal is a connection to I-90, which they say will draw out-of-state traffic.\""The idea of a northeast gateway to the city is the biggest game-changer at the moment,"" said Joel Dykstra, who represents a group of area property owners that includes Rob Broin. The investors own 192 acres on both sides of S.D. 100 between Madison Street and I-90.\""If you could wave a wand, this is where you want to open the city,"" Dykstra said. ""It fundamentally shifts traffic.""\Along S.D. 100 between Arrowhead Parkway and Madison Street, C-Lemme Co. is developing a combination of homes, apartments, retail and office space. Foss Fields involves 320 undeveloped acres, but without a connection to I-90 it also might struggle to develop.\""We need to prove the benefits,"" said Joel Ingle of C-Lemme.\Ingle and Dykstra are hoping to work with other area landowners and local officials to advocate for the road project at the state and federal levels.\One proponent is the Sioux Falls Area Chamber of Commerce, which joined with city officials earlier this year to meet with state officials about the project.\""As the city continues to grow, you have to grow business with it,"" said Bob O'Connell, the chamber's director of public affairs and communications. ""This is a perfect plan to promote growth in a way that's logical and progressive.""\Proposed interchange\Another major transportation project involves improving access and traffic flow along I-29 in southwest Sioux Falls.\The city and state began studying the area in 2004 and looked at various alternatives for crossings involving 69th and 85th streets. The result was a series of planned improvements culminating in an interchange at 85th Street.\""It's critical because it will provide an additional route for people that have to use 57th and Louise,"" Cotter said. ""We've maximized the use of that intersection, and we need to provide additional routes to move traffic and reduce driver delay.""\A major project this year will be an initial step toward justifying the interchange. The state and city will build an I-229 overpass and extend Solberg Avenue from 59th to 69th streets. A separate project also will construct the nearby intersection of 69th and Tallgrass Avenue.\The state plans to reconstruct the junction of interstates 29 and 229 in 2013.\""That's going to completely redo the intersection, add additional lanes and raise I-29 near 85th Street so we have it in a way that we can in the future accommodate 85th Street crossing the interstate,"" Bergquist said.\Before an interchange can move forward, federal officials must agree it is justified at the proposed location. The city plans to spend the next six months finishing documentation before submitting it to the Federal Highway Administration.\""We have to show the timing of when we will build out the local network of streets to complement it with an interchange,"" Cotter said. ""It's a new federal requirement because they want to make sure that you tie the local network in with the timing of the interchange.""\Without an interchange, additional development in the area likely will stall. Sanford Health, which owns 185 acres nearby, proposed a research park for the land several years ago.\""As that infrastructure development becomes more clear, we'll assess how that fits into our development plans,"" said Kurt Brost, Sanford's director of real estates services. ""We see it as a very valuable property for our future needs, but exact details will come into play as we know more about what others are doing.""\Brost said it's too soon to say whether the land would still be used for research purposes. Since proposing the research park, Sanford bought the former Hutchinson Technology Inc. manufacturing building in the northeast corner of Sioux Falls and converted it to a corporate headquarters and research center.\""I don't think that precludes what we will do (in the southwest), but that will definitely be part of the discussion now where it wasn't before,"" Brost said.\Lloyd Cos. also owns an adjacent 50 acres and envisions an upscale retail development.\""There's a definite desire for companies to have interstate exposure,"" Lloyd said.\The company gets calls about its land every few months, he said.\""The problem is they say we still have gravel roads up there and people don't want to put up a $10 (million) to $15 million building and have a gravel road"" leading to it, Lloyd said.\Without an interchange, he said, the area could be limited to apartments or offices.\""With an interchange it becomes hotels, restaurants, retail, office area,"" Lloyd said. ""If you throw the research park in, the elevation becomes really big. We probably have six or seven retailers that would like to come to Sioux Falls, but they want to be exposed to I-29. So they're waiting.""\Funding struggles\Like S.D. 100, the 85th Street interchange depends on federal and state funding.\A complete S.D. 100 is estimated to cost $200 million. An interchange at 85th, along with other necessary street improvements comes in at an estimated $96 million.\Tackling either one means battling a budget environment of shrinking revenues, a federal moratorium on congressional earmarks and the state's need to maintain the current system.\Two-thirds of the state Department of Transportation's budget comes from federal funds. The revenue received is based on a formula that currently returns two dollars to the state for every one dollar South Dakota taxpayers send to the federal government.\The formula is determined through federal legislation. It was included in the most recent five-year transportation authorization bill in 2005 and it's up for discussion this year as Congress seeks to reauthorize funding.\""We've battled that every time,"" said U.S. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D. ""We band together and put together a good regional coalition, and we've been very fortunate.""\Larger states, however, also are getting more united in their advocacy for a different formula, he said.\""We'll put together our group and do the best we can in advocating for a strong formula that recognizes a transportation system has to be a national system,"" Thune said. ""Even though we don't have the same population, if you can't get from New York to Seattle, moving freight across the country, you won't have competitive economics.""\Compounding the funding challenge is a federal highway trust fund that has required a supplement from the federal general fund since the recession hit in full force in 2008. There's little appetite in Washington, D.C., to continue that practice, officials said.\""It's very scary to us right now,"" Bergquist said. ""If they develop a program around the existing revenues, the size of the program will go down 25 percent.""\Past transportation authorizations also have included funding for projects added by members of Congress. In 2005, the bill included funding to relocate railroad tracks in downtown Sioux Falls. But a two-year moratorium on earmarks might mean no such projects will be included in the next bill.\The federal transportation bill has expired, and the state's funding is being delivered through continuing resolutions, which Bergquist said makes long-term planning difficult. Unless a new authorization is approved this fall, he said the bill likely would be postponed until 2013.\""Then our intent would be to sit down with the city to make longer-term plans,"" he said.\The rest of the state DOT's revenue primarily comes from the state gas tax and vehicle excise tax. This year, legislators increased the vehicle licensing fee, providing an additional $2.8 million for Minnehaha and Lincoln counties and their respective cities.\That funding likely will be directed toward maintenance needs, along with the majority of the state's transportation budget. Philosophically, the state believes well-maintained roads cost less long-term and has prioritized maintenance over expansion, Bergquist said.\Without expansion, Sioux Falls' traffic projections show extreme congestion possibilities by 2035.\In 2008, Sioux Falls drivers collectively experienced 25,000 hours in delays every day, according to the city. By 2035, even with planned improvements, that number will grow to 74,000 hours based on population growth. Without improvements, the number skyrockets to 387,000 daily delay hours.\Link\A look at the city's long-range transporation plan: Direction 2035\Link\Map of Sioux Falls 2011 infrastructure projects"

Eventually, it is planned to stretch 17 miles from Interstate 90 in the northeast corner of the city, around the southern tip of Sioux Falls before connecting with a similar stretch of roadway on the west side.\""We're not asking the state to come in and build a road for the sake of building a road,"" said Mark Cotter, the city's public works director. ""It's managed growth, and that starts with the sewer, which is built out, and now the next thing we need to extend is the street system.""\A new study by the city planning department found that a completed S.D. 100 corridor might hold 13 employment centers by 2035. Planners calculated that 1,025 people work in the area, which could grow to 21,680 employees in 25 years.\""That will mirror what we've found along interstate interchanges,"" said Mike Cooper, the city's director of planning and building services. ""Once we complete those, they become major magnets for development.""\Under a 2005 agreement with the city, the state agreed to construct S.D. 100 in exchange for the city assuming maintenance of Minnesota Avenue and 10th, 11th and 12th streets.\The agreement doesn't set a completion deadline for S.D. 100; it depends on funding.\""For the last few years, because of funding reasons, we've been focused very strongly on trying to preserve the condition of existing roads, and our ability to add to our system for development purposes has been rather restrictive,"" said Darin Bergquist, secretary of the South Dakota Department of Transportation.\The next segment of S.D. 100 is planned for 2012 and would improve the existing Highway 11 south to 69th Street. But no additional construction in the area is included in the state's five-year plan.\""I'm under the impression development has slowed down a little right now,"" Bergquist said. ""Many of the developers want to see South Dakota 100 in place when the economy turns around so they're ready to move down there. Unfortunately, our ability to have it in place in that short time frame probably isn't very realistic.""\Developers and business advocates are banding together to lobby for the project.\Their first goal is a connection to I-90, which they say will draw out-of-state traffic.\""The idea of a northeast gateway to the city is the biggest game-changer at the moment,"" said Joel Dykstra, who represents a group of area property owners that includes Rob Broin. The investors own 192 acres on both sides of S.D. 100 between Madison Street and I-90.\""If you could wave a wand, this is where you want to open the city,"" Dykstra said. ""It fundamentally shifts traffic.""\Along S.D. 100 between Arrowhead Parkway and Madison Street, C-Lemme Co. is developing a combination of homes, apartments, retail and office space. Foss Fields involves 320 undeveloped acres, but without a connection to I-90 it also might struggle to develop.\""We need to prove the benefits,"" said Joel Ingle of C-Lemme.\Ingle and Dykstra are hoping to work with other area landowners and local officials to advocate for the road project at the state and federal levels.\One proponent is the Sioux Falls Area Chamber of Commerce, which joined with city officials earlier this year to meet with state officials about the project.\""As the city continues to grow, you have to grow business with it,"" said Bob O'Connell, the chamber's director of public affairs and communications. ""This is a perfect plan to promote growth in a way that's logical and progressive.""\Proposed interchange\Another major transportation project involves improving access and traffic flow along I-29 in southwest Sioux Falls.\The city and state began studying the area in 2004 and looked at various alternatives for crossings involving 69th and 85th streets. The result was a series of planned improvements culminating in an interchange at 85th Street.\""It's critical because it will provide an additional route for people that have to use 57th and Louise,"" Cotter said. ""We've maximized the use of that intersection, and we need to provide additional routes to move traffic and reduce driver delay.""\A major project this year will be an initial step toward justifying the interchange. The state and city will build an I-229 overpass and extend Solberg Avenue from 59th to 69th streets. A separate project also will construct the nearby intersection of 69th and Tallgrass Avenue.\The state plans to reconstruct the junction of interstates 29 and 229 in 2013.\""That's going to completely redo the intersection, add additional lanes and raise I-29 near 85th Street so we have it in a way that we can in the future accommodate 85th Street crossing the interstate,"" Bergquist said.\Before an interchange can move forward, federal officials must agree it is justified at the proposed location. The city plans to spend the next six months finishing documentation before submitting it to the Federal Highway Administration.\""We have to show the timing of when we will build out the local network of streets to complement it with an interchange,"" Cotter said. ""It's a new federal requirement because they want to make sure that you tie the local network in with the timing of the interchange.""\Without an interchange, additional development in the area likely will stall. Sanford Health, which owns 185 acres nearby, proposed a research park for the land several years ago.\""As that infrastructure development becomes more clear, we'll assess how that fits into our development plans,"" said Kurt Brost, Sanford's director of real estates services. ""We see it as a very valuable property for our future needs, but exact details will come into play as we know more about what others are doing.""\Brost said it's too soon to say whether the land would still be used for research purposes. Since proposing the research park, Sanford bought the former Hutchinson Technology Inc. manufacturing building in the northeast corner of Sioux Falls and converted it to a corporate headquarters and research center.\""I don't think that precludes what we will do (in the southwest), but that will definitely be part of the discussion now where it wasn't before,"" Brost said.\Lloyd Cos. also owns an adjacent 50 acres and envisions an upscale retail development.\""There's a definite desire for companies to have interstate exposure,"" Lloyd said.\The company gets calls about its land every few months, he said.\""The problem is they say we still have gravel roads up there and people don't want to put up a $10 (million) to $15 million building and have a gravel road"" leading to it, Lloyd said.\Without an interchange, he said, the area could be limited to apartments or offices.\""With an interchange it becomes hotels, restaurants, retail, office area,"" Lloyd said. ""If you throw the research park in, the elevation becomes really big. We probably have six or seven retailers that would like to come to Sioux Falls, but they want to be exposed to I-29. So they're waiting.""\Funding struggles\Like S.D. 100, the 85th Street interchange depends on federal and state funding.\A complete S.D. 100 is estimated to cost $200 million. An interchange at 85th, along with other necessary street improvements comes in at an estimated $96 million.\Tackling either one means battling a budget environment of shrinking revenues, a federal moratorium on congressional earmarks and the state's need to maintain the current system.\Two-thirds of the state Department of Transportation's budget comes from federal funds. The revenue received is based on a formula that currently returns two dollars to the state for every one dollar South Dakota taxpayers send to the federal government.\The formula is determined through federal legislation. It was included in the most recent five-year transportation authorization bill in 2005 and it's up for discussion this year as Congress seeks to reauthorize funding.\""We've battled that every time,"" said U.S. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D. ""We band together and put together a good regional coalition, and we've been very fortunate.""\Larger states, however, also are getting more united in their advocacy for a different formula, he said.\""We'll put together our group and do the best we can in advocating for a strong formula that recognizes a transportation system has to be a national system,"" Thune said. ""Even though we don't have the same population, if you can't get from New York to Seattle, moving freight across the country, you won't have competitive economics.""\Compounding the funding challenge is a federal highway trust fund that has required a supplement from the federal general fund since the recession hit in full force in 2008. There's little appetite in Washington, D.C., to continue that practice, officials said.\""It's very scary to us right now,"" Bergquist said. ""If they develop a program around the existing revenues, the size of the program will go down 25 percent.""\Past transportation authorizations also have included funding for projects added by members of Congress. In 2005, the bill included funding to relocate railroad tracks in downtown Sioux Falls. But a two-year moratorium on earmarks might mean no such projects will be included in the next bill.\The federal transportation bill has expired, and the state's funding is being delivered through continuing resolutions, which Bergquist said makes long-term planning difficult. Unless a new authorization is approved this fall, he said the bill likely would be postponed until 2013.\""Then our intent would be to sit down with the city to make longer-term plans,"" he said.\The rest of the state DOT's revenue primarily comes from the state gas tax and vehicle excise tax. This year, legislators increased the vehicle licensing fee, providing an additional $2.8 million for Minnehaha and Lincoln counties and their respective cities.\That funding likely will be directed toward maintenance needs, along with the majority of the state's transportation budget. Philosophically, the state believes well-maintained roads cost less long-term and has prioritized maintenance over expansion, Bergquist said.\Without expansion, Sioux Falls' traffic projections show extreme congestion possibilities by 2035.\In 2008, Sioux Falls drivers collectively experienced 25,000 hours in delays every day, according to the city. By 2035, even with planned improvements, that number will grow to 74,000 hours based on population growth. Without improvements, the number skyrockets to 387,000 daily delay hours.\Link\A look at the city's long-range transporation plan: Direction 2035\Link\Map of Sioux Falls 2011 infrastructure projects\ID_Code: DF-110405052"
40,"Sluggish economy prompts belt-tightening\PIERRE - Gov. Mike Rounds cited a sluggish economy Tuesday as he outlined a $3.55 billion budget that includes 2.5 percent inflation bumps for schools, state salaries and payments to those who run nursing homes and other people programs.\""We are not expecting a recession,"" Rounds said. But he said total state revenue - including money from the federal government and other sources - is forecast to grow 3.8 percent next year, compared with this year's 6.4 percent.\Rounds blamed some of the slowdown on high oil prices and the national subprime mortgage market and said he needs $28.2 million from budget reserves just to make the books balance in the current year.\Some think the governor's proposal is too tight with state money.\House Democratic leader Dale Hargens of Miller said he would push for a 3 percent increase for those areas Rounds targeted with 2.5 percent.\""The 2.5 isn't going to go over well,"" he said. ""We can find the money.""\Rep. Tim Rave, R-Baltic said, ""It wouldn't surprise me if the Legislature added some to education.""\Half of every tax dollar goes to education at some level. Another 33 cents goes to social and health programs, with 11 cents for corrections, courts and law enforcement. The rest of state government gets 6 cents.\The Legislature will consider Rounds' spending plans during the 2008 session that opens Jan. 8.\State budget questions and answers\PIERRE - There are a whole lot of details in a $3.55 billion budget such as the one Gov. Mike Rounds unveiled for legislators Tuesday.\Numbers and percentages fly around the room, and decimal points pop out from every corner. Appropriations Committee members and executive branch fiscal analysts listen attentively. The folks back home scratch their heads and wish they'd cut fewer classes during Econ 101.\As House Speaker Tom Deadrick points out, it's just the starting point. ""Now we start the discussion and the debate,"" the Platte Republican said. ""We get this overview, but ... we don't know the details yet.""\Here's a quick look at what some of the numbers mean.\Question: Exactly what went on at the Capitol on Tuesday?\Answer: The governor showed legislators how much money he thinks the state will collect in the 12-month fiscal year that starts July 1. Then he explained how he thinks the money should be spent.\Q: What happens next?\A: When the 2008 Legislature opens Jan. 8, lawmakers will look at the governor's recommendations and vote on a final budget. They seldom make major changes in a governor's proposals, but they will have the advantage of another three months of revenue collections to see how much money they have.\Q: Why should I care?\A: Because the budget directs all of the programs and operations of state government, from state aid to schools and foster care programs to highway safety and support for the State Fair. It pays the salaries of state workers, keeps the prisons running and the state inspectors checking for food safety and environmental programs.\And, more personally, the $1.2-plus billion that Rounds says the state will collect in general funds revenue comes from the taxes and fees residents pay when they buy things, hire a contractor or play video lottery. In a state of about 750,000 people, that general fund is the equivalent of $1,610 a person. Some of the money they're spending is yours.\Q: What did the governor propose?\A: A total budget of $3.55 billion. That includes state taxes, federal money and money from the gas tax and other sources. He also said state revenue is coming in more slowly than it did last year. The treasury is growing, but not as quickly as it has in the past three or four years. Rounds wants to spend $28.2 million from budget reserves this year and $4.6 million more next year to keep the books balanced.\Q: Where does that reserve money come from?\A: The state has two basic budget reserves. Right now, they have almost $133 million. Even if legislators agree with the governor, the savings accounts will have less than $100 million at the end of next year. Of course, if there were no reserves, some of the proposed spending changes might not be possible. If things got bad enough, some programs might have to be cut, and nobody is popular when they're cutting programs.\Q: Is the state in trouble?\A: Probably not serious trouble at the moment. It's more a cautionary thing, depending on how the economy goes in coming months. Rounds said some of the economic slowdown could be because of subprime mortgage problems at the national level. Some might be because higher gas prices mean people have less money to spend on other items. And some might be the ongoing effects of drought. A number of people anticipate a better economy for the state in coming months.\Rep. Dale Hargens, D-Miller, says with good crop prices and yields, farmers and ranchers will be buying machinery and other supplies they might have been hesitating to get. Rep. Jim Putnam, R-Armour, who has been on the Appropriations Committee for years, also says next quarter's numbers will show lawmakers what they can spend.\Q: What's the big news from the day?\A: Probably the 2.5 percent raise the governor proposed for state aid and for state workers' salaries and for what they call ""provider inflation."" That's a catch-phrase referring to a host of people programs including nursing homes, assisted-living centers and other places where people take care of other people.\Q: What's the big deal about that?\A: For one thing, Rounds has been a huge advocate of a consistent 3 percent across-the-board salary policy for state workers. ""It had to have hurt for him to recommend 2.5 percent,"" Rep. Tim Rave, R-Baltic, says.\Besides, while state law says schools get the lesser of inflation or 3 percent, for the past couple of years, they've gotten 3 percent. For them, it's a step back. Parkston School Superintendent Shayne McIntosh says he wants state workers to get paid properly. But, he adds, ""We would say the state employees are getting more than a 2.5 percent increase. On top of the 2.5 percent for salary, the health insurance is being covered by the state, as well as all increases to South Dakota retirement and other withholdings. For schools, our 2.5 percent has to cover all of those things, plus things like increased fuel costs.""\Q: Why did the governor lump them all together?\A: That makes sense in a time of giving less than people might have expected. If all those different interests get 2.5 percent increases, an argument can be made that they received equal treatment. McIntosh, of course, makes the other side of that argument. And Hargens, the House Democratic leader, says with an additional $4.8 million, the Legislature could raise each of the areas - schools, state workers and providers - to 3 percent.\Q: Can schools get more money than Rounds proposed?\A: It's certainly possible. Even House Republican leader Larry Rhoden of Union Center noted after the governor's address that the Legislature has, in the past, sometimes bumped state aid above the proposed level. Rounds says he's gone beyond what the law would require. The per-student base with his 2.5 percent proposal would be $4,642. In 2003, it was $3,889. The difference is $753, Rounds said. Raising the level only for inflation over the years would have been a $586 boost, he said.\Q: The Board of Regents has been in the news a lot, asking for money for science and laboratories and wireless campuses. How'd the governor treat them?\A: Pretty well, actually, although perhaps not as well as they'd hoped. The regents outlined a $117 million lab and science center upgrade this fall. They wanted $75 million in state bonds, with the Legislature repaying the debt at $5 million a year for 25 years.\Rounds wants to commit $2.3 million in state money and wants the regents to do the same. He says that would be enough to repay a $65 million bond issue. There will be considerable discussion about that whole package during the session. Some legislators say the state simply isn't a research place. Others say South Dakota can't afford not to compete in science and research.\Q: And wireless campuses? What's that about?\A: Higher education people say a lot of kids coming to the campuses are from high schools where wireless laptops and networks are the norm. The universities say they have to ramp up to provide the same environment if they are to compete for students and then give them the kind of education a knowledge-based economy requires. The governor wants to plunk $1.3 million toward the wireless initiative.\Q: What did the governor do about teacher salaries?\A: Last year he proposed, and the Legislature adopted, a $4 million program called TCAP, which is aimed at targeting pay raises to teachers for doing things that move a district toward specific goals in education. He's recommending the same thing this year. A lot of districts griped about it, calling it one-time money they couldn't count on in future years. At the same time, several superintendents who got into the program said their financial straits were so dire they'd take any money they could get from the state, even if it were no replacement for general increases in state aid.\Q: Give some examples of special programs the governor recommended.\A: He proposed $250,000 to buy easements to private property near Bear Butte. Rounds says some landowners are willing to negotiate, and he said easements would ease concerns about commercial development of areas near the western South Dakota mountain. He also proposed $2.9 million to continue a program started three years ago to provide laptop computers for high school students.\Q: The governor also proposed money for the Lewis & Clark pipeline, didn't he?\A: Yes. He said $1 million from the state could match $5.4 million in other money. The total $6.4 million would be the first of three years of what Rounds called a way to ""upfront pay our share of the total project cost. The Lewis & Clark Rural Water System is critical for the future development of southeastern South Dakota. The project needs to move forward."" He said legislative funding would boost the chances of getting the rest of the federal money needed for the project.\@ARGUS LEADER.COM\Log on to view the governor's slide presentation about the state budget.\NUMBERS TELL STORY\Here are some key figures from Gov.

43,"South Dakota voters are looking at one of the most complicated ballots in state history this election cycle.\There are 10 ballot questions alongside choices for U.S. President, U.S. Senate and House of Representatives and local state legislators. Television and radio ads are in heavy rotation, mailboxes are stuffed with electoral paraphernalia, boulevards and front yards are littered with campaign signs and social media feeds are full of ads and opinions.\With all the political noise, you'd be forgiven for missing the race for Public Utilities Commission between Republican Chris Nelson and Democrat Henry Red Cloud.\PUC elections typically garner less attention than more overtly political races, but a PUC office holder's decisions often have a more direct effect on taxpayers.\It is the PUC, after all, that regulates the price of your electricity, the quality of your telephone and broadband service, and the placement of pipelines and other major energy projects.\The contrast between 2016's PUC candidates is stark, both in terms of the candidates' backgrounds and their vision for the state's infrastructure. One is a longtime public servant and member of South Dakota's Republican establishment; the other a political novice who runs a renewable energy business.\The incumbent is Nelson, current chairman of the PUC and former Secretary of State who ran unsuccessfully in 2010 for the U.S. House seat currently held by Rep. Kristi Noem.\Nelson sees himself as an impartial judge of energy infrastructure projects and proposed energy rate hikes and a champion for extending broadband access to underserved rural populations.\Nelson has declined to take a position on future pipelines, power plants or wind energy projects and says doing so would taint his ability to act as a judge of the facts.\Were he to show his hand before a hearing, Nelson said, he'd almost certainly be asked to recuse himself by a permit applicant.\State law expects impartiality from commissioners as they weigh electric rates and energy projects, Nelson said.\""People ask me 'are you pro-pipeline or anti-pipeline?' That question is irrelevant,"" Nelson said. ""We serve in a judicial capacity.""\If elected, Nelson's major policy goal would be to bridge what he calls the ""rural-rural"" divide in broadband.\In some areas of the state, high-speed Internet access might exist on one side of a gravel road but not the other.\""As long as (the divide) exists, we've got to continue to work on solving it,"" Nelson said.\With students expected to have Internet access for class and agriculture increasingly reliant on broadband, Nelson said the state must push providers to use federal grant dollars to expand.\Red Cloud, who's never run for public office, says the state needs new blood and new ideas on energy. His focus would be on small-scale renewable energy projects like rooftop solar and wind turbines.\""My goal is to look to South Dakota as being a leader in renewable energy,"" Red Cloud said. ""We have tremendous sunshine as well as wind. We should be the leader, but we're behind. Every farmer and rancher, every home ought to have residential renewables.""\The Pine Ridge Democrat has been critical of Nelson's vote to approve the Dakota Access pipeline and has said he feels Nelson isn't working with the interests of regular citizens in mind.\Red Cloud is a direct descendant of Fort Laramie Treaty signatory and legendary Lakota warrior Chief Red Cloud, and he's positioned himself during the campaign as someone who would fight for the environment when making decisions on energy.\""I ask them 'where do you stand on pipelines?' It doesn't take but a second for them to say they don't like them,"" Red Cloud said.\The candidate owns a solar energy manufacturing business that doubles as a green energy training center for Native American tribes across the U.S. He says South Dakota suffers because of a lack of a policy on net metering, which allows customers with solar panels or small turbines to sell unused power back to utilities.\""Megawatts are good, but outside companies come in, do the install and then they're gone, stimulating the economy elsewhere,"" Red Cloud said.\John Hult is the Reader's Watchdog reporter for Argus Leader Media.
