BUILD REST OF THE STATE
\
At last, the Nebraska School Activities Association is spreading the wealth and distributing the state tournaments to many different towns.
\
Lincoln should be grateful it will host five of those events instead of whining and saying we must build an expensive new arena!
\
It seems the town leaders are beginning to possess the same greed mentality as the CEOs of our country.
\
If you look at most other states, they have lots of midsized communities rather than two large cities. We need to expand our populations, businesses and events to help the rest of the state develop instead of shrink.
\
This decision, along with the move of the State Fair, should begin building the rest of the

\
WHAT A SCAM
\
What a scam. President Barack Obama sends Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner in to nationalize the banking system, which may be expanded to his having sole authority over seizing any financial institution.
\
What a scam. Obama exceeds his Constitutional authority and fires the chief executive of General Motors as an opening move in nationalizing the automotive industry. Then he appoints a former labor union hack to the task force to evaluate and pass judgment on the GM and Chrysler reorganization proposals.
\
What a scam. As the auto nationalization moves forward, indicators are that newspapers in financial distress will be next. By converting them to a nonprofit status with tax breaks, those that survive could be limited to what Obama wants printed. Conservative views could be eliminated. After the newspapers have been converted, AM radio could be next, with the elimination of all talk radio. Finally, television could see the end of the Fox News channel.
\
What a scam. This is not the change we could believe in. It is insanity. It could harken the day of controlled news not seen since Nazi Germany. It also is corporate fascism and is coming rapidly in the health and energy sectors of our economy as soon as the administration can muscle it into law with a packed Congress greedily ready to comply with Obama's wishes. Not the America I grew up in, defended and have loved all my life.

DO THE JOB, JOHANNS
\
Sometimes those rascals in Washington, D. C. , tell the truth in spite of themselves.
\
Mike Johanns'""Signature moment"" (LJS, April 3) was not his collaborating with Sen. Robert Byrd in blocking President Barack Obama's cap and trade system from passing as part of the budget, but rather his thanking Sen. Byrd for ""... protecting the Senate .... ""
\
He is obviously more concerned with preserving 100 people's jobs than he is with protecting the environment for the remaining 6, 700, 000, 000 of us.
\
He then slithers under another hypocritical rock and hisses that Obama's cap and trade mandate ""... really changes the economics of the nation. ""
\
Really? Does he mean like the Bush-Cheney policies (of which he was a part) changed the economics of the nation? Johanns must have attended and graduated magna cum laude from the George W. Bush School of Obliviousness.
\
Johanns' ego-stroking pontifications and myopic thinking belong in the Comic section.
\
He needs to spend more time doing his job rather than just trying to keep it!

It's a reminder.
\
In a world of declining news media responsibility, when the focus is more on entertainment than information, and the content is increasingly trivial and squishy-soft or loaded with political bias, Egypt is a reminder that there's a place for real news coverage.
\
And a need.
\
And there still are a few places -- unfortunately, few is the right word -- where we still can go to read and see and listen and learn and understand.
\
A few media outlets still devote resources and personnel and commitment to that task, at great expense in a highly competitive media world that has drifted into chatter.
\
We will lose if the serious, informed, objective voices are swept away in this transformation from news to entertainment.
\
Given the choice of three presidential electoral vote allocation alternatives, most of the 977 Nebraska voters surveyed by telephone last week favored awarding those votes to the winner of the national popular vote.
\
Here's the breakdown from an automated telephone poll conducted Jan. 26-27 by Public Policy Polling for the National Popular Vote movement:
\
- 57 percent favored the national popular vote winner. That is, whoever wins the most votes is elected president.
\
- 27 percent supported allocation of electoral votes by congressional district. Nebraska now allocates an electoral vote to the presidential winner in each of its three congressional districts and two electoral votes to the winner of the statewide vote.
\
- 16 percent favored a winner-take-all system of awarding all electoral votes to the statewide winner. The Legislature is considering a proposal, supported by the Nebraska Republican Party, to restore a winner-takeall system in the state.
\
In a separate question asking voters simply to choose between electing the candidate who gets the most votes nationwide or by the current method of allocating electoral votes by states, 67 percent favored the national popular vote.
\
The National Popular Vote movement is supporting a bill in the Legislature that would award the state's five electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote if and when Nebraska is joined in a compact to do so by states possessing a majority of the nation's electoral votes.

Bill Dobler: gentleman and gentle man.

Family man, man of faith, principled, decent, nice guy. After 84 years, that's pretty darn good.
\
Dobler, editor of The Lincoln Star, the city's morning newspaper before the Journal Star went hybrid, died in Lincoln last week.
\
Finishing up
\
- Sitting in the pile of this year's pending legislative bills is a measure introduced by Mark Christensen designed to require presidential candidates -- uh, that would be Barack Obama -- to jump through a series of ""birther"" hoops to get his or her name on the ballot in Nebraska. Must be born in the USA and subject exclusively to the jurisdiction of the United States; both parents U.S. citizens; multiple documents and records required.
\
- Sen. Mike Johanns disputes a report by the U.S. Office of Special Counsel that says he, among others in the Bush administration, ran afoul of the prohibition against use of taxpayer funds for partisan political purposes when he traveled to a number of events as U.S. secretary of agriculture in 2006. Johanns says records will demonstrate that the costs for his participation in any political events were fully reimbursed.
\
- Johanns has a new Senate committee assignment: Environment and Public Works. With an eye on EPA's plans to regulate carbon emissions, Johanns says: ""I'll work to rein in the Environmental Protection Agency's effort to implement backdoor cap and trade.""
\
- Sen. Ben Nelson says he ""hope(s) we do nothing"" to tighten gun control during this session of Congress. ""If laws were complied with,"" he says, ""we wouldn't have speeding.""
\
- The New York Times last week editorially commended Jim Suttle and Omaha's anti-recall voters. The mayor, The Times said, ""declined the familiar politician-as-panderer's escape route (of) draconian vows to slash services while worshipping at the 'no-newtaxes' shrine"" and raised taxes to efficiently address the city's budget deficit.
\
- If 2011 MLB magazines are on the newsstands, it must be almost February. The Sporting News mag foresees a Phillies-Red Sox World Series. Easy pick; wholly predictable; half right.
\
- Hope the feds won't be measuring workplace productivity in Nebraska on Wednesday. It's who's-a-Husker day.
\
- Pitchers and catchers in two weeks.

Stunning.
\
Expenditures for health care reform TV ads in Nebraska stand at an estimated $8 million.
\
And that doesn't even count all those ads trying to sell us prescription drugs that, they mention by the way, might have side effects such as death and total destruction of your health.
\
TV outlets owe Sen.Ben Nelson.His is the only Nebraska vote that's ever been in play.
\
Most of those ads helped fuel anger and fear about health care reform legislation and played a big role in creating the environment that drove down Nelson's approval numbers in Nebraska after he voted for the bill.
\
No doubt, Nelson has taken a political hit.
\
No doubt, he's never been under such attack.
\
But the latest figures measuring Nelson's political health in Nebraska can be read two ways.
\
Nelson's job approval rating plunged to 42 percent in a telephone survey of 500 registered voters published in Sunday's Omaha World-Herald.
\
His disapproval number stood at 48 percent.
\
If you're Ben Nelson, that's not good.
\
On the other hand, you could argue that: 1) this may measure the bottom moment created by the health care vote; 2) a 42 percent base to start from may not be too bad, considering the intensely negative environment at the moment; and 3) it's almost three years until re-election day.
\
Those TV ads soon will go off the air. Health care reform fears stoked by opponents may not materialize in coming months and years. The subject will change. Nelson will be out front opposing the Obama administration's cap-and-trade proposals in coming weeks. New issues, new concerns, new Senate votes will dominate the rest of the year. And 2011. And 2012. This could go either way. And,of course,it's possible Nelson won't seek re-election. He'll be 71 in 2012. And he's never been treated this way before. Maybe he'll just decide enough is enough. Once again, it's way too early to tell.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has tagged Nebraska's 2nd District as one of its top 17 House races this year. State Sen. Tom White is challenging Republican Rep.

\
Former Nelson aide David DiMartino peppered South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster with questions at the National Press Club last week.
\
McMaster, a candidate for governor, has made a big issue out of the Nebraska Medicaid exemption that originally was inserted in the Senate's revised health care reform bill.
\
The provision represented a ""Cornhusker Kickback"" designed to win Nelson's support for the bill, McMaster said.
\
DiMartino asked Mc-Master if he accepted ""Carolina Kickbacks"" when he received campaign contributions from a Columbia lawyer after hiring that firm to represent the state in a lawsuit.
\
A Wall Street Journal editorial criticized McMaster for that action, DiMartino reminded him.
\
""That's a pesky question,"" McMaster said.
\
DiMartino now is a Democratic consultant who is CEO at Blue Line Strategic Communications in Washington.
\

\
Finishing up:
\
- In case you missed it, the job approval rating for Mike Johanns in the OWH poll stood at a sturdy 63 percent.
\
- Nelson says the health care reform bill includes a provision authorizing a study of Nebraska's tough tort law to see how it holds down medical malpractice lawsuits, with an eye toward determining how it could apply nationally.
\
- E-mail from a reader responding to an earlier column about health care reform: ""When a thief is in your house with a gun to your head demanding your stuff and threatening to destroy the results of a lifetime of effort, you don't 'settle down.' You get outraged and try to defend your family.""
\
- A game-changer in Massachusetts on Tuesday? It'll be election night on cable TV once again. Get out the map.
\
- Dr. Amanda McKinney, the Nebraska obstetrician/gynecologist who thanks Nelson for his health care reform vote in a new TV ad, is the granddaughter of Clair Callan, the former Nebraska congressman who voted to enact Medicare in 1965.

PROGRAM WILL BRING LESS
\
So the Democratic Party chairman thinks Nebraskans should like the cap-and-trade legislation being shoved down our throats because it might bring some money into the state (""GOP takes issue with 'rural tour,'"" July 4). Fat chance, and if it does it will probably be much, much less than what the whole program will cost in new taxes that will have to be paid out.
\
Actually, that's what the whole program is all about -- that and government control over everything you can do. Not only will there be more taxes paid out, but there also will be much, much higher costs for everything you need for living -- including food, water and everything else -- and there will be endless government interference in even what kind of light bulbs you can have and how much electricity you can use without paying extra penalties.
\
So if this is such a good program, be prepared to suffer greatly for nothing but government control. If that's good, I'll eat my hat.
\
Besides, Vic Covalt's idea that money makes it all right is what we need to get away from, because it's our money in the first place before the Democrats get ahold of it.

\
GET TIERRA PARK FIXED
\
I would love to know the mindset of the watershed agency concerning Tierra Park.
\
We now have two large drainage areas with trash-filled grates leading out of them.
\
If you chase a Frisbee now, you'll fall in a hole. In addition to the loss of open park space, the concrete runoffs have been removed where we now have stagnant water (mosquito hatcheries). We don't get the kind of rains to accomplish what I think these drainage areas were structured for.
\
I hope the city gets the dirt back in those empty holes and replaces the runoffs with concrete.
\
Jan Simodynes, Lincoln
\
ALTERNATIVE FOR FIREWORKS
\
The huge sales are over, the bombs are done bursting in air, and the flag is still there. Our typical celebration of July 4 winds down, yet do we stop to put this into perspective? According to one source, U.S. citizens spend $1 billion each year to buy mostly Chinese-imported fireworks.
\
Is there any wonder that our balance of payments is in the red with the purchase of these nonessential explosives, made by people who earn less than $2 per day in difficult working conditions? The residues left in the streets of Lincoln are washed into storm sewers and then to Salt Creek, where they pollute these already questionable waters. Eleven people died in 2006, and close to 10,000 were injured in the United States because of fireworks. These unintended consequences of our annual celebrations are not recognized by most, as we gaze into the sky with wonder at each new blast, unless an injured child happens to be our own. So it would seem to be a lose-lose-lose situation, only for a few moments of pleasure.
\
For some people, this is a tradition that adds quality to life. For me this is a dangerous habit that is costly to each of us and to our country, and an unnecessary expense especially for those without work or living close to the edge financially. Making and blowing up fireworks is also unhealthy to the environment and is a grievous waste of resources we will need in the future.
\
Can we devise something more meaningful, less dangerous and less costly that will have more lasting impact in improving the human condition? We owe this to our children, while we celebrate the fact that most emerged without injury this year in Lincoln.

SUPPORT FREE CHOICE
\
Barry L. Kennedy's opposition to the Employee Free Choice Act (""For sake of state, oppose bill,"" Local View, Feb. 23) fails on all fronts. The Free Choice Act would apply to the whole nation, not just Nebraska.
\
Currently, an employer can recognize a union just from the authorization cards alone, without a vote. Kennedy's statement that businesses would only have 90 days to accept the union contract before arbitration works both ways. If the union failed to accept contract terms within 90 days, they would also be ""forced to deal with an arbitrator.""
\
He also states, ""the current process is fair for all involved."" Soliciting cards under the Free Choice Act would be identical to the current process. Union organizers already know if you sign a card because the National Labor Relations Board doesn't accept authorization cards directly from individuals. Seems it would still be ""fair for all involved.""
\
The most blatant misstatement is that the Free Choice Act eliminates the secret ballot. It does not, but rather allows the employee to ask for it instead of the employer, hence the ""Free Choice"" name.
\
Until 1966, the NLRB operated under the Joy Silk Doctrine, whereby an employer had to recognize a bargaining representative who presented cards signed by a majority of the work force unless the employer had a good faith doubt. The Free Choice Act would effectively reinstate the Joy Silk Doctrine.
\
In addition, Nebraska's rightto-work status wouldn't change with this act. Kennedy is on the wrong side of this issue.

\
NOT COMPARABLE
\
I'm disappointed with the analysis used by the editorial board to justify a decrease in benefits for city workers,""Change city retirement match"" (LJS, Feb. 25). Comparing the average city employee salary to the average fulltime worker in Lincoln is not an apples to apples comparison.
\
I can't imagine Microsoft justifying a reduction of employee benefits because of analysis that shows that the average Microsoft employee makes tens of thousands more then the average Starbucks employee. I appreciate the LJS and especially Deena Winter's coverage of local government, but for me to conclude that city employees are overpaid or that their benefits are too generous, I'll need more information.
\
How about an apples to apples comparison of wages and benefits that compares city workers of similar education and experience to their private-sector counterparts?
\
David Wasson, Lincoln
\
TROUBLED POLICIES
\
My husband owns a dental practice in Lincoln. He and I together have watched anxiously as the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act wended its way through both houses of Congress. Would the needs of small business owners be considered?
\
And when the president formed his economic advisory board, would small business owners be represented?
\
The answer to both questions is no. As a result, I fear small businesses may be ripe for exploitation in the name of economic stimulus. Programs such as the cap-and-trade emissions control system so popular now among U.S. lawmakers could end up costing small businesses more than stimulating their success.
\
Many experts agree that a capand-trade system would be rife with the same type of reckless behavior by Wall Street that has cost us all so much already and ushered in the current recession. While it's certain that action must be taken to regulate carbon emissions, it is critical that we not land ourselves in deeper economic trouble than we're already in by opting for a policy as flawed as cap-and-trade.
\
We all know small business is the backbone of this nation's economy. How about some programs that protect and stimulate small business growth, rather than bending the nation's economic backbone under the weight of costly programs?

\
DISCUSSION IS NEEDED
\
I was dismayed to read the Feb. 12 headline ""County to consider options for manor"" because of the fiscal crisis at Lancaster Manor. Before the county commissioners decide to sell, lease or hire management for the nursing home, the public needs to recognize the total costs involved, including the trust to our community.
\
In 1969, the Lancaster County Board recognized the need for a facility to care for the medically indigent elderly and established Lancaster Manor in 1970. The manor's mission is to provide a nursing home of the highest quality care, keeping residents close to their family and friends and maintaining a trust that the placement is secure and not subject to their financial resources. Our community has supported Lancaster Manor generously with donations to enrich the residents and by building a new facility.
\
Before hasty decisions are made to solve Lancaster Manor's financial status, we need a public discussion as neighbors and taxpayers as to our responsibility to our community's medically needy elders.
\
If current Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement cannot cover operating expenses at this time, what steps will new management take to balance the books? Will residents be charged for every tissue box and toothbrush issued for their care? Will individualized programming and services be cut? How will the quality of care be affected if there are fewer caregivers and support staff? The last issue is particularly relevant because the manor serves a significant number of residents with no or limited family involvement.
\
Lancaster Manor is an asset to our community. It is my hope that the public and county commissioners will responsibly consider these quality-of-life issues as we decide what option is in the best interest of our community.

RIDICULOUS STORY
\
Regarding ""Widow of smoker gets $8 million in damages,"" Feb. 9: The man was a chain smoker for decades.

I would like to know whose fault it was that he smoked. Did someone stand over him with a weapon to force him to smoke and kill himself with the cancer stick? How ridiculous!
\

\
FOCUS ON ACADEMICS
\
The article ""Economy woes could force college aid shift"" (LJS, Feb. 23) was rather frustrating and discouraging. Athletic scholarships were mentioned. The idea that 900 more NCAA scholarships are available for golf and tennis athletes than basketball athletes is upsetting.
\
But what is even more repulsive is the fact that so much money is going into college athletics. In such a hard economic environment, shouldn't our universities be focusing on cultivating the best and the brightest of our students to become the leaders of this nation?
\
Athletics is a form of entertainment. Academics should be more important than developing the next basketball star or winning a national football title. I am a red-blooded Cornhusker who loves football, but when our universities are making budget cuts and preparing to cut faculty who are here for educational purposes, isn't it time we take a look at where cuts should really be made?
\
I am a part of the middle class mentioned in the article. The only way I am attending school is on a merit-based scholarship. It is very upsetting to think that I could lose the academic scholarship I have earned while a C-average basketball or football star continues to attend school free of charge.

HOSPICE CAN HELP
\
Kudos for the wonderful article on hospice (""Number of those admitted to state hospices on steady climb,"" LJS, Feb. 23). It is nice to see the number of hospice admissions on the rise, but there are still so many who could benefit from hospice services.
\
One thing the article did not address was the cost. Most people do not realize that hospice services are covered by Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance companies. Most equipment, supplies and medications are covered under the hospice benefit. This can be a huge financial benefit to patients with any end-stage disease: heart, lung, kidney, Alzheimer's or cancer.
\
Hospice can be a tremendous help to those who are terminally ill as well as their families.

A seat on the Nebraska Public Power District board is a much-sought-after position by people with ties to the public power industry. All three candidates vying for incumbent Mary Harding's seat in Subdivision 2 have extensive experience in the electric utility industry.
\
In Subdivision 9, five candidates are vying for longtime NPPD board member Larry Kuncl's seat. They, too, have extensive utility experience.
\
NPPD, the state's largest electric utility, serves all or parts of 91 of Nebraska's 93 counties. The utility is governed by an 11-member board of directors. Each director serves a six-year term.
\
Subdivisions 2 and 9 are the only contested races in the primary. The top two vote-getters will advance to the general election.
\
Based in Columbus, NPPD delivers power to about 1 million Nebraskans. Two of the largest power plants in the state - Cooper Nuclear Station near Brownville and Gerald Gentleman Station near Sutherland - are part of its diverse energy portfolio.

Regarding the global warming issue, what do you think NPPD should do to try and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions?
\
What is the most important issue facing NPPD today?
\
Do you have a plan to reduce rates for NPPD customers?

SUBDIVISON 2
\
Mary Harding
\
Age: 53
\
Address: 1919 D St., Lincoln
\
Occupation: Executive director, Nebraska League of Conservation Voters
\
Political Party: Democrat
\
Elected in 2003, Harding is seeking a second term on the NPPD Board of Directors.
\
""Costs and constraints of producing electricity are changing dramatically, and it is essential that we invest carefully now for a strong economy, affordable power and a healthy environment for our children and grandchildren,"" she said.
\
Harding's prior civic experience includes 12 years as executive director of the Nebraska Environmental Trust. She also was on the Southeast Community College board in the 1990s and was a legislative lobbyist.
\
NPPD promotes co-generation with our industrial customers, has accelerated efficiency and conservation programs, retrofitted existing plants and monitors emerging technologies continuously. We invest $5 million each year in innovative research at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. We evaluate total costs of production, including emissions and the likelihood of a federal carbon tax. We should increase production of renewable power with all deliberate haste.
\
This is a critical time for NPPD, and our challenges are many: Power plants are aging, our appetite for electricity is growing and many technologies to address climate change are only now being proven at a scale to meet demand. NPPD must have leadership that is engaged and forward-looking, to build on our very successful past under rapidly changing conditions.
\
We must ensure affordable electricity for everyone. Nebraskans enjoy very low rates and low rate growth especially compared to other consumer costs, in part due to investments made 30 years ago. We must show the same vision in planning today to return value to Nebraskans. Our best strategy is vigorous planning for smooth transition to the technologies of this century.
\
Richard Newcomer
\
Age: 54
\
Address: 2823 Laredo Drive, Lincoln
\
Occupation: Community college instructor
\
Political Party: Republican
\
Citing his 34 years of experience working with the public power industry, Newcomer has many contacts among municipal and rural utilities in Nebraska.
\
""I have a unique vantage point compared to most directors in that I have been in the 'trenches' of utility work,"" he said. ""I understand what it takes to deliver power to the customer and what needs to be done to continue to guarantee good service.""
\
A former Lincoln Electric System line technician, Newcomer has been on the executive board of IBEW Local 1536 for several years. He currently is on the academic council for Metropolitan Community College.
\
Carbon dioxide emissions could only be curbed from existing fossil fuel-generating plants at great cost. This would undoubtedly result in increased energy costs for all Nebraskans. I believe continued research into the causes of global warming should be completed before spending millions of dollars, in hope that the effort will decrease warming.
\
Upward pressure on prices for the resources needed to generate and deliver power to the state. Concern over the possibility of legislation requiring generators to reduce greenhouse gasses would only add to that pressure. In order to provide safe, inexpensive energy to the public, costs must be controlled. Legislated additions to those costs will mean higher rates.
\
I think it is somewhat unrealistic to expect rates to be reduced to any great degree. Efficient management of all the resources within NPPD is vital to keeping a lid on rates. I would keep a continual watch on management practices and ask all the right questions of NPPD management in an effort to make good decisions.
\
Sam Peterson
\
Age: 61
\
Address: 2400 Wilderness Ridge Drive, Lincoln
\
Occupation: Engineer/manager
\
Political Party: Republican
\
Although he has no experience in public office, Peterson has 37 years of experience in electric utility operations. He has worked at four separate utilities and two utility consulting firms and is familiar with NPPD and public utility internal procedures and policies.
\
""My primary goal is to make sure that electric rates are as absolutely low as possible for the people of Nebraska in the future, while maintaining a genuine respect for our environment,"" he said.
\
Peterson has belonged to the National Society of Professional Engineers, American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the Project Management Institute.
\
NPPD should emphasize energy conservation with their customers and provide a detailed plan to promote it. They also should have formal plans to improve the efficiency of each of their power generating stations. Renewable energy generation methods should also be pursued to the extent that they are economically feasible.
\
NPPD's most important issue today is the aging of their base load power plants. Their nuclear station is 34 years old, and their two major coal-fired plants do not have the latest environmental controls. Major expenditures must be considered to clean up the coal-fired plants, upgrade the nuclear plant and secure future generation.
\
I cannot promise to reduce rates. However, I would plan to use my voice on the Board of Directors to keep the rates as low as possible. The increasing cost of oil affects coal, railroad transportation, natural gas and nuclear fuel. My plan is to keep rates as stable and low as possible in spite of these outside influences.
\
Glen R. Schmieding
\
Age: 70
\
Address: 7532 Upton Grey Lane, Lincoln
\
Occupation: Retired general manager, Norris Public Power District
\
Political Party: Republican
\
Schmieding was general manager of the Beatrice-based Norris Public Power District from 1974-2004.
\
""I wish to utilize my knowledge of the Nebraska public power systems to serve the electric ratepayers and provide guidance and policy- making skills to the NPPD board,"" he said. ""If elected, I will serve as an advocate for LES and Norris Public Power District to help deliver the benefits of public power.""
\
Schmieding is a past president of the Nebraska Power Association and has degrees in electrical engineering and business administration.
\
NPPD should add to its wind-generation capacity, improve efficiency of fossil electric generating facilities, increase utilization of nuclear generation and offer energy conservation and load management incentives. It should evaluate the potential of hydroelectric pumped storage and coal gasification. If global warming proves to be a real issue, NPPD should be making plans to prepare for greenhouse gas regulation.
\
The major challenge facing NPPD is dealing with the present and future environmental regulations in a responsible and cost effective manner. There are regulations relating to water, air quality, hazardous waste, wildlife etc., which all impact costs and operations. NPPD is studying modification to its Gerald Gentleman station to meet regional haze visibility requirements, which is potentially very costly.
\
NPPD's Integrated Resource Plan projects that the cost of coal, uranium and natural gas will continue to increase, so reducing rates would be very difficult. I would stress measures to mitigate future rate increases including load management, energy conservation, keeping power plants running efficiently, partnering with other utilities, controlling payrolls and general expenses, and maximizing excess power sales.

SUBDIVISION 9
\
Jerry Chlopek
\
Age: 61
\
Address: 3073 39th Ave., Columbus
\
Occupation: Operations director
\
Political Party: Republican
\
Chlopek has 40 years' experience with public power in Nebraska including 25 years as a supervisor.
\
If elected, he would work to stabilize rates, review construction and maintenance procedures to verify that electricity will remain reliable for years to come. He also would work to ensure that NPPD remains a well-run organization.
\
A veteran of the Vietnam War and Desert Storm, Chlopek is a former assistant inspector general with the 89th Army Reserve Command. He also served in a military police battalion.
\
NPPD needs to bring new technology to address CO2 reduction. More renewables, cleaner coal technology and more nuclear plants, conservation and hybrid vehicles. I agree with their long-term strategic plan to have 10 percent of their generation from renewables by 2020. NPPD constantly monitors their plants and they are dedicated to keeping them in compliance with all regulations.
\
Maintaining low-cost rates at 30 percent below the national average. New federal laws that are aimed at reducing CO2 may place unattainable goals on electric utilities before CO2 reduction technology is available. Reports show this could raise electric rates by 50 percent. This would hurt low-income Nebraskans.
\
Review the methods that NPPDuses to purchase fuel for their coal and nuclear plants. Coal prices have doubled over the past seven years, and nuclear fuel has doubled over the last two years. Also, I would look at its equity level and long-term financial plans to confirm that they make good financial sense.

Larry G. Kuncl
\
Age: 69
\
Address: 3354 Pershing Road, Columbus
\
Occupation: Retired electric utility manager and engineer
\
Political Party: Republican
\
Kuncl is seeking a third term on the NPPDBoard of Directors.
\
A professional engineer with nuclear power experience, he was chairman of the NPPD board in 2007 and vice chairman for five or six years.
\
""Because of my technical background, I am able to serve as a 'bridge' between the board and staff,"" Kuncl said. ""My nuclear experience is a key to understanding Cooper Nuclear Station.""
\
Kuncl says he wants to continue on the board because NPPD probably will build a baseload power plant in the future ""and I want to be part of that decision.""
\
In the near term, we need to upgrade plant efficiency to get the maximum amount of electrical power. For the long term, we must continue installing wind turbines. I have been a major force in causing NPPD to invest in wind farms.
\
The most important issue is maintaining low electrical power costs in a time of rising fuel costs and increasing global warming regulations. Plant retrofits at NPPD coal plants will probably cost twice the original plant cost. Selecting the correct power plant choice for the next plant will be crucial.
\
NPPD rates are 30 percent less than the average of other utilities in the United States. It is not realistic to say that rates will be reduced. It is important that the correct choices be made in a rapidly changing regulatory and economic world so that NPPDrates can continue to be low.

Address: 2077 120th St., Petersburg
\
Occupation: retired from economic development position
\
Political Party: not listed
\
Petsche was the economic development director in Boone County. She also has worked as an office manager for an independent utility company.
\
""As an economic developer, I experienced a positive partnership with the utilities who serve our communities,"" Petsche said. ""This relationship sparked an interest particularly in wind generation.""
\
Petsche would like to participate in making decisions to meet the significant challenges facing the power industry. She said she was ""looking forward to broadening my knowledge and bringing to the table a different perspective from outside the power industry.""
\
Technology will determine if carbon, CO2 and other emissions can be captured. Legislation will dictate the timeline for compliance. A diversified portfolio that includes more renewables will offset coal-fire generation. I would encourage customer education for conservation in the use of electricity. We all need to ensure that everything is done to protect our resources for future generations.
\
I believe there are three: A. Carbon and CO2 issues; B. Water limitations; C. Harvesting the wind crop.
\
I cannot promise to reduce rates for NPPD customers. I value the importance public power plays in our present and future.

Don Schaufelberger
\
Age: 82
\
Address: 123 N. Parkway, Columbus
\
Occupation: Retired/consultant
\
Political Party: Republican
\
A retired president and CEO of NPPD, Schaufelberger has continued to work as a utility consultant.
\
""I want to continue as a contributor to the growth and success of NPPD and public power in Nebraska,"" he said. ""I can best accomplish this by blending my engineering knowledge with the knowledge of other disciplines brought by other board members for the best overall results in carrying out the board's responsibilities.""
\
Schaufelberger has a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. He is co-writing a new book on the history of public power in Nebraska.
\
Continue and expand programs to encourage electric customer energy conservation. Expand use of generation, which does not produce greenhouse gas emissions. Extend the operating license of Cooper Nuclear Station.
\
How to mitigate the impact of the continuing escalation of the cost of fuel and freight and the high cost of meeting and mitigating the increasing and more stringent environmental legislation and rules.
\
There are forces outside the control of NPPD that will continue to drive the rates of all utilities upward; therefore, it would be my plan to help recognize these forces as far in advance as possible to plan strategies for coping with such forces to have minimal impact on rates for NPPD customers.
\
Robert E. White
\
Age: 70
\
Address: 2010 17th St., Columbus
\
Occupation: Retired
\
Political Party: Republican
\
White has 33 years with the Loup River PublicPower District, 19 of those as president and CEO.
\
""With 44 years in the electric industry 33 in Nebraska I would like to use that experience to help continue public power's service to Nebraska,"" he said. ""I would like to be involved in the transition to a renewable fuel and more energy-efficient future.""
\
A professional engineer, White was co-chair of the Columbus Economic Council from 1987-2006 and is a past chair of the Columbus Area Chamber of Commerce.
\
NPPD should continue to add renewable energy resources to NPPD's generation mix. NPPD should also increase its efforts in promoting energy efficiency by providing incentives to customers to purchase efficient equipment. The use of renewable energy and reduced energy consumption will reduce NPPD's use of fossil fuels. These changes must be done to maintain NPPD as a low cost utility.
\
NPPD is experiencing considerable system load growth because of the ethanol industry, compressor station construction, industrial load growth and growth in agriculture. This requires major investments to maintain NPPD's reliable electric system. Global climate change policy decisions by the federal government could have a significant impact on NPPD's generation costs since NPPD has major generation resources that use fossil fuels.
\
If NPPD makes the correct decisions on the infrastructure required to provide reliable service, rate increases will be minimized. In the past, NPPD has used off-system energy sales to minimize its customers' costs. The potential exists for NPPD to use Nebraska's significant wind energy to create revenue for NPPD.

RECONSIDER UNL HOCKEY
\
I hope Tom Osborne didn't dismiss the idea too quickly to join six Big Ten teams in a new hockey conference being formed (""Osborne: No plans for hockey,"" March 23). If UNL wants to join later, there may be more of a cost if the conference is successful. Many of these same six teams have operated hockey teams successfully for years.
\
I know there are Title IX considerations, but it is a tremendous opportunity to add a sport that should attract average attendance of a few thousand fans per game. Isn't that the idea of college athletics -- to not only have great student participation, but also to have a sport that draws strong university and community support?
\
Another large consideration is the financial aspect, which good average attendance would help. Also, well-attended university sporting events draw extra traffic to Lincoln retailers, which is appreciated by the local business and government authorities.
\
UNO's hockey attendance averaged 6,900, while the Lincoln Stars averaged 4,146 (first in the USHL last year), so it seems we have a great deal of interest in the area for hockey.
\
Let's try to make this work.

When are the Democrats going to start acting like adults and balance the budget and pay the debt off? God told Israel that they should loan to many nations and not borrow. But we do the opposite.

WARNER AND GAS TAX
\
Joe Hampton's letter (""Fischer deserves thanks,"" April 5) regarding the bill in the Legislature that would partially fund road construction from sales taxes certainly was correct on two points. Sen. Jerry Warner believed that roads were important to the economy. He also put in place a gas tax, which has been a reliable source of funding for our roads ever since.
\
However, I do remember Sen. Warner warning against giving away the state's sales tax base to other political entities. He believed that there is only so much sales tax people will tolerate, and he thought we were getting close to that point.
\
So if Sen. Warner was right, and I think he was, using part of our sales tax base for roads would definitely hurt other parts of the budget. I suspect he would have said that gas tax, which is a user fee, would be the best funding for roads, even today.

I would like to see someone put up a website with a live video feed of the construction of the Haymarket arena project.
\
A camera could be put on the post office building, the train depot or even the Creamery building. People could go to the website and watch the progress. Advertising could be sold for the website, so any expenses would be covered.

I would have liked to have seen a webcam for the Harris Overpass construction. It's interesting to see how these things are built, and those who don't know how it's done would have a good opportunity to learn about it.

GASOLINE BOONDOGGLE
\
A letter (""Ethanol boondoggle,"" April 3) provided an incomplete review of gasoline costs. The real cost of petroleum is significantly higher than the price paid at the pump. Our reliance on petroleum, especially imported oil, carries a very high price to our economy, health, environment and national security.
\
A report by the National Defense Council Foundation concludes that the United States spends $50 billion per year defending Persian Gulf oil. This rapidly increasing cost of oil dependence triggers staggering economic penalties on our economy. These economic penalties today exceed $300 billion annually and impose a hidden cost on every gallon of gasoline extracted from imported oil.
\
The overall economic toll of oil dependence should shock Americans. The cost certainly shocks the U.S. economy. The $220 billion spent annually on foreign oil costs the U.S. economy more than 800,000 jobs per year and deprives federal, state and local governments of more than $13.4 billion in tax revenues. Unfortunately, a portion of that money also funds terrorist operations directly in conflict with U.S. interests.
\
Meanwhile, our fossil fuel dependence creates increasing costs on our health and environment. The American Lung Association estimates that health care costs associated with air pollution exceed $50 billion each year and are growing. And of course Gulf Coast residents and businesses are painfully aware of the costs associated with oil spills that continue to plague the environment, human health and the economy.
\
Biofuels generally and ethanol specifically are making an important contribution to our economy, environment and energy security. Today, ethanol displaces more than 10 percent of the gasoline used in the United States. Contrasted to imported oil, ethanol positively impacts our local and national economies. As consumers contemplate the real cost of transportation fuels, domestically produced renewable ethanol is a bargain.

Age: 50 Address: 62058 719 Road, Elk Creek Occupation: Crop farmer and livestock producer Political party: Republican Heidemann, the incumbent, is chairman of the Legislature's Appropriations Committee. He says he's running for a second term because he thinks it is important ""during these hard economic times that we have proven leadership in key positions to make the right, commonsense decisions.""
\
Heidemann was an Elk Creek school board member for nine years and is a volunteer fire board member.
\
I believe that the majority of roads funding should come from user fees. However, because of the current situation with the lack of roads funding, we may have to look for other sources.
\
Yes. I think it's obvious the law needs to be changed. Although I understand why some feel we need to provide a safe haven for older children, there are some facilities for that kind of situation that exist. I believe the current law is being used for purposes that we never intended.
\
In today's unpredictable economic climate, I believe the cash reserve fund should be used exactly as intended. That would be to bring money out of the cash reserve fund to make up for lost revenues so that we do not have to raise taxes or cut vital programs.

He was inducted as a coach into the Nebraska Football Hall of Fame. Joy says as a college administrator he has extensive experience in economic development and securing funding for capital construction projects. He is chairman of the Stella Village Board.
\
I adamantly oppose the gas tax. We have $575 million in cash reserves. The rainy day is now. I'd invest $60 million in roads and infrastructure, cut waste (which is abundant), and investigate the bidding process, awarding bids to the most efficient companies, and not by the Good Ole' Boy plan.
\
No. Parents are leaving children because they are at the end of their ropes, and the abandoned children are perhaps being saved because of this law. The changes are needed in the system that is failing these parents, most of whom have tried other avenues before finally giving up. The law isn't failing parents and children. The current system is.
\
The rainy day is now. No one builds savings while his house is crumbling! Save most. Spend some. I would invest $60 million each in 1) infrastructure, 2) HHS, and 3) education. If we pay to educate and train our citizens for a few years, then we won't have to pay for social programs for them for the rest of their lives.

""I want to bring jobs to Nebraska, lower our tax burden and promote our state,"" he says. For the past 10 years, Coash has worked in human services, providing support to people with disabilities.
\
With gas prices soaring, now is not the time to increase gas taxes. I opposed and will oppose any attempt to increase gas taxes in the future.
\
Revenue generated from gas tax will continue to decline as automobiles become more efficient. We must use existing revenue now without raising taxes, and we must transition away from solely using the gas tax to fund roads.
\
Yes. I support safe haven laws, but Nebraska's law goes too far. We should lower the age in which a child can be left in a hospital. I propose that the safe haven law extend only to the first 72 hours of a child's life. Alternatives for struggling families and children needing shortterm, out-of-home care must be available.
\
A $575 million reserve means that hard-working Nebraskans are being excessively overtaxed. This money belongs to Nebraskans, not the government. With such an enormous reserve, the Legislature can fully fund programs for those in need, cut taxes on working class families and keep some money for a rainy day.

DAN MARVIN

Age: 49 Address: 2523 Woods Blvd., Lincoln Occupation: Investment adviser Political party: Democrat Marvin, a Lincoln City Council member, also has served on the County-City Planning Commission and other city study groups. Marvin says he can use his experience in city government to build bridges with city and state officials and provide the leadership to get the job done.
\
We need to build the expressway system (including the south beltway) outside the state funding formula. This leaves more funds in the Highway Trust Fund to finish local projects. The state should explore an infrastructure bank to provide additional funds. South Carolina adopted this approach and completed 25 years of projects in 10 years without an increase in gas taxes.
\
Yes. The intent of that law was to provide a way out for a parent of a newborn. In some rare cases, distressed parents of infants had abandoned babies in dumpsters. The intent of the law was to allow, in those cases, a parent to leave an infant off at a hospital or fire station.
\
At the present, economic circumstances are uncertain. Having a substantial cash reserve and a state running in the black is an enviable position. However, when the economic fog clears, I believe that some of the surplus should be used to fund jobs creating infrastructure projects, such as road and research and development. What role, if any, should the state play in legislating illegal immigration?

He is a former member of the Mediation Center board of directors and was a mediator in small claims court. He is a member of the Nebraska Sierra Club executive board.
\
Immigrants, both legal and illegal, come to this country for jobs. Remove availability of jobs to undocumented workers and they will leave. The solution is at the job site. The state must get tough on employers who hire undocumented workers. The state must also work to deport violent criminals who are undocumented.
\
We currently have barely a maintenance budget with little room for new construction. Doing nothing is not an option. Various methods to increase funding include bonding, redirecting vehicle tax to roads, using money from the general fund, increasing the Nebraska gas tax (currently the source of Highway Trust Funds) and seeking increased federal funding. I will study these options.
\
The safe haven law must be amended to reflect its original intent -- keeping babies out of dumpsters. The current occurrences of leaving older children has pointed to a broader problem, namely, Nebraska families unable to function and families that desperately need help. The larger issue is providing help and healing to keep children safe and families together.

JAMES ARTHUR JEFFERS

Age: 75 Address: 1505 Raymond Road, Raymond Occupation: Part-owner, James Arthur Vineyards Political party: Republican Jeffers, a successful small-business owner, says he has the experience and leadership skills to help lower taxes and grow the Nebraska economy with good paying jobs. Jeffers founded James Arthur Vineyards in Raymond, now Nebraska's largest winery. Before that, he participated in creating several other businesses.
\
Jeffers says he's running to make state taxes more family- and businessfriendly.
\
I oppose state-funded benefits for illegal immigration. I believe this is unfair to the taxpayers of Nebraska. Taxpayers should not fund individuals who broke our laws. Furthermore, a college degree does not bestow citizenship. It is unconscionable to saddle illegal immigrants with student-loan debt knowing a career is not available.
\
It was wrong for the Legislature to increase the gas tax when gas was reaching $4 per gallon. I support legislation introduced by Sen. Tony Fulton that would have taken revenue from the motor vehicle tax and place that toward transportation funding. I am disappointed this legislation has not passed. If elected, I will bring common-sense leadership to this issue.
\
Of course changes need to be made. I agree with the intent that infants in Nebraska need a safe haven rather than being in an environment where the parent(s) cannot adequately care for them. The last few weeks have shown the state and private entities must increase their ability to reach out to parents of adolescents and teenagers who need help.

Age: 61 Address: 6111 Chartwell Lane, Lincoln Occupation: CEDARS Home for Children Foundation, executive vice president Political party: Republican Campbell's experience in county government and in the family business and in a nonprofit agency provide her with a unique perspective for leadership, she says. She says she wants to strengthen communities by increasing jobs and broadening the tax base. The structure of state taxes and services will be critical in the next three to five years, she says. And Medicaid reform must be addressed.
\
Children must be prepared and protected, she says, by ensuring safety of abused and neglected kids, emphasizing a strong education system and encouraging opportunities to keep young people in Nebraska communities and on farms.
\
Immigration is a federal responsibility in its regulatory and enforcement roles, as well as the provision of resources to administer the law. Nebraska legislation should be introduced only if it is necessary to ensure state agencies are providing lawful services, to provide education on such, or to support employers in using the verification system to identify undocumented workers.
\
First and foremost, we must protect the Highway Trust Fund and its unique funding mechanism. There is no one solution, but options to be considered include: a ""transportation bank"" with local match, repurposing or redirecting an existing tax, review of the gas tax and its formula, and bonding for expressways or a regionally determined high priority roadway.
\
Yes, it should be amended, lowering the age to protect infants in imminent danger. The cases involving older children are illustrating the juvenile behavioral health system needs attention in order to give families more help before situations escalate. Also needed is awareness of the public and private sector services available for families across the state.

TRAVIS A. WAGNER
\
Age: 62 Address: 7720 Ringneck Drive, Lincoln Occupation: Retired Army National Guard first sergeant; civil service Army National Guard helicopter maintenance technical inspector Political party: Democrat Wagner says his qualifications include experience and the ability to focus on issues and not symptoms, to ask probing questions and to perform and lead others under pressure. Wagner says he wants to ""continue my passion to serve that was developed in the military and provide leadership for Nebraska.""
\
The state should work with business to develop a method of identification that employers can use to identify legal employees. With this tool the attorney general should aggressively prosecute employers who hire illegal immigrants and compete against hard-working legal employers. In-state tuition should be available only to legal state residents. We need to protect our legal employees and employers.
\
I will continue to promote utilization of the existing road user fees. Nebraska's system is the envy of every other state. We should prioritize roads based on measured economic development. Roads to ""nowhere and maybe"" do not need to be funded. We also must begin taking advantage of all federal funds provided, which has not been done in the past.
\
The current use of the Safe Haven Law for older children is a ""cry for help"" by parents and guardians. I would change the law to automatically incorporate a resource for the child in question. A parent should not be made to feel lost and without hope in providing quality care to their children. A child needs to feel wanted. DISTRICT 29

Age: 36 Address: 6100 S. 31st St., Lincoln Occupation: Owner of Guardian Angels Homecare; mechanical engineer Political party: Republican Fulton was appointed by Gov. Dave Heineman in 2006 to fill a vacated seat in District 29. During two sessions, he sat on the Appropriations Committee and the and Maintenance Committee
\
He also has worked with the Nebraska Workforce Investment Board, Lincoln Area Agency on Aging senior companion program, Lincoln Chamber of Commerce public policy committee, Lincoln Independent Business Association and St. Peter's Catholic Church.
\
It is a fundamental injustice to bestow the fruits of a just society on those who have entered it illegally. Last year, I sponsored two of the three bills introduced dealing with illegal immigration. One eliminated state-funded benefits for illegal immigrants; the other encouraged law enforcement's cooperation with federal authorities. These are appropriate measures for the state to enact.
\
We must free ourselves from increasing gas taxes. Roads are too important to depend on the mysterious price of gas. I proposed the existing motor vehicle tax as a future funding mechanism. I also sought a performance audit on the department. If we're empirically certain monies are spent efficiently, then we may effectively seek additional funding -- but not until then.
\
Yes, as soon as is immediately possible. It is apparent we must make age-specific amendments to the existing law. Certainly recent occurrences have demonstrated the urgent need for awareness of existing tools to aid distraught parents. However, the safe haven law should exist for the safety of defenseless infants -- not for distraught parents.
\
SUSAN SCOTT
\
Age: 60 Address: 5343 Cooper Ave., Lincoln Occupation: Consultant/educator Political party: Democrat Scott says she is running because District 29 residents deserve a choice in who represents them in the Legislature. She will build consensus based on the interests of all Nebraskans, advocating especially for the needs of women, children and families, she says. She is concerned about health care, rising property taxes and education.
\
Scott is a 30-year resident of the district and a former executive director of a nonprofit. She is a substitute teacher for Lincoln Public Schools and has been a business consultant for 20 years. She also has served on a long list of community boards.
\
Immigration control is a federal responsibility. Nebraska does not have the financial resources or authority to take over that responsibility. The state should cooperate with the federal government's efforts. I am not in favor of Nebraska adopting a hugely expensive new program in an area in which only a national effort is likely to be effective.
\
Nebraska's first priority must be to assure safe roads and bridges, then maintenance of current infrastructure. Priorities for safety and maintenance will likely consume our current funding sources. We must evaluate our wants versus our needs beyond safety and maintenance and live within our budget as we identify other sources of revenue that could help expand/improve current roads.
\
The flood of abandoned children demonstrates Nebraska's parenting crisis. It demonstrates the need to publicize resources for families like the YWCA Respite Program and 211, Nebraska's Social Services Help Line. This statewide referral number assists families with information regarding respite care, rent/utility assistance, shelters, food banks, mental health and legal services. The safe haven law should apply to infants.

A city department often out of the limelight and doing hard labor may find itself breaking a sweat as it makes what is being described as a hard political sell.
\
The city's Public Works and Utilities Department is spearheading a $17 million move to centralize its operations on the fringes of the city using primarily state fuel tax dollars normally earmarked for fixing, building and operating streets and highways.
\
""It's a legal and appropriate way to use the city's portion of the state gas tax,"" said Roger Figard, city engineer.
\
The idea already is meeting intense questioning from some members of the Lincoln City Council. They say the plan is yet another example of the city administration hastily pushing through its agenda without providing adequate information in a timely manner.
\
Not all council members have been presented with the plan; others privately received an update Monday.
\
""We may take gas tax funds and put them in buildings and structures when that money could be going to roads, and we're screaming about roads?"" said Councilman Glenn Friendt. City officials have reiterated during different phases of the proposed Lincoln-Lancaster County Comprehensive Plan that current revenue sources for transportation projects outlined in the plan fall $346 million short of estimates.
\
The city is also faced with a $5 million-plus revenue shortfall heading into next year's budget.
\
""It's going to be tough. It's going to be tough,"" said Councilman Terry Werner. ""All the decisions in this environment are difficult. We shouldn't be rushed into this.""
\
The administration has set its sights on a large building that sits on 42 acres and was last filled several years ago by the Nash Finch company, which used the building at 800 Cattail Drive as a warehouse and distribution center for grocery stores.
\
Figard said Tuesday that Public Works and Utilities has been a ""good soldier"" in recent years by quietly watching general improvement in other city departments while it suffered with inadequate facilities.
\
The department has three properties that house the equipment and provide workspace for street repairs, signal replacement, offices and a range of other uses. It rents a large building at 531 Westgate, just north of West O Street, for its central facility.
\
Figard said the three facilities are not in prime locations. One will have to move because of the Antelope Valley project, another doesn't have room to grow and the third is on city-owned grounds near the new ballpark.
\
Friendt asked whether one reason for the proposed move is the new ballpark and pressure for the city to leave.
\
Figard said that is not the case and maintained that a new facility is sorely needed.
\
""It seems like we've found a solution to our own problems -- we're not asking anybody else"" for such things as general fund or property tax dollars, he said.
\
Major projects would not be delayed if the plan were approved, but engineering studies on some projects could be decreased and plans to add some turn lanes, for example, could be cut.
\
About a half-dozen other city departments and divisions, as well as the Lancaster County Sheriff's Office, would also be able to use the building and grounds.
\
City officials seek approval from the City Council and Lancaster County Board of Commissioners within the next month so the department can take advantage of what the officials see as a good deal. The listing price is $5.4 million. The city believes it can be bought for less than that.
\
Renovation and improvements would cost an estimated $11 million. The county would pitch in more than $2 million of the total cost.
\
The more than $160,000 yearly rent now paid on the central facility near West O would help pay for the new site. Some rent now paid by a half-dozen other city entities would also be used.
\
The project would be financed through bonds, with initial annual payments of about $366,000, $250,000 of which would come from fuel tax funds.
\
It could be several years before the city would dip deeper into the $15 million annual pool of fuel tax money it receives. Eventually, $750,000-$1 million would be taken from the fund annually over the life of the bonds for the new site.
\
""Is the timing right with budget problems? Probably not,"" Councilman Jon Camp said of the proposal.
\
The sprawling Nash Finch building and grounds in northwest Lincoln are adjacent to the University of Nebraska Technology Park. The 90 or so acres still available for development are nearest to the Nash Finch building.
\
Public works and its equipment wouldn't be ""what I would say is the best partner to have up there,"" said Chuck Henderson, president of Limited Liability, the company that manages the park.

SMOKING BAN A REAL TREAT
\
Way to go, City Council, on the smoking ban.
\
What a treat for our veterans coming home from sacrificing their lives for freedom to find out they can't smoke in their favorite bar or perhaps in their own private business because our City Council comrades have decided we don't need this form of freedom.
\
We are truly better off having our government control our lives. No more God in our country or prayer in school.
\
We as Americans should not have the right to decide such foolish things for ourselves.
\
Keep up the good work. Together, our government can truly make our country great.

\
MORE PRESSING ISSUES
\
In response to the letter by Dr. Les Spry (LJS, July 21), I would like to offer these comments. At this point, smoking is a legal activity and as such should not be a punishable offense.
\
I feel there are no objections to the restaurant ban, but if there were a desire for smoke-free bar environments, I believe the concept of free market would drive this situation.
\
As a lifetime nonsmoker, I have no problem with smoking in bars and feel the free market approach should be the rule.
\
As to the concern for public health, I believe this to be a lie. If it is not, where is the support for health care coverage, lower cost prescriptions, and support for those of us who will die if we cannot get our meds or visit a doctor due to lack of ""health insurance""?
\
I challenge Dr. Spry to tackle these real issues, which are costing far more than 80,000 lives.

\
SPEAK OUT FOR THE KIDS
\
I'm upset to think that when the smoking ban is put before voters, the people that will benefit most will not have a voice in the matter. I'm speaking, of course, of children.
\
Children will have to wait longer before they can go into any restaurant in Lincoln and not be subjected to the foul odor of burning tobacco (yes, it really does smell that bad).
\
This grave injustice occurred to me a few days ago when I was in P.O. Pears.
\
I observed one of the petitions and their children's menu. Not only does P.O.'s apparently cater to children, you can logically determine that it does enough business with them to warrant a separate food selection.
\
On a separate evening, I took my mother to dinner at Brewsky's, was carded (having just turned 21), turned around and watched a couple cart their four small kids into the establishment.
\
I doubt there are few sports bars in Lincoln that don't have such policies.
\
When I was small, one of the worst feelings in the world was being dragged into a dark, smoky bar. Owners are always fast to dismiss the needs, opinions and thoughts of our littlest minors.
\
People may say public smoking is a choice, but it is not the choice of children.
\
If parents care for and respect their children, they wouldn't subject them to that. If you don't believe me, ask your kids what they think; then vote your conscience.

\
WHERE WAS TV COVERAGE?
\
I was shocked and disappointed Tuesday night when I rushed home to watch the Democratic National Convention.
\
I turned from station to station all evening on both television and radio.
\
Apparently the convention was not carried on any station that people who can't afford cable could hear or see.
\
I have followed both parties' conventions from the time Iwas a small child.
\
The conventions are the one chance for the public to hear from those who are running for office and come to our own conclusions, instead of depending on selected sound bites, commercial and otherwise.
\
The conventions give us a chance to hear from both sides, to get a feel for the family and friends of the candidates and to hear from other potential leaders, such as Barack Obama.
\
How unfortunate that we missed the chance to hear what some broadcasters are saying was the most compelling political speech in 30 years.
\
When I called to express my disappointment, a woman at one of the TV stations insisted I had called the previous morning, which Ihadn't, and told me, in a sarcastic tone, ""Well, times are changing. The ratings show people aren't that interested.""
\
What happened to the media as an educational tool? Is it now only about the dollar?
\
Ihave wanted to support network television, as a force for democracy, available to all. I'm afraid it is deteriorating into sop for the lowest common denominator.

GAS TAX IS CHEAPER
\
There has been much talk about ""how to pay for"" the need for additional streets to serve an expanding Lincoln.
\
The proposed solutions were to vote on a general obligation bond to increase property taxes $41 per year per $100,000 valuation and/ or to have an additional 5-cent gas tax.
\
After overcoming the 5-cent sticker shock, the gas tax would be cheaper for my household. My two vehicles burn approximately 55 gallons per month, or 660 gallons per year.
\
The 5-cent tax increase would be $33, or $8 less than paying for the bond.
\
The mathematical break-even approach is this: $50,000 property valuation equals 400 gas gallons; $100,000 valuation equals 820 gallons; $150,000 valuation equals 1,200 gallons; $200,000 valuation equals 1,640 gallons.
\
A major side benefit of the gas tax increase (besides paying for the streets) is that the street users are directly paying for the services that they need and desire.
\
Those individuals that have the large or oversize vehicles (and thus require wider streets and parking stalls) will pay more than the person that uses a fuel-efficient compact.
\
The retired household is not saddled with a 20-year bond tax to pay for streets they seldom use.
\
Most drivers do not know how many gallons of gas they consume (they know just how much they pay).
\
But we have a couple of months before the vote to determine what our gas consumption is.
\
With that information, each voter can truly vote their pocketbook.
\
Russell F. Miller, Lincoln

STATE PARKS ARE THE BEST
\
My husband and I took our boat out to Branched Oak Lake on a recent Sunday. It was such nice weather.
\
The boat docks were extremely crowded, and there were lines to launch and retrieve boats. Under these conditions, I expected to see some losing their temper or trying to buck the line, etc. However, everyone we came in contact with was patient and in good humor. This made the day so much more pleasant.
\
We have found that our Nebraska State Parks are the best of all the states we have traveled to so far. Thanks to you all!
\
Linda Steiner, Lincoln
\
DEFINING 'FAMILY VALUES'
\
It is another election year, and we are again hearing about candidates who have family values. However, the term ""family values"" is somewhat confusing to me. It seems that the candidates who say they have these values take positions that are just the opposite. To me, a candidate who has family values is:
\
1) In favor of reproductive choice, so that every child is born wanted.
\
2) Opposed to the war in Iraq, because it is disruptive to so many families and, in some cases, kills or maims fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, etc.
\
3) In favor of strengthening the institution of marriage by extending that right to gays and lesbians.
\
4)In favor of separation of church and state, so that no religion can unduly influence the way we govern ourselves and the government cannot unduly influence families' choices as to what religion to practice.
\
So when you go to the polls this November, please remember which candidates really believe in family values.
\
Do not be confused.

DON'T TOLERATE GOUGING
\
I thought the state leaders of Nebraska promised us to fully go after anyone suspected of price gouging gasoline? Guess what, look in your own backyard at our ""local"" oil suppliers gouging us on a daily basis. I will explain.
\
Last Wednesday, Aug. 31, I had the unfortunate pleasure of driving from Lincoln to Wichita, Kan., and then to Des Moines, Iowa, and return back to Lincoln all in one day. I left Lincoln filling up at $3.29 a gallon for gas at a popular station owned by a ""local"" oil company. Then on to Wichita where I paid $2.79 a gallon for gasoline. (They also told me at the station in Kansas they had not raised prices for a while now.) By 4:30 p.m., on my last stop in Des Moines, I paid $2.79 a gallon for gas again.
\
By the way, the next day in Council Bluffs, Iowa, I still only paid $2.89 a gallon for gas while Lincoln was still at $3.29. I understand Lincoln's and the state of Nebraska's outrageous gas tax they inflict on us, but come on, a 50 cents a gallon difference?! We are being gouged daily.
\
I challenge every resident of Lincoln to call a relative in the United States and ask them what they are paying for a gallon of gasoline. Then write or call your city and state leaders and let them know you are not happy! Let them know you will not tolerate price gouging of gasoline in our own backyard.

\
SHARE THE HUSKER WEALTH
\
Help me understand this. It is announced that the university athletics program brings in revenues of $114 million to Nebraska. And yet the university is cutting programs, scrimping on faculty salaries and raising tuition. All the while the Athletic Department, of course, works to figure out new ways to get rid of the money pouring into their coffers.
\
At what point, exactly, will the faculty... you know, those dreary folks who handle all that teaching, research, service and other trivial nonsense associated with an educational institution... see some of the largesse? Isn't it about time for the profiteers to invest some of their enormous revenue into the institution that makes their profits possible? Does Nebraska know that without the faculty and classes there would be no football program?
\
Roger Welsch, Dannebrog
\
WE CAN DEFEAT FEAR
\
As gas and heating oil prices soar, pictures from New Orleans temper our discomfort with shock and sorrow.
\
Perhaps this tragedy will finally awaken the grass-roots fortitude of a proud nation as we remember our greatest enemy is fear. We can defeat terrorism with confidence, trust and faith in ourselves as well as our neighbors, but only if we work together and muster the courage to reach out. Terrorism alert levels and Patriot legislation are poor substitutes for solidarity; they merely feed our fears and sell out our freedoms.
\
As poverty in America rises for the fourth consecutive year, this administration pushes for permanent tax breaks for the wealthiest 1 percent of our nation. At the end of the day we will be remembered for what we did for our neighbors in need, not the tax breaks constructed at their expense. Cutting revenue in the face of huge deficits and a war is unprecedented. Power and wealth have corrupted this administration beyond repair, yet they scoff at any dissension, stooping to multiple attacks on the mother of a fallen soldier.
\
These people have a strategic plan to widen the gap between the haves and have-nots to the point of immense wealth and power for a few, as poverty and despair grows for many. Millions of these are children with no health care, victims of divide-and-conquer leadership.
\
Sens. Hagel and Nelson should be commended for speaking out and taking bipartisan action amidst a culture of fear in Washington so carefully crafted by those in power.
\
If we can find the courage to reach across the divide in our own communities, we can begin to come together as a nation. It's a dream that has become a necessity; together we must make a change.
\
Steven D. Burbach, Lincoln
\
KEEP AN OPEN MIND
\
As one who finds Leon Satterfield's columns funny and thought provoking (although, I usually disagree) I was apalled by the mean- spiritedness of his recent column (""The president and 'intelligent design'"").
\
The fact remains that although evolution is what is taught as the way everything has come to be, it still is only unproven theory. Unfortunately, the event that brought us all to this point cannot be recreated, so we can never know for sure, but the idea of criticizing one as being silly for believing that we are here for a purpose, created by one greater than us, is no more absurd than the idea of nothing creating something.
\
There are many theories that have been proven wrong by one person defying the establishment, and believing the contrary (see Christopher Columbus, the flat planet, and the birth of the new world). We struggle to create an environment for our children to have an ""open mind"" but cringe at the thought of them being presented an alternative.
\
So, as long as evolution is still a theory, why not let them ponder the thought of a creation and a purpose? Why is someone like Leon Satterfield so afraid of that happening? Would it be so bad if others, like me, disagree with this theory?
\
Maybe 100,000 years from now when my descendents are giant supermen, I'll be proven wrong. But for right now, since Leon can't prove to me that I am wrong, what's the point in calling me ""goofy""?
\

\
LEAVE COUPLE ALONE
\
Jon Bruning should find someone else to pick on. Matt and Crystal Koso are married and have a child they love. How he can call this rape is beyond me. They care for each other and their child, so please leave them alone. Jail would certainly mess up this little family and for no good reason. (Can you guess that I am outraged?)

LOCAL VIEW
\
Any decision to move the 107-yearold Nebraska State Fair should be by a vote of the people.
\
The Legislature decided, at a cost of $42.5 million, to move the State Fair to Grand Island and give the University of Nebraska-Lincoln 251 acres for an innovation park when it already owns hundreds of acres in Lancaster County.
\
Our buildings at State Fair Park are insured for $70 million. Those buildings will be demolished. We are being robbed of that $70 million in addition to the $42.5 million for a total of $112.5 million. And on top of that price tag, the State Fair is being moved to a place where very little actually will be owned by the state for that investment.
\
The State Fair is produced through its roots in 93 counties, county fairs, county agricultural societies and 4-H programs. It is the premier exhibit of agricultural products in the state, but the fairgrounds, throughout its history, has always been all of that and more.
\
In addition to the State Fair being moved, most all of the events that are held throughout the year at State Fair Park -- 1,001 revenue-generating event days during 2008 -- also will be gone. The fairgrounds are used all year, not just for the 11 days of the State Fair.
\
Most of those events will not move to Grand Island. They will no longer exist because of the lack of an appropriate venue and rising gas prices. It is impossible to calculate the dollars that are being lost to individual vendors who use State Fair Park for their events. Events such as horse racing, swap meets, chariot races, car shows, dog club activities, gun shows, Americruise, antiques shows, Christmas tree sales, toy shows, buckle shows, just to name a few. Because of these losses, there will be a decline in state sales tax collected, a decline in income tax collected and a decline in gas tax collected.
\
The State Fair and horse racing support each other at State Fair Park. Splitting those entities could easily spell the death of both. Horse breeding and racing, like all other agricultural industries in our state, deserve our attention and care.
\
Consultants hired by the Legislature said a successful State Fair should have 300,000 people living within 50 miles of the event. Grand Island does not meet that requirement, meaning a much smaller attendance. The Legislature paid a consultant for advice and then did not follow that advice.
\
The university's innovation park concept, and it is just that -- concept, it has no current commitments -- is estimated to cost $100 million to $300 million and could take 20 years or more to develop. With the limited research dollars available and the extremely competitive environment for them, this experiment does not merit gutting State Fair Park. And if we do that, who is going to pay that $100 million to $300 million for development? The taxpayer -- AGAIN!
\
UNL has done a poor job with its Technology Park. Past performance is a good indicator of future performance. Why would we not look closely at the past performance of UNL before handing it a blank check? If an innovation park is such a great idea, why not start sensibily by using that $42.5 million to build on land it already owns in Lancaster County?
\
FairVoteNebraska.com has sent more referendum petitions to Hall County than to any other. It is apparent that Grand Island taxpayers understand the implications of moving the State Fair better than did the Nebraska Legislature. In these austere times, Grand Island does not want an increase in its local and state taxes to cover the cost of this move. Additionally, it will have the burden of raising $300,000 or more each year to match the 10 percent state lottery funds.
\
Before there was a state, there was a fair. The Nebraska State Fair began in 1859. It is older than the state of Nebraska and 10 years older than the university.
\
Millions of feet have trod the grounds of the Nebraska State Fair and left not just their footprints, but by simply attending have left pieces of themselves and have taken with them greater knowledge, joy and sunburns or muddy shoes.
\
Any decision to move the 107-yearold State Fair and spend more than $100 million to do so should be by a vote of the people.

12,"
The historic 100th Legislature wrapped up Thursday after two sessions. In all, 1,176 bills - not including appropriations bills - were filed, had public hearings or were dealt with in some fashion. Bills that didn't pass died on the floor or in committee, or were withdrawn by the senators who introduced them.
\
As of Friday, Gov. Dave Heineman had vetoed five second-session bills. Four passed over his objections. They concerned fluoride requirements, petition circulators and a 1.2-cent gas tax. One veto that stood had to do with a portion of funding for the Omaha area learning community board.
\
He had approved 151 bills from the second session by Friday.
\
Here is a look at major bills and resolutions taken up in the second session and their disposition.
\
MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS
\
State fair/research park. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln will get State Fair Park for a research park and the fair will move to Grand Island in 2010. The state will provide $5 million from the cash reserve fund for the $42 million move to Grand Island. (LB1116, Sen. Phil Erdman)
\
Statewide smoking ban. A statewide ban on smoking in restaurants and bars will begin June 1, 2009. Retail stores selling only tobacco and related products will be exempt. (LB395, Sen. Joel Johnson)
\
Statewide testing. Uniform statewide testing will be required in reading, math and science in many elementary and high school grades. Reading tests will begin in 2009-10, math tests the following year and science in 2011-12. (LB1157, Sen. Ron Raikes)
\
State aid. Senators changed the state aid formula to give more money to schools with high-cost students. Omaha Public Schools dropped a lawsuit involving funding after the measure passed. (LB988, Sen. Ron Raikes)
\
BUDGET
\
Gas. Senators made minor changes in the two-year, $6.8 billion budget. One to raise the gas tax, likely by 1.2 cents, passed over the governor's line-item veto.
\
Reserve. Senators spent cautiously from the cash reserve, or rainy day, fund, leaving an estimated $469 million to help avoid deep cuts or tax hikes if a recession slows down state tax revenue.
\
Schools. Senators trimmed state aid to schools, which would have risen around 17.5 percent. The less costly state aid program assured a balanced budget but still raised aid to schools by about 9 percent.
\
HEALTH
\
Fluoride. All cities with populations of 1,000 or more will be required to put fluoride in their water, unless there is a natural source.Voters in cities and villages can opt out of the requirements. Senators overrode governor's veto. (LB245, Johnson)
\
First responders. Emergency responders who suffer mental illness after witnessing violent acts could get workers' compensation benefits. (LB819, Business and Labor Committee).*
\
CRIME
\
Jurors. Jurors will be able to take notes during trials. The measure, sponsored by Sen. Carroll Burling, was among 10 bills packaged together in LB1014.
\
Marijuana. Possessing less than an ounce of marijuana will remain an infraction, but the fine will go from $100 to $300 on the first offense. (LB844, Sen. Russ Karpisek)
\
Scams. Some newer scams will fall under the state's deceptive practices act, giving the attorney general greater authority. They include sending unsolicited checks that obligate the recipient to pay for goods or services and unsolicited billing statements charging consumers for goods or services not purchased.(LB781, Sen. Kent Rogert)*
\
Rodeos. Tripping horses and pulling steers to the ground by the tail would be banned. The Nebraska Humane Society objected to these events, which are common in Mexican rodeos. (LB764, Sen. Abbie Cornett)
\
Ignition interlock. People convicted of driving under the influence would be required to lease and use ignition interlock devices to determine if they have been drinking if they want to drive. Offenders would be limited to driving to work, school or counseling. (LB736, Sen. Tony Fulton)
\
GOVERNMENT
\
Cultural preservation. The Nebraska Cultural Preservation Endowment Fund will get $5 million from the cash reserve fund over three years. The money will go into the endowment fund and the interest, matched by private funds, will be used for arts organizations, arts education and arts advocacy. (LB1165, Sen. John Nelson)
\
Beatrice. A special legislative committee will explore problems at the Beatrice State Developmental Center and look at the statewide system of caring for people with developmental disabilities in local communities. (LR283, Sen. Mike Flood)
\
Circulators. People who circulate statewide petitions will have to be paid by the hour rather than the signature, and they'll have to be at least 18 and live in Nebraska. Senators overrode a governor's veto. (LB39, Sen. DiAnna Schimek)
\
Public speaking. Local governmental bodies can no longer require members of the public to be placed on the agenda before being allowed to speak. (LB962, Sen. Don Preister)
\
Robocalls. Automatically dialed calls could be made only between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m., but the number of calls would not be regulated. Calls must state who is paying for the call and for whom it is being made, along with contact information of the person making the call. For political calls, the message would be required to be filed with the Public Service Commission within 24 hours after the message is transmitted. (LB720, Schimek)*
\
Lancaster elections. Lancaster County commissioners will be elected by voters in their districts at both the primary and general election. (LB268, Sen. Amanda McGill)
\
HEALTH
\
Birth certificates. Parents of stillborn babies will be able to get birth certificates from the state, in addition to death certificates. (LB1048, Sen. Danielle Nantkes)
\
Safe haven. Nebraska became the last state in the nation to offer a legal safe haven for women who feel they must abandon a baby. The law is broader than most and allows a parent to leave an infant or child at a hospital without facing abandonment charges. (LB157, Sen. Arnie Stuthman)
\
TAXES
\
Corporation. Corporations will pay the lowest income tax rate on the first $100,000 in income rather than on just the first $50,000.(LB888, Sen. Carroll Burling)
\
Gas. Gas tax will likely rise by 1.2 cents per gallon this summer because senators added $14.5 million to the Roads Department budget to pay for rising salary and health insurance costs. Senators overrode a governor's veto to provide the additional funding to roads. (LB959, major budget bill)
\
Super advantage. A sixth tier was added to the state's major tax incentive program for companies that create high-paying jobs. (LB895, Sen. Ray Janssen, at request of governor)
\
Fuel. The way Nebraska calculates a portion of its fuel tax will change in 2009. Part of the fuel tax will be tied to the wholesale price of gasoline and will rise and fall with the price of fuel. The change will not automatically lead to higher fuel taxes but could make it easier to increase the gas tax in the future. (LB846, Sen. Deb Fischer)*
\
DRIVING AND ROADS
\
Driver's licenses. Licenses will be mailed to drivers' homes as part of an effort to avoid possible employee fraud. Nebraskans will also be required to show two forms of ID when getting a license. The new system is expected by April 1.(LB911, Sen. Carol Hudkins)*
\
Lights. An old state law prohibiting the use of parking lights during the day was repealed. The measure, sponsored by Sen. Rich Pahls, was included in LB756 with several other bills.
\
Construction. Senators took $115 million from the cash reserve fund, $5 million a year for three years, to be used as the state match for road projects that have a federal earmark, including Lincoln's south beltway. (LB846, Fischer)
\
EDUCATION
\
Stem cells. State dollars cannot be used to destroy a human embryo, for cloning or research. State money can't be used for somatic cell nuclear transfer - in which a cell, such as a skin cell, is transferred into an unfertilized human egg to make embryonic stem cells. The University of Nebraska Medical Center could continue to use cell lines in existence before 2001 from other sources for research. Also, a stem cell research cash fund was created to provide matching money of as much as $500,000 a year. (LB606, Sen. Brad Ashford)
\
WATER/ENVIRONMENT
\
Efficiency. Electric companies will be able to participate in a grant program that helps low-income homeowners make their homes more energy-efficient. (LB1001, Sen. Tom White)
\
Irrigator payments. The state will compensate irrigators in the Republican River Basin who gave up surface water rights in 2007 as part of a plan to meet the terms of a water compact with Kansas. A lawsuit over the local funding mechanism meant irrigators did not receive money in December for the leased water rights as promised. The $9 million for the payments will come from the cash reserve fund and is a loan that will be repaid when the lawsuit ends. (LB1094, Sen. Tom Carlson)
\
E-waste. TV and computer manufacturers will pay a registration fee into a state grant program to be used for recycling programs. Manufacturers also will be encouraged to set up programs for returning equipment, at no cost to the consumer. (LB986, Preister)*
\
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS
\
Economic development. A proposed amendment will be on the November general election ballot to allow cities or villages to pay for economic or industrial development projects from sources including local occupational taxes or utility charges. Now, only local property and sales taxes can be used. (LR229CA, Sen. Vickie McDonald)
\
Bonds for nonprofits. A proposed amendment on the May primary ballot would allow local governments to use bonds to develop property on behalf of nonprofit agencies. The agencies, not government, would be ultimately responsible for paying off the bonds. (LR5CA, Sen. Mike Friend)
\
* Passed on final day of session, with no decision yet by governor.
\
FAILED TO PASS
\
Seat belts on buses. Schools would have been required to buy buses with lap and shoulder seatbelts after Jan. 1. The bill stalled on the floor, opposed in part because of the cost. Opponents described it as an unfunded mandate. (LB1092, Sen. John Harms)
\
Lab test mark-ups. Doctors would be prohibited from marking up on charges for such lab tests as skin biopsies and Pap smears when they do not perform the tests. The measure stalled on the floor. (LB1104, Fulton)
\
Death penalty. For the second year in a row, senators failed to give a bill repealing the state's death penalty first-round approval. (LB1063, Sen. Ernie Chambers)
\
Nepotism. New rules prohibiting hiring, promoting or advancing family members in state government, or directly or indirectly recommending them to be hired died in committee. (LB981, Sen. Pete Pirsch)
\
Gender balance. A bill requiring gender balance on state boards and other appointed groups died in committee. (LB824, Schimek)
\
Immigration. A bill that would have required state and other government agencies to verify the legal status of immigrants applying for benefits, contracts, professional and commercial licenses, public housing, food assistance or other assistance died in committee. It also would have taken in-state college tuition allowance away from undocumented students who graduated from Nebraska high schools. (LB952, Friend)
\
Slavery. A measure that would express ""profound regret"" for the state's role in slavery and apologize for wrongs inflicted by slavery and its aftereffects was withdrawn by the sponsor after the language was watered down by the Judiciary Committee. (LR284, Sen. Dwite Pedersen)
\
Affirmative action. The sponsor withdrew a proposed constitutional amendment that would have prohibited the state from discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education or public contracting. Supporters of a similar proposal are collecting signatures to get the issue on the November ballot.(LR233CA, Sen. Mark Christensen)
\
Helmets. An attempt to repeal the state's motorcycle helmet law failed to get enough votes on first-round debate. (LB253, Rogert)
\
Expressways. A bill requiring the Roads Department to specifically look at benefits of the expressway system to local towns during its planning process died without first-round debate. (LB1129, Flood)
\
Small schools. A bill that would have allowed for the creation of small schools under the control of K-12 districts was killed in committee. (LB903, Sen. Steve Lathrop)
\
Family farms. A bill restricting much non-family ownership of agricultural land failed to enough votes at the first-round stage. The measure was intended to encourage family farming and was a response to the death of Initiative 300, a constitutional amendment banning corporate farming in the state. The measure passed by Nebraska voters in 1982 was struck down by the courts in 2006. (LB1174, Sen. Cap Dierks)

LIBA forum poses five questions to five City Council candidates.
\
Quick. In less than 72 seconds, say how you'd close the city's projected budget deficit of nearly $9 million.
\
That was the dilemma facing five City Council candidates running for two seats as they faced the Lincoln Independent Business Association on Tuesday. They were given six minutes to answer five questions, though they had the questions in advance of the forum.
\
In May, Lincoln voters will elect City Council members to represent the northeast, southeast, southwest and northwest districts. The candidates running in the southwest and northwest districts faced LIBA members Tuesday. Candidates in the other two districts will get their chance next month.
\
District 3
\
In southwest Lincoln, Councilman Jonathan Cook is being challenged by Republican John Erickson.
\
Jonathan Cook, Democratic incumbent, said he's running for a third term on the council because his constituents want someone to protect parks, pools, playgrounds, libraries, schools and neighborhood businesses while holding the line on taxes.
\
He said the city's biggest issue is ""keeping our financial house in order,"" demanding accountability from city departments and finding spending cuts.
\
Cook, a computer software developer, reminded people that he was the council member who largely crafted a budget compromise last year that cut $2.8 million out of the mayor's budget, $1.5 million of which were his cuts.
\
He said he supported the mayor's hiring freeze, a pilot early retirement plan for city employees, removal of an automatic cost-of- living raise for management employees and switching to a self- insured health care plan.
\
And he said he plans to propose restructuring several city departments, starting with public works, and plans to make the city bus system more ""responsive and entrepreneurial.""
\
He said he will continue to find budget cuts that keep the city property tax rate low.
\
John Erickson, Republican, said he's running for the council because Lincoln needs new leadership.
\
He said his top priority will be to create a more business- friendly environment to help foster job creation. He'd do that by making more industrial sites available to businesses, planning for development at the city's edge and considering such new tools as utility districts.
\
Erickson, a policy adviser to Gov. Dave Heineman, said the city needs to make it easier for developers to annex land and make its development process more transparent and customer-friendly.
\
By encouraging job growth, the city will reduce its reliance on property taxes, he said. He said the city needs to build relationships between city departments, the mayor and council, the city and school district and the city and business community.
\
Rather than focus on disagreement, he said, city leaders should focus on areas or agreement, and he would provide leadership, re- establish trust and find solutions.
\
District 4
\
Republicans Justin Larsen and John Spatz are challenging Councilwoman Annette McRoy, who represents northwest Lincoln.
\
Justin Larsen, Republican, said he's running because young people need to get involved and because he wants to see more good jobs created. The city's biggest issues are its budget deficit and job creation, he said, and if more jobs are created, that will help erase the budget deficit.
\
The city must be more business-friendly to attract manufacturing companies, he said. The permitting process needs to be speeded up, he said.
\
And he suggested the wheel tax be repealed and gas tax be increased, so out-of-towners contribute more to road construction and maintenance.
\
He said he'd do everything he could to keep property taxes stable, while improving the city's infrastructure. He'd like to see a freeway in Lincoln, like Omaha's.
\
Larsen is a response management coordinator for Union Pacific Railroad in Omaha.
\
Annette McRoy, Democrat, said it has been a ""deep, personal privilege"" to serve on the council.
\
She believes the city is at a crossroads with several big-ticket projects under way, including the Antelope Valley project, and competing for dollars while a budget deficit looms.
\
But she said that's all good: ""It shows that Lincoln is growing and we are investing in our future.""
\
McRoy, who works in real estate, said the city needs ""diversity of leaders"" to decide how to balance its limited resources and make sure no portion of the community is left behind.
\
Lagging sales tax revenue could be propped up through economic development, but she said the city doesn't create jobs, it creates an environment that attracts employers.
\
She also promised to continue to look at ways to lower the ""budget elephant in the room"" - city's personnel costs, which she said are a ""huge part of the problem.""
\
She also promised to rise above petty politics.
\
""Being responsive to citizens is not the domain or Republicans or Democrats,"" she said, ""it's all of our jobs.""
\
John Spatz, Republican, told the business group he is running because of ""jobs, jobs, jobs.""
\
Lincoln still has work to do in improving its environment for job growth. The city needs to be a partner, not a barrier, he said, and other problems will start to disappear.
\
He said the city needs a vision, 15 years out, of where it wants its infrastructure to be, from industrial zones to freeways.
\
""I believe if you build infrastructure, business will come,"" he said.
\
He said the emergence of the 2015 Vision group of community leaders is exciting and offers an opportunity for the city to move forward.
\
""I would like to be at the table when some of those decisions are being made,"" he said.
\
Spatz, legal counsel for the Nebraska Association of School Boards, said he would bring problem-solving skills to the city.
\
He said he'd balance the city's budget by prioritizing city services and improving the business climate. He said Lincoln's property taxes are high enough and he has no intention of raising them.
\
He wants to see more people get off the interstate to spend money in Lincoln.
\
""I would like to see a flowering business environment,"" he said.

Potholes in two older areas of Lincoln will soon become a vague memory.
\
The city Public Works & Utilities Department presented to the City Council Monday its $4 million battle plan for resurfacing city streets. Work will be concentrated in two areas, one in northeast Lincoln and the other around the Near South Neighborhood.
\
This is the second year the department will work to fix everything inside specific boundaries, rather than resurface streets hit and miss across the city, said City Engineer Roger Figard. This is the first year of a larger resurfacing budget, he said.
\
""There was conscious recognition that we must take care of the built environment,"" he said. The city cannot just build new roads, he said. In previous years, the city spent in the range of $2 million to $3 million on resurfacing, he said. ""We'll begin to slowly inflate that each year.""
\
Money for resurfacing comes from the wheel tax, state gas tax and state vehicle registration fees.
\
The city has completed repairs in the area of South Street and S. 48th Street. Some other areas may take two or three years to complete, said Al Imig, deputy city engineer.
\
""We'll stay there until we finish and then move on,"" he said. ""If we have a street (elsewhere) that deteriorates significantly, that does not preclude us from going out and doing that, too,"" he said. ""We'll try not to do it unless it's a drastic situation.""
\
The city also will improve some major road arterials and intersections, including Cornhusker Highway east of 48th Street.

Unveiling what he called a bold, innovative and strategic two-year budget facing a projected $986 million revenue gap, Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman told lawmakers Thursday that his priorities are to create jobs, grow education and oppose any and all tax increases.
\
But his plan also has its share of spending cuts and operational efficiencies -- $672 million -- that would include an estimated 450 to 500 state jobs, all but about 100 of which have gone unfilled when they became vacant over the past year or so. ""This budget is about priorities and making difficult
\
decisions about the most important responsibilities of state government. I've listened to our citizens, and their priorities are creating jobs, improving the economy and strengthening education,"" he said during his annual State of the State address to lawmakers. ""My budget proposal significantly reduces funding for many agencies and eliminates several programs.""
\
Many of the cuts came from a sweeping review done by all state agencies and offices last year to find ways to save money.
\
""The decisions were difficult but necessary,"" Heineman said. ""We are facing unprecedented financial challenges. The national economy is recovering slowly, and many are predicting a jobless recovery.""
\
Most of the rest of the shortfall would be made up with a $260 million transfer from the state's cash reserve fund.
\
The governor said his plan to make a one-time, $25 million investment in the University of Nebraska's Innovation Campus would help jump-start the project, in which the university and the city are turning the former state fairgrounds into an area for research and development businesses.
\
""The University of Nebraska is a critical component to our state's economic future. With its pending move to the Big Ten, the University of Nebraska has an outstanding opportunity to significantly increase student enrollment, expand its rapidly growing research base and develop publicprivate partnerships at Innovation Campus that will increase job opportunities for Nebraskans,"" he said. ""This bold investment is needed now, not five years from now.
\
""Economic success and education success are linked together. We need both,"" Heineman said. ""We are focused on creating higherpaying jobs and developing a more highly educated work force. We want our graduates and young professionals to be prepared for high-quality, high-skill jobs with dynamic companies doing business right here in Nebraska.""
\
His budget also takes no money from the university, state and community college systems or state aid to schools.
\
And Heineman was adamant in his pledge not to raise taxes.
\
""I want to be very clear. I am opposed to any income, sales, alcohol, cigarette or gas tax increases,"" he said.
\
Heineman said he is prepared to take criticism and fight for his budget.
\
""It will be easy for lobbyists and special interest groups to criticize individual components of this budget, but in this challenging financial environment, their criticism will lack credibility unless they are willing to offer an alternative budget proposal for the state of Nebraska,"" he said.
\
""You and I have to pass a balanced budget. If special interests want to be critical, then they need to present their own plan. If they want to spend more on Medicaid, then the question is do they want to reduce education funding or raise taxes? If they want to spend more on state aid to education, do they want to cut Medicaid provider rates further or raise taxes?
\
""These are the challenges and trade-offs we face in developing a budget,"" he said.

A product of the '70s, I took President Jimmy Carter calling our dependence on foreign oil the ""moral equivalent of war"" very seriously. Then as quickly as it happened, the solar panels came off the White House and in came the era of sport-utility vehicles and cheap oil.
\
How cheap? The Center for Technology Assessment reports that external costs in the form of tax breaks, subsidies, etc., when added to the retail price of gas, raise it to $5.60 to $15.14 per gallon. It seems now our only energy policy revolves around aircraft carriers and cruise missiles.
\
Higher gas prices are a wake-up call and, I believe, a long-term blessing. It imposes conservation on people, business and government. Auto manufacturers will be forced to improve fuel efficiency. Since vehicles are our major polluter this would translate into a direct, positive impact on the environment.
\
A car getting 30 miles per gallon emits half the pollution as one getting 15 mpg. With more realistic fuel prices, mass transit becomes more attractive. Alternative fuels (which are not as heavily subsidized as gas and oil) become viable. Extensive use of biofuels could provide a valuable market for the hard-hit agricultural economy.
\
I truly believe that the days of commuting in SUVs and 4x4 pickups will go down in the books as a most embarrassing time in American history, a testament to the waste and excess of our present society.
\
People are asking Congress to do something. Had the government placed a realistic tax on gas, or at least eliminated the massive subsidies, we could have weaned ourselves off foreign oil years ago. Instead we are at the mercy of the free-market economy that Americans hold so highly.
\
My wife and I have chosen to contribute to the problem as little as possible (with no assistance or incentive from the government or utilities). The majority of our driving is done in our electric Honda Civic that I converted from gas about four years ago, or a Sebring Vangard CitiCar I just restored. Electricity is primarily produced from domestic energy sources and much is renewable.
\
We recharge at night when there is excess available from the power plants. Even considering power plant emissions and the loss from transmission lines, electric vehicles are about 90 percent cleaner than the equivalent gas car. This is assuming the cars are new and warmed up. Gas cars get dirtier as they age while electric vehicles get cleaner due to ever-tightening emission standards on the utilities.
\
For long trips we use our Geo Metro at 48 mpg.
\
I always thought that in a democracy the government's role is not to dictate morality or impose restrictions on personal freedoms but to focus on the long-term good of the country. Our leaders (as well as the media) have been very shortsighted when it comes to our energy policy. I have heard little or no mention of the main problem: getting off the foreign oil.
\
Even if there are no political disruptions or other unforeseen circumstances, oil is a finite resource and will run out early this century. Please let us focus on long-term solutions to this problem. Knee-jerk reactions such as repealing the federal gas tax or opening the petroleum reserve will only be detrimental. Politicians seem to have no idea of the real problem, only political pageantry and opportunity to place blame.

Nebraskans now pay 12 times as much in state and local taxes as they did in 1950.
\
Of course, they also make five times as much on average, pay nine times as much for a new car and shell out 25 times as much for an evening at the movies, according to a newly released report.
\
The report, issued by the Nebraska Tax Research Council, looks at several key numbers to show the differences -- and similarities -- between the state in 1950 and the state now.
\
""The intent was not to draw attention to any particular area,"" said John Jordison, council president of the nonprofit, nonpartisan group that analyzes state and local fiscal issues. ""Our intent was to present a lot of interesting data that people could digest.""
\
Much has changed in nearly 40 years, he said, including the prices paid for most consumer goods and the average income of Nebraska workers. But the per-person total of state and local taxes has changed more than either.
\
Nebraskans paid an average of $190 a year in state and local taxes in 1950. By 1996, the latest year available, they paid $2,531 on average.
\
""The tax burden was roughly 5 percent of average annual income then. It's 10 (percent) to 11 percent now,"" Jordison said.
\
But Sen. Roger Wehrbein of Plattsmouth, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said Nebraskans also got less for their tax dollars -- and expected less -- four decades ago. ""It's a bigger market basket today for government services,"" he said. ""I do think there's a lot more demands for services that have been worked into the cost of government in the last 40 years.""
\
Back then, Nebraska had no sales or income taxes and the gas tax did not cover diesel fuels. State government was funded through property taxes, as were local government units. It wasn't until 1967 that the state property tax was abolished and sales and income taxes were established.
\
But in 1950, the state also had no interstate highway system and hundreds fewer miles of paved roads to maintain. There was no Medicaid system to provide health care for poor families and disabled residents or nursing home care for the elderly. Children with disabilities didn't get special education and those with mental retardation couldn't count on services in the community once they grew up. Families in need had fewer aid programs to help out. Only two state prisons housed criminals.
\
State and local agencies relied on pen, paper and typewriters to keep records, not computers. A statewide educational television network had not been created, no agency had been charged with protecting the environment from air and water pollution and court appeals went directly from local courts to the Nebraska Supreme Court.
\
""We've asked state and local government to take on more that we did not ask in 1950,"" Jordison said. ""That absolutely has to be kept in mind.""
\
Even so, Nebraskans of 1950 were upset with how big a bite taxes took from their paychecks and were concerned about the cost of living. The same complaints are alive now, despite efforts in the meantime to give property tax relief, the report said.
\
""The fiscal issues and concerns of 1950 are still very much concerns in 1999,"" it said.

I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND
\
There is something I am having a great deal of difficulty understanding as we move closer to this presidential election. I cannot understand those who say they support George Bush because he is ""such a good Christian.""
\
I know what he claims, but what is it that he has done in the past three and a half years that shows what a good Christian he is?
\
Was it his putting tax breaks for the rich above the needs of the poor? Was it the lies told to get us into a pre-emptive war? Was it the callous attacks against anyone who dared to disagree with him? Or was it, maybe, his putting corporate greed before protection of the environment?
\
I am not a biblical scholar, but I do believe in the teachings of Christ. My understanding has always been that Christ taught that our actions of compassion showed our true heart, not our words.

GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT
\
It is with great disappointment with the editors of the Lincoln Journal Star that I feel compelled to respond to the recent Journal Star headline of the Associated Press article, ""Doctors implicated in abuses."" To elevate the article to front-page status despite a marginal presentation of substantiated information does both a disservice to the newspaper's reputation and more importantly to the reputation of the thousands of honorable men and women who serve our country in the armed forces.
\
I have had the great pleasure to both serve in the military as a registered nurse during Vietnam and an even greater honor to be the wife of an Army physician who served in Desert Storm as an Army Reservist. And in these more than 30 years of federal service within its health care system, we have met hundreds of men and women who do their jobs honorably and with a proud sense of duty and responsibility for the country they serve. In addition, these professionals make great sacrifices, both personally and professionally. Many of these professionals have lucrative careers, take substantial pay cuts and risk losing their practices and sometimes their very lives because they are willing to bring their talents to a war zone next to all our brave young men and women. Does the Journal Star get that part?
\
So how dare the Lincoln Journal Star stain the reputation of the thousands of men and women who do their job with dedication and honor by painting a broad brush picture of military medicine by what, at best, ""may"" be the sins of a few. It would be good to remember that we depend on the extraordinary gift of courage that our military men and women give to us each day. It allows the newspaper its free press.

EVERYONE WANTS A CUT
\
When is it going to stop? It seems to me that every time I open the paper or turn on the television the local, state or federal government is telling me they need just a few more cents of my hard- earned money to protect or serve me better. All I really want is for these politicians to show me some real improvement to quality of life with the money they already take from me.
\
I, like many other citizens, believe street improvements are needed in some areas. I, like many other citizens, believe that property tax, excise tax, wheel tax, gas tax and all the other little taxes we pay that amount to a pop a day or a meal once a week add up darn quick. These so-called little amounts may total half, or more, when all tax is added up of our paychecks.
\
When the people who control spending of tax dollars start to make good choices with the money that we already give them, then I will have no problem voting for increases. So for now, I urge all Nebraskans to vote no on any more increases no matter how they play on our fears, because right now my greatest fear is someday I will wake up and realize I have no paycheck at all.

A legislative bill would exempt such vehicles from an annual permit fee in lieu of gas tax.
\
So much for being a good citizen.
\
Frank Brooks of Lincoln thought he was helping the environment and reducing the nation's dependence on foreign oil when he bought his new Toyota Prius, a hybrid car that uses gasoline and electricity for power.
\
But the state sent him a $75 bill because his fuel-efficient car means Brooks hasn't been paying his share of gas taxes.
\
The bill from the Department of Revenue is for the state's Annual Alternative Fuel User Permit.
\
Brooks calls it a tax.
\
""I got kind of upset,"" said Brooks, who bought his first Prius in 2000 and hasn't been charged for a permit before.
\
The Prius uses gasoline but also generates electricity and stores it in a battery for use with the engine. That means the car uses less fuel and has fewer exhaust emissions.
\
The federal government gave Brooks a $2,000 tax credit when he bought his Prius because he was using an alternative fuel: electricity.
\
""I think this is a terrible thing that the state would do that and pick on this particular system,"" Brooks said. ""I probably wouldn't buy another one because it's an unfair tax. It's not the money. It's the idea.""
\
Janet Lake, administrator of motor fuels for the state Department of Revenue, said a bill (LB983)has been introduced to exempt hybrid vehicles from the alternative fuel permit.
\
""I don't think the intention was ever to pick up these hybrid vehicles,"" she said, referring to the early 1990s legislation that created the permit. ""It's not a big revenue source.""
\
Lake said the purpose of the permit was to tax vehicles that are not powered solely by traditional fuels such as gasoline and diesel.
\
The theory:Vehicles that use alternative fuels, even in part, are not paying their fair share of tax revenue. Nebraska depends on fuel taxes - about $300 million annually - to pay for its roads.
\
County treasurers are supposed to notify the revenue department when a hybrid vehicle is licensed, but apparently not all counties are doing so or are aware of the requirement.
\
Lake said the revenue department sent out fewer than 10 bills for the alternative fuel permit last year. That was far fewer than the 26 Prius vehicles delivered by Performance Toyota, a Lincoln car dealership, in 2003.
\
""I was almost shocked,"" said Performance general manager Steve Kurtz, recalling his reaction when told about the permit and the $75 fee.
\
""Can you believe the federal government gives you a ($2,000) credit for buying one of these vehicles and the state of Nebraska sends you a $75 fee?""
\
Kurtz said he called several car dealers in Kansas to find out whether that state had such a permit. Their response: ""They laughed at me.""
\
John Albers of Lincoln plans to drive home a new Prius soon. He ordered the car, which is in high demand, in October. Albers said he is going to pay the fee but isn't happy about it.
\
""It's taxing an alternative fuel source that's already been taxed,"" he said.
\
Lake said the Revenue Department is trying to rectify the situation with LB983, which was placed on general file after a hearing Friday. If passed, the bill would take effect Jan. 1, 2005.
\
The permit does not apply to the Honda Insight, another popular hybrid vehicle. Unlike the Prius, Lake said, theInsight does not generate enough electricity to propel the vehicle.
\
Brooks said he thought about not paying the fee but decided to send in the money after talking to family members.
\
""I paid it under protest,"" he said. ""I put that right on the check.""

GYMNASIUM SEX SHOW
\
The Abercrombie and Fitch window and the Journal Star's coverage pale in comparison to what I saw at half-time of the high school basketball game tonight. The kindergarten, first and second graders got laughter and applause for imitating the sexually explicit moves of the high school girls. Then the dance team performed. Following fashion, they entertained like sex workers, no imagination needed, very little skill or talent needed; just do what's natural on the gym floor like mating animals. It's too bad Lincoln's dance instructors don't have the imagination and courage to go against the fashion.
\
We can forget our concern about men abusing women under these circumstances because the women are abusing themselves by treating themselves like sex-objects. In this environment, women can't even recognize substandard treatment from men. If the clothes, attitudes and behavior of women communicate that sex is their goal, then they've objectified themselves. Our society has attempted to protect teens from exploitation in past generations.Now we're just marketing it and encouraging capitulation.
\
The human body is beautiful. Dance is an art form. It's the cheapening of these that made the half-time show an embarrassment. I felt relieved to watch the basketball game because it was honest effort and accomplishment, not pandering.

RECONSIDER MULTIPLEX
\
I am writing in response to plans to create a multiplex movie theater to replace the majority of theaters in downtown Lincoln.
\
Before moving on with this idea, Lincoln really needs to reconsider the plan. The mayor and other officials stress the importance of the downtown area in the city, and I could not agree more, but a multi-complex of theaters will not be the success that they think it will be. The current situation of several different and unique theaters is a quality that many cities wish they still had. Leave the multiplexes for the lost world of the sprawl-ridden suburbs.
\
If you need an example of what this multiplex will be you have to look no further than 50 miles to the northeast. Omaha has a 24- theater multiplex known as the AMC 24. Visit this theater on any night and you will witness a drop zone for teenagers, loud teenagers. I am still in my 20s, so I have not quite reached the ""when-I-was-a-kid"" stage, but I do understand that this atmosphere is one that college students and beyond will not enjoy. If you want to continue to keep the downtown strong you don't want to alienate the student population with its proximity to downtown, or even the fresh-out-of-college, first-time-with-an-income 20-somethings who are probably the major demographic during peak movie-going hours.
\
Please, please reconsider what this multiplex will do to the atmosphere of downtown Lincoln. Do not make the mistake that so many other cities have already made and are trying to repair.
\
I lived in Lincoln for the first 26 years of my life and will be moving back within the next couple of years and would hate to see a downtown that is turned into an amusement park upon my return.
\
If all of the theaters are in one location, you will then create a situation where people will park in close proximity to this theater, walk to the movie, and then return to their cars without interaction with the downtown and all of the other attractions it has to offer. Please consider all of the implications before you make a decision on this.

TAX TAXES, NOT FOOD
\
Instead of taxing food to help cover the $673 million state budget shortfall, senators should put a 7 percent sales tax on taxes! Nebraska would be out of the red in no time if each person had to pay an additional 7 percent sales tax on their federal and state income tax, Social Security tax, real estate tax, car tax, cigarette tax, liquor tax, gas tax, hotel tax, etc.

DISTORTING REALITY
\
I do not understand the Lincoln Journal Star's overzealous effort to publicize every comment, protest or demonstration by the Nebraskan's for Peace organization. What is the connection between the LJS and these people? Are Journal Star staff members involved with this group? Do they call the Journal Star every time they want the newspaper to print their statements?
\
Even if only five or six of their protesters appear at the State Capitol or the Federal building, the Journal Star publishes articles with pictures and quotes from their members. Their membership is miniscule, and they are but a tiny fragment of nearly 2 million Nebraskans, most of whom disagree with their views.
\
It would not be a misrepresentation of fact to characterize their ideology as being left of the far left. Maybe it's just because they are so far from the mainstream that the Journal Star finds their positions fascinating, that the newspaper reported on their actions so extensively that one might conclude that they are the most important and powerful political organization in Lincoln.
\
I realize that sometimes the Journal Star has to go out and make news in order to find something of interest to report, but the newspaper has created a distortion of the overall importance of this fringe organization. It's great to live in a free country, where those who deny logic, facts, and even reality itself, can still speak out freely. The Journal Star, however, ought to act a little more responsibly and tender its coverage of these folks by resisting its impulse to rush out and report on this organization every time they speak out.

PLAYERS ALREADY PAID
\
Have Nebraska lawmakers finally lost their minds? The last thing I heard, right as I was heading out the door for class, was an ESPN show talking about how Nebraska was debating on paying football players for playing here. Now as I was walking to class (a concept some football players may find confusing), I was thinking about how much money I was spending to take those classes. I also thought about how a lot of football players do not worry about paying for classes because they have athletic scholarships.
\
I thought about my friend saying how he overheard the Spanish- teaching faculty being told to be ""lenient"" with the football players and their performance in their classes. I thought about all that snappy gear that athletes get for free or for very cheap from the department -- and believe me, you can see the people on campus if they are on campus. And I thought, ""You know what? I think they get paid pretty darn well already."" As long as it stays UNL and not UNFL, the top priority here is academics -- not athletics.

HONOR THE FALLEN HEROES
\
More of our heroes die. This time it is four U.S. soldiers killed in the crash of a Black Hawk helicopter during a training mission in Kuwait. The short article in the Feb. 25 Journal Star appeared on Page 3A in the News Briefs. Their identities are unknown pending notification of next of kin.
\
Back to Jan. 31, Page 3A: Four U.S. soldiers were killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan. Evidently their next of kin had been notified, because we were given their names and ages, the regiment they were in, their rank, and home state of each. No picture, no hometown, no word about their parents, or wives or children, or how much they were loved or cherished, or how well they served.
\
No, they were not astronauts, but they do have Nebraska connections. They are serving in the United States military to defend our country, including we who live in Nebraska.
\
Let us all get our priorities in order. If we cannot stop the war, at least let us honor our fallen heroes -- on the front page. I pray we don't have to do it very often.

Steve and Ardis Holland of Lincoln like to sit under a shady pergola and watch their Lincoln Electric System meter spin backward instead of forward like most electric meters do. All thanks to their solar array.
\
Steve and Ardis Holland of Lincoln say they don't have PV disease, yet.
\
But the retired couple do like to sit under a shady pergola and watch their Lincoln Electric System meter spin backward instead of forward like most electric meters do.
\
The tongue-in-cheek disease reference describes people with photovoltaic (PV) solar arrays who switch off appliances to watch their meter spin in the opposite direction.
\
The Hollands' meter spins backward when their solar array generates more electricity than their bungalow-style home uses.
\
They're among 22 LES customers who generate electricity and sell the surplus to the utility. Fifteen customers have solar arrays and seven have small wind turbines.
\
The Hollands' solar array has 20 panels mounted on their garage roof. Each panel is 40 inches wide and five-and-a-half feet long. Inside are photovoltaic cells, which convert the sun's energy into power. The array's generating capacity is 4.8 kilowatts -- equal to 48 light bulbs.
\
""We are extremely happy at this point,"" said Steve Holland, pointing out features of the solar array. That wasn't the case when the retired couple began researching solar energy for their home.
\
""I was a little leery at first because it was a big outlay of money,"" Ardis said.
\
Their solar array, installed by SWT Energy Inc. of Lincoln, cost $19,200, but a 30 percent federal tax credit of $5,760 and a one-time LES capacity payment of $1,320 reduced the total (after taxes) to $12,120.
\
Randy Schantell, CEO of SWT Energy, estimates it will take 11 and a half years for the solar array to pay for itself.
\
The Hollands, who drive a fuel-efficient 2008 Toyota Prius, said they'll be able to help the environment while, hopefully, saving money over the lifespan of the array, expected to last at least 20 years.
\
The first-year energy savings is estimated at $633, and that should increase as electric rates increase, Schantell said.
\
Steve Holland figured the $633 translates into an initial return of 5.2 percent on their investment ""which is more than the bank will give us.""
\
LES is one of the first electric utilities in Nebraska with a net-metering program, where a utility sets a price and buys back electricity from customers who have installed renewable energy generation, usually solar or wind.
\
As of March 1, the LES buy-back rate is 4.7 cents per kilowatt-hour.
\
Marc Shkolnick, manager of energy services, said LES has embraced solar arrays over small wind turbines because the former help more during peak demand periods of hot summer days.
\
""Solar typically performs on our system better than wind. On a hot, humid, sultry summer's day, the wind doesn't blow but the sun is certainly shining,"" Shkolnick said.
\
At this point, the amount of electricity generated by the 22 net-metering customers is insignificant, because the total capacity amounts to 90 kilowatts. That's minuscule when compared to the utility's record peak demand of 786 megawatts set last August.
\
But Shkolnick said LES is looking to the day when more customers install solar arrays.
\
Schantell and Shkolnick said solar energy is becoming more attractive to homeowners because prices have come down due to advances in photovoltaic technology, manufacturing improvements and lower labor costs overseas. Plus more companies, especially those in China, are flooding the market with products.
\
""These are not large systems in the grand scheme of things,"" Shkolnick said. ""Generally speaking, customers will not generate more than they consume in a given month.""
\
The couple will soon get a new meter that tells them how much electricity they are generating and how much they are selling to LES. Eventually, they will be able to get that information on their computer. The utility and the Hollands will ""settle up"" at the end of each month.
\
""The real value (of their solar array) is they are offsetting their need to buy power from LES at a (higher) retail rate,"" Shkolnick said. ""If they generate 100 kilowatt-hours, it is 100 they don't have to buy from LES.""
\
Steve Holland said he looked at installing a wind turbine initially but chose a solar array because of low maintenance -- you have to clean the panels off about once a year -- and the recent drop in pricing.
\
Shkolnick suggested that people who want to install a solar array should do the fundamentals first: weatherize their home or business, raise their thermostats and install energy-efficient lighting to try to reduce their energy bills.
\
Steve Holland hopes that the solar array reduces their annual electricity bill by 33 to 50 percent.
\
""Even if we don't save money, our kids and grandkids will save money,"" Ardis Holland said.

OUR VIEW
\
City and state law books need updating to reflect the 21st century reality of energy prices. Two examples were spotlighted in the Journal Star in recent days. As Lincolnite Laura LaDue learned, she has to wear a helmet while driving her three-wheel electric car because it's classified as a motorcycle under state law. So do her passengers She even needed a motorcycle license to drive the car, called a Xebra. That's absurd. All she wanted to do was save some money and help the environment. The car accomplishes those goals. A full charge that propels the Xebra about 25 to 40 miles at a top speed of 40 miles per hour costs only 14 cents. ""The design and concept of the new vehicles that are coming out is ahead of the vehicle definitions that are in our statutes,"" said Betty Johnson, an official with the Department of Motor Vehicles.
\
LaDue has contacted state senators in hopes that someone will change the law and allow her to take off her helmet, which she thinks obstructs her vision and makes driving the vehicle more dangerous.
\
Also standing in the path of Lincoln residents who would like to harness the power of the wind to generate electricity are zoning laws that make it almost impossible to install wind turbines.
\
Proposals to change those requirements already are under way. City Planner Mike DeKalb is drafting changes to the city zoning code that would legalize the turbines.
\
Small wind turbines with blades about four feet in diameter and mounted on a roof like a satellite dish can generate between 400 and 700 kilowatt hours a month.
\
A turbine of that size can be purchased for around $3,500, plus installation costs of about $500. Savings on a residential electric bill would run about $25 to $45 a month at the new rates just approved for the Lincoln Electric System. Tax credits are available to farmers, ranchers, businesses and communities under 50,000.
\
Even with the latest LES rate, it probably would would take more than 10 years to pay for the system. That may change, however, as the price of fossil fuels is projected to continue rising rapidly. And wind turbines with larger blades generate more electricity.
\
Already in place in Lincoln is approved ""net metering,"" which allows consumers who generate their own electricity with wind or photovoltaic solar panels to sell power to LES at retail rates.
\
Certainly, as local and state officials consider changing laws to give local citizens more energy options, other concerns such as safety also will have to be weighed. There's little doubt, however, that the existing laws are far too obstructive.

Dear EarthTalk: What tax or other government incentives are there for buying green, for individuals as well as businesses? - Sarah Rafferty, New York, N.Y.
\
There are a laundry list of tax rebates and other financial incentives designed to encourage individuals and businesses to go the greener mile. At the federal level, individuals can reap the rewards of eight financial incentives ranging from tax credits and home loans for replacing windows and installing insulation around the house to tax rebates for purchasing a hybrid car or hooking up a solar hot water heater.
\
Nearly every state also has state or local incentives available. Many require utilities to rebate consumers who save electricity. Some utilities even offer ""net metering,"" where consumers who generate some of their power through rooftop solar panels or other technologies can sell electricity back to the utility, thus reducing or zeroing out their electric bill - even earning money.
\
Businesses can reap financial incentives, as well. At the federal level, examples include an energy-efficient commercial buildings tax deduction, a business energy reduction tax credit, an energy- efficient appliance tax credit for manufacturers, and a new energy- efficient tax credit for green-savvy builders.
\
At the state level, many are eager to attract renewable energy companies and offer tax breaks to get them there. Washington state, for example, charges no sales tax on renewable energy equipment produced or sold there. And some cities are offering ""density bonuses"" and green building incentives to developers and builders to encourage sustainable land use.
\
The best place to look for what's available is the free online Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency, a comprehensive source of information on state, local, utility and federal incentives that promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. DSIRE is a federally funded project of the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, whose membership includes state and local government agencies, national laboratories, renewable energy companies and advocacy groups.
\
In Canada, the Office of Energy Efficiency at Natural Resources Canada offers federal grants and incentives. The agency also administers the High Efficiency Home Heating System Cost Relief program, which will contribute up to $300 to homeowners who upgrade their old oil or gas furnace or boiler to a new high-efficiency model. Another Canadian program, the Vehicle Efficiency Incentive (VEI) rewards those who buy fuel-efficient cars or trucks with rebates of up to $2,000 each. Selected provinces and cities also offer incentives to those looking to save energy and the environment.

LOCAL VIEW
\
As we wrapped-up Independence Day celebrations, I recalled the meaning behind this important holiday, the birthday of our country. The founders had a clear vision for this country based in the belief that all Americans are entitled to the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
\
Today, our dependency on foreign oil and the effects of global climate change put these fundamental rights at risk.
\
At first, it is hard to find a connection between life, liberty, happiness and energy but if you look closely, the American way of life depends heavily on the access to energy sources. With great demands for energy, it becomes a challenge to use energy in a responsible manner; therefore, we must consider the impact and negative repercussions of generating electricity burning fossil fuels and oil products.
\
We need to be serious about reducing greenhouse emissions and break our dependency on foreign energy. The strategy and resources for achieving such goals can be found right here in Nebraska. It is essential we develop renewable energy resources to meet our country's energy demand.
\
With the transition to a clean energy economy, the United States can accelerate the economic recovery by opening roads to private investment and putting hundreds of thousands of Americans back to work.
\
As a small business owner of a solar company in rural Nebraska, I offer sales, design and installation services of solar systems for homeowners and businesses. As part of the initial contact, I usually ask people what is their motivation to buy a solar system.
\
All of them seem to share the same answer,""I want to take control of my energy future, and I am very concerned about increasing energy prices.""
\
The state of Nebraska does not have a Renewable Portfolio Standard, so it is difficult for my business to grow and hire more workers.
\
(An RPS requires electric utilities and other retail electric providers to supply a specified minimum amount of customer load with electricity from eligible renewable energy sources.)
\
Nationally, Nebraska ranks third in the country for wind energy and, in the top 12 for solar potential.
\
A national standard will open the doors for companies like mine to develop these resources, contribute to the economy and produce private-sector jobs.
\
Without a standard, my business might not be able to make it into the next year.
\
I urge members of both parties in Congress to work together to resolve this energy and climate issue, putting the best interest of the country before special interest and scare tactics.
\
The founders created government to guarantee all Americans the right to grow in a healthy environment and seek happiness in a free country.
\
The role of government should be to protect its citizens and make sure those ideals stay intact for generations to come.
\
The time has come for our elected officials to act and pass a comprehensive energy and climate bill that works for America and protects our freedom.
\
The politics of delay and denial are a serious threat to the founder's ideals and the American way of life.
