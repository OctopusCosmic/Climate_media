WASHINGTON >> Mitt Romney, true to his roots as the son of an auto executive, was talking about cars.
\
It was May 2006. Romney, the Massachusetts governor, was chatting up his Montana counterpart about his vision for an energy-efficient car of the future - lightweight and narrow, with tandem-style seating, so that two vehicles could drive side by side in one highway lane.
\
""He was getting animated about all these little cars that would be driving around in these lanes,"" Brian Schweitzer, the Montana governor, recalled in an interview. Schweitzer, a Democrat, laughed, thinking about how Republicans might react. ""I said, 'Mitt, if you ever run for president, don't ever talk about that again.""'
\
Today, as the Republican nominee for president, Romney is far more apt to talk about oil drilling than energy-efficient cars. He has presented a plan to open up more land and coastline to oil and gas drilling, grant speedy approval to the Keystone pipeline to transport crude oil from Canada to the United States, end wind and solar power subsidies and curb regulations that discourage burning coal for electricity. It is an agenda far different than the one he outlined in his early days as governor.
\
He populated his Massachusetts administration with environmentalists, including one, Gina McCarthy, who now runs the clean air division of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama. He railed against the ""Filthy Five,"" high-polluting power plants in the state. He issued a ""climate protection plan"" and lauded it as ""among the strongest in our nation."" Under his direction, Massachusetts helped create a regional cap-and-trade program - anathema to most Republicans - intended to cut the greenhouse gas emissions that scientists believe cause global warming.
\
But at the last minute, Romney refused to sign the greenhouse gas pact that his aides had spent more than two years negotiating; industry opposed it, and some former Romney policy advisers say his political team feared that it would doom his chances for the presidency. A current campaign policy adviser, Oren Cass, said Romney simply evaluated the proposal and ""concluded the costs imposed on the economy would be too high.""
\
Today in Massachusetts, environmentalists credit Romney with helping to promote smart growth and reducing air pollution by putting in place tough regulations curbing certain toxic emissions from power plants. They also praise him for signing into law a bill embracing oil spill prevention measures. But many feel betrayed by his surprise reversal on the climate change pact.
\
""He was ahead of his time and very progressive,"" said Jack Clarke, who was appointed to an ocean management task force by Romney and now directs public policy at Mass Audubon, a conservation group. ""But by the end of his administration, he seemed to have gotten Potomac fever. The conservation agenda he had didn't seem to be a core conviction.""
\
A POLICY DEVELOPS
\
Romney got an up-close lesson in conservation growing up in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., where his father, George, ran the American Motors Corp. The car company, which like its competitors marketed big, gas-hungry cars, was struggling. George Romney turned the company around by marketing the Rambler - a boxy, no-frills but fuel-efficient vehicle. Time Magazine put him on its cover.
\
""One of the most anticipated announcements at our house every year was the winner of the Mobil Economy Run, and Rambler often won because it achieved 30 miles a gallon or more - not bad even by today's standards,"" Romney wrote in his book, ""No Apology."" ""Dad called his competitors' cars 'gas guzzling dinosaurs,' a term that he helped make popular.""
\
Decades later, when he was governor, Romney remarked to an adviser, Rob Gray, that ""we'd be a lot better off in this country if we had European gas prices"" because Americans would buy more energy-efficient cars. He also invited Amory B. Lovins, the head of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit research organization devoted to energy efficiency, to meet with him in Boston. While Lovins ""shared his vision of a 75 mpg hybrid automobile built with high strength steel and composites,"" Romney wrote, ""I shared my own dream for a super-efficient commuter vehicle.""
\
When Romney ran for governor in 2002, he fashioned himself ""in the tradition of New England Yankee Republicans,"" Clarke said - a tradition in which ""the environment is a nonpartisan issue."" He was animated by ideas like smart growth and sustainable development, former aides say. He wanted high-density housing clustered near public transportation, pedestrian-friendly urban areas and parks. To carry out his vision, he created an Office of Commonwealth Development, headed by an uber-secretary who would integrate policy in housing, transportation, energy and the environment.
\
The man Romney installed in that job was Doug Foy, who had spent 25 years at the helm of the Conservation Law Foundation, an advocacy group that had sued Massachusetts numerous times on matters ranging from air pollution to cleaning up Boston Harbor. Foy says he found Romney ""intellectually struck"" by environmental concerns, though he filtered them through a business-friendly lens.
\
He would ask, ""Is there a role for government, or do you just let the market rip?"" Foy recalled.
\
Foy's hiring rankled business executives. Environmentalists, though, were thrilled.
\
""It was like Nixon to China,"" said Ian Bowles, a Democrat who later served as energy secretary to Deval Patrick, the current Massachusetts governor. ""Here was a left-leaning Republican who was going to be able to accomplish things on the environment that Democrats had not been able to do.
\
Here's the CEO of the most powerful environmental group, going to take on a super-secretariat with the governor saying all the right things on greenhouse gases, smart growth and the clean tech industry.""
\
One of the first issues Romney and Foy tackled involved an aging coal plant in Salem, Mass., that was spewing dirty particulates and was required by state regulations to clean up by 2004. The plant's owner wanted extra time. The governor said no; three weeks into his administration, he denounced the company at a news conference.
\
""He strongly wanted to clean up the air,"" said Eric Kriss, who founded the private equity firm Bain Capital with Romney and followed him to the Statehouse to become finance secretary. The governor and his entourage drove to Salem, where Romney confronted angry pickets - coal workers who said he was costing them their jobs.
\
""I will not create jobs or hold jobs that kill people,"" Romney thundered. ""And that plant, that plant kills people.""
\
'NO REGRETS' STRATEGY
\
By the time Romney took office in January 2003, Massachusetts was already developing a ""climate protection plan"" focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Back then Romney - who has said he believes that ""climate change is occurring"" and that ""human activity is a contributing factor,"" though he is not certain how much - simply avoided the question of the scientific evidence, which prompts skepticism from some conservatives.
\
""We didn't have a big conversation about the science,"" said Sonia Hamel, who advised Romney on climate change.
\
The resulting 53-page document, released in 2004, laid out a blueprint for what Romney called his ""no regrets"" strategy. It called for, among other things, reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2010 - a pledge adopted in 2001 by a bipartisan group of New England governors - and it promoted hybrid cars and ""clean, fuel-efficient vehicles for the state fleet."" Romney argued that no matter what people believed about climate change, the measures would be good for the economy.
\
In New York, another Republican governor, George E. Pataki, wanted to do even more. In the summer of 2003, Pataki invited Romney to participate in regional negotiations to develop a cap-and-trade program - a market-based trading system to regulate emissions from power plants, in which businesses would buy and sell pollution credits - for states in the Northeast. Romney said he was open to the idea.
\
Power companies and other businesses lobbied against the plan, saying it would drive up electricity costs. At a clean energy conference in November 2005, though, Romney spoke favorably of it. ""This is a great thing for the Commonwealth,"" he said, according to The Boston Globe, arguing that the pact would prompt businesses to develop clean and renewable energy technology.
\
But the following month, after more than two years of intense negotiations between Massachusetts and eight other states - Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont - Romney started getting cold feet. Hamel, who was leading the negotiations for Massachusetts, said Romney's chief of staff, Beth Myers, insisted that Romney would sign on only if the deal included a limit on what power plants would have to pay to emit pollution - a condition that New York and several other states opposed.
\
Myers declined to be interviewed. Hamel saw Myers' involvement as a sign that Romney's political team was concerned about how the plan would affect his presidential ambitions. Franz Litz, the chief negotiator for New York, said he viewed Romney's new conditions as ""a ruse.""
\
But Eric Kriss, the Bain co-founder, said the process simply reflected Romney's decision-making style.
\
""I think he just didn't get comfortable at the very end, but he didn't want to stop a creative activity,"" Kriss said. ""It was like that at Bain Capital. He would let some partner pursue some deal, and at the end he would say, 'I know you worked on this for six months, but we're not going to do it.""'
\
The other states eventually went ahead without Massachusetts (and Rhode Island, which also dropped out), and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, known as ""REGGIE,"" became the first market-based regulatory program in the nation focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Massachusetts has since joined under Patrick, but in New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, has announced his intention to drop out.
\
On Dec. 12, 2005, in an interview on national television, Romney embraced drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge - a position that, like his withdrawal from the cap-and-trade negotiations, aligned him more closely with the right wing of his party.
\
A few days later, the governor informed the people of Massachusetts that he would not be seeking re-election - a sign, many residents believed, that he had set his sights on the presidency.

"
1,"MAN, LAND AND SEA\Carbon dioxide a growing threat to ocean life\The debate over reducing greenhouse gas emissions - through renewable energy, cap-and-trade programs, more fuel-efficient cars - often comes down to the cost. Is the price tag worth the effort to combat climate change?\When it comes to the world's oceans, the answer should be an unequivocal yes.\The evidence is mounting that the effects of too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can cause significant damage to coral reefs and marine life, particularly shellfish.\The oceans already absorb as much as one-third of atmospheric CO2, serving as a critical buffer against climate change. Pumping more CO2 into the atmosphere - which humans have been doing robustly since the Industrial Revolution - causes seawater to become more acidic, stunting the ability of corals, larvae and calcifying marine life to grow.\The long-term consequences are not well understood; ocean acidification is a young field of study. Nonetheless, observations show that ocean acidity has increased by 30 percent since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. And combined with another greenhouse gas effect - warmer ocean temperatures that can cause coral bleaching - scientists warn of the possibility of major disruptions in the marine food chain.\Coral ecosystems are nurseries and feeding grounds for many marine species, including those with commercial value. If coral erosion outpaces growth, and reefs start dying and disappearing, the result could be catastrophic, and not only for the environment.\Commercial fisheries and societies whose economies depend on the sea - including Hawai'i's tourism industry -could suffer billions of dollars in losses. Protection from shoreline storm surges that reefs provide could also disappear.\Beyond the economic consequences, protecting a vibrant ocean ecosystem should be cause enough to push harder for energy alternatives. After all, protecting our ocean environment for future generations is our fundamental responsibility."

I am deeply disappointed in the City Council's recent decisions (""City budget ratchets up fees,"" Star-Advertiser, June 8).
\
Increasing the parking meter fees? When is the last time City Council members paid for parking?
\
Increasing the vehicle weight tax for cars? We are a two-job, two-car family. We need each car to get to work. We are struggling. Now I have to pay more so I can get to work.
\
For those who can't afford a car and take the bus, well, they covered that too, didn't they?
\
And not closing the loophole for the plastic bag ban? Our state just received national attention for standing with the Paris accord and the Council chose not to do away with all plastic bags? Disgraceful, embarrassing, disheartening. The members of the City Council could have been leaders. They could have been visionaries. They could have been for the people. Instead, they chose the path of greed and destruction. Shame on them.

City fee increases will hurt Chinatown 
\
We are in a bind financially due to a blatant lack of fiscal accountability and leadership. Now the small business owners of Chinatown are the ones who are being punished (""City budget ratchets up fees,"" Star-Advertiser, June 8).
\
I want to thank our City Council member Carol Fukunaga, who tried to omit Chinatown from the measure, and the other Council members who pushed against Bill 12. We should be promoting economic drivers for Chinatown, not deterring customers from visiting.

Liberals should overreact to Trump 
\
Are liberals overreacing?
\
President Donald Trump joined North Korea and Nicaragua instead of 193 other countries with a climate change agenda. You see nothing wrong with that?
\
Trump wants to give Russian President Vladimir Putin a pass for the murders of dissidents in Russia, the invasion of Georgia, Ukraine, Crimea, and for propping up Bashar Assad in Syria, helping him murder women and children. You see nothing wrong with that?
\
His only accomplishments are rollbacks of President Barack Obama's positions on clean water, air, Dodd-Frank, etc. You see nothing wrong with that?
\
It seems like Trump actually obstructed justice, maybe even committed treason. But you see nothing wrong with that?
\
It really is time to overreact, in Congress, town halls, the streets, everywhere and anywhere. Republicans are trying to give Trump a pass for all this, so yes. Overreact. Shake the hell out of everybody.

Cal Thomas misleads on acid rain study 
\
Cal Thomas' column is misleading and misrepresents several actual facts (""The 'scientific consensus' has a poor track record,"" Star-Advertiser, June 6).
\
His statement that ""after 10 years and $500 million, the national Acid Rain Precipitation Assessment Program study concluded, 'That acid rain was not damaging forests ... caused no measurable health problems'"" is a lie. The report concluded the opposite.
\
We grew up in the devastation caused by acid rain from Midwest power plants burning coal with high sulfur content. Early Environmental Protection Agency regulations did not go far enough to provide adequate safeguards. It took lawsuits against the federal government and power plant companies by eight northeastern states and the province of Ontario to abate power plant discharges.
\
Documented changes in the environment have since been realized and can still be improved. Note it took a Republican president, George H.W. Bush, to sign into law a cap-and-trade approach to control these sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions.

Homeless a crisis in neighborhoods 
\
It's very distressing to read article after article about the homeless and see very little progress being made. This is not a new problem. It was a crisis 10 years ago and it's a crisis still. Problems were identified but solutions are slow to be imple- mented, if they are implemented at all.
\
Unless you live in the area affected, it is hard to appreciate the impact it has on a neighborhood. There seems to be more consideration given to the homeless with ""compassionate disruption"" than to the residents who live and work in the area.
\
We are the ones who pay taxes for the upkeep of the streets and parks that we can no longer use because it is overrun with the homeless and their tents, tarps, shopping carts, and even human excrement.
\
The choice should be a shelter or jail, not chasing them from one park to the next.
\
They should not be allowed to disrupt a community to the extent that they have.

One of Hawaii island's largest power suppliers and one of the state's two oil refineries say they can't meet legal requirements for reducing air pollution as the state moves forward on an eight-year-old law that requires Hawaii to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.
\
Act 234, signed into law by former Gov. Linda Lingle, affects about two dozen facilities, which are required to reduce emissions by 16 percent.
\
Hamakua Energy Partners, which supplies up to 30 percent of Hawaii island's electricity needs, says that there aren't any cost-effective solutions to reducing emissions at its petroleum-burning plant in Honokaa and that its electricity is too important to the island to cut production.
\
Meanwhile, Chevron says that the state emission rules are unfair as they relate to its Kapolei refinery because emissions at the facility haven't increased since 1990.
\
The companies laid out their objections to state emission rules in greenhouse gas reduction plans that were filed with the state Department of Health in June and obtained by the Honolulu Star-Advertiser through an open records request.
\
Both companies have asked health officials to exempt them from the 16 percent reduction requirement, according to the documents.
\
Nolan Hirai, who oversees the Health Department's Clean Air Branch, said that the department can approve a reduction lower than 16 percent for a facility if the company can show that it is not technically or financially feasible to achieve the reduction. However, no decisions have been made on whether to approve the requests.
\
Both companies could face fines of up to $25,000 a day for not complying with the state law if they aren't granted exemptions.
\
Jeff Mikulina, executive director of the Blue Planet Foundation, a clean energy advocacy organization based in Honolulu, said that the company filings reflect the original need for the law.
\
""It just shows the current thinking,"" he said, in reference to fossil fuel-burning companies. ""It really doesn't reflect that this is a new era and we are going to have to make changes.""
\
Hawaii ranked 15th among states in per capita greenhouse gas emissions, according to Environmental Protection Agency data for 2014. The 2007 law was passed in response to growing concern by lawmakers about the impact of global warming on Hawaii's economy and natural resources.
\
""The potential adverse effects of global warming include a rise in sea levels resulting in the displacement of businesses and residences and the inundation of Hawaii's freshwater aquifers, damage to marine ecosystems and the natural environment, extended drought and loss of soil moisture, an increase in the spread of infectious diseases, and an increase in the severity of storms and extreme weather events,"" according to the text of the law.
\
Five companies, including Hawaiian Electric Co., Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar Co., Kalaeloa Partners, the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative and Hu Honua, all filed plans that laid out strategies for meeting the state reduction targets, which include adopting more renewables, implementing energy efficiency measures and possibly switching to natural gas.
\
AES, the state's only coal plant, and Hawaii Independent Energy, the state's other oil refinery -- both of which operate on Oahu -- are expected to file their plans with the Health Department later this year after being granted extensions.
\
Paul Karaffa, environmental coordinator for AES, told the Star-Advertiser that the company expects to meet or exceed the emission requirements through burning alternative fuels. The company, which supplies about one-fifth of Oahu's electricity, has been experimenting with burning recycled fuel wood.
\
Hawaii Independent Energy didn't respond to specific questions about the refinery's plans to reduce emissions.
\
Lance Tanaka, a spokesman for the company, said by email that the refinery ""is working hand-in-hand with the state on a path forward.""
\
Hamakua Energy Partners, which burns naphtha, a petroleum product, said in its filing with the Health Department that the 16 percent emission requirement is ""unobtainable"" by the facility.
\
The company argues that its generators already operate at high efficiencies, that carbon capture technologies are not currently available or economically feasible, and that reducing production is not an option because of its contract with Hawaii Electric Light Co. and the importance of its energy production for Hawaii island.
\
The company's contract to supply power to HELCO, the Hawaii island utility, runs through 2030.
\
ACCORDING to its filing, Hamakua Energy Partners proposes an alternative plan: deep-cleaning its generators over the next two years, which could reduce emissions by up to 1 percent.
\
The company pegs the cost to the facility at $200,000. If the state goes ahead with plans to import natural gas, the company says, it would then evaluate switching to the cleaner-burning fuel.
\
Allen Hess, manager of the Hamakua plant, declined to comment on the filing.
\
Blue Planet's Mikulina said that Hamakua Energy Partners ignores other options for meeting the 16 percent emission reduction, such as using cleaner-burning biofuels, and said that in the larger picture, the island's ample geothermal resources could make the fossil fuel plant unnecessary.
\
The state rules also allow companies to work with one another to achieve the same overall emission reductions, similar to a ""cap and trade"" system.
\
Chevron, which announced last year that it was soliciting buyers for its Kapolei refinery and gas stations, is also seeking a revised emission requirement from state health officials. Instead of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at its facility by 16 percent, the company requests approval for a 2.2 percent reduction from 2009 levels, which it has already achieved, according to its filing.
\
Chevron argues that the refinery has actually decreased its greenhouse gas emissions by 7.3 percent since 1990.
\
The Health Department lacked facility-specific data on emission rates for 1990. So instead, officials used 2010 as a baseline for companies to make 16 percent emission reductions, which the department expects will achieve the state's overall mandate to reduce emissions to 1990 levels.
\
CHEVRON spokesman Al Chee said that there aren't any reduction measures that the company can take to reduce emissions that are technologically or economically feasible.
\
""We can't see anything more that we can do at this time, though we will continue to look at ways, as we always have, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Chee.
\
He said that the company had not looked into joining with another company to achieve the 16 percent reduction.
\
Hirai said that the Health Department doesn't have a deadline for approving the greenhouse gas emission plans. He said the department will begin measuring greenhouse gas emissions beginning in 2016 and every year thereafter to gauge Hawaii's progress in meeting the 2020 mandate.
\
While state officials move to implement Hawaii's greenhouse gas emissions law, the Obama administration finalized rules in its Clean Power Plan on Monday, which require a 32 percent reduction nationally in greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels.
\
Hawaii was one of four states that received a deferral from having to comply with specific federal requirements due in part to its geographic isolation, said Janet McCabe, an EPA assistant administrator, during a media conference call this week.
\
Hirai said that the state's own greenhouse gas laws and aggressive renewable energy targets, which require the electric utilities to convert to 100 percent renewable energy by 2045, will likely render the federal requirements moot.

CHICAGO » Republicans in Illinois hold no statewide offices, are minorities in both chambers of the state Legislature and struggle some years to recruit viable candidates even at the top of the ballot.
\
CAPTION: But the election last week of a long-shot Republican, Scott Brown, to the Senate in Massachusetts, a similarly blue state, has invigorated Republicans here. Next Tuesday's statewide primaries?the first in the nation this year?have suddenly turned into a pep rally for November and could provide a window into what is to come nationally as the 2010 primary season unfolds.
\
""Illinois is next,"" said Pat Brady, chairman of the state Republican Party. ""The political environment is worse here for Democrats than it was in Massachusetts.""
\
Rep. Mark Steven Kirk, the front-runner in the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate seat once held by President Barack Obama, has even taken to echoing Brown's campaign remarks. ""No one should make the mistake by calling this the Obama seat,"" he said in an interview. ""This is the seat of the people of Illinois.""
\
Democratic leaders here discount direct comparisons to Massachusetts?for starters, the race there was a special election, not a primary?and point out distinctions from this state's candidates, voting blocs and alliances. And perhaps most of all, they mention their sense that Illinois voters still carry a special allegiance to Obama.
\
Still, the message from Massachusetts is resounding among Democrats, too (in interviews, several candidates quickly proclaimed themselves ""outsiders""). The party is trying to hold onto the Senate seat, the governor's mansion and a few House seats that Republicans say they are especially confident about winning.
\
A televised forum last week among the three top Democrats in the Senate race seemed to become a scuffle over which one would be the least likely, come November, to lose in an upset similar to the one in Massachusetts. (Along the way, they struck notes that sounded not so unlike Brown.)
\
One candidate, Cheryle Jackson, who led the Chicago Urban League, said the Massachusetts vote had reflected the lack of jobs and the suffering of people?""precisely,"" she added, ""the reason I have decided to run.""
\
And another candidate, David Hoffman, a former inspector-general for the city of Chicago, offered this pitch for himself as a way to dodge a Massachusetts outcome: ""We need to make sure that we have a nominee who is as independent as possible.""
\
Some argue that Kirk, as a five-term congressman and a moderate Republican with centrist-leaning views that have irked conservatives, may not benefit from voter unrest. (Democrats also have their eyes on his House district in Chicago's northern suburbs.)
\
""In a key way, Illinois is Massachusetts in reverse,"" said Kathleen Strand, a senior adviser to Illinois for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ""Here, the Republican candidate is the Washington insider that voters are angry at, not the Democrat.""
\
In the view of some conservatives, Kirk, who supports abortions rights, fits right in with the Democratic candidates. They say that while he might gain unhappy Democratic voters and center-leaning independents, he will lose the votes of a different segment?some who consider themselves part of the Tea Party movement, anti-abortion advocates and others.
\
Conservatives often cite Kirk's vote in favor of cap-and-trade legislation intended to reduce carbon emissions; he has since reversed course, criticizing the legislation and saying he would vote against it as a senator. They also do not appreciate what they see as his effort to swerve to the right; some mocked his campaign for trying to win supportive words from former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska when she was in Chicago recently.
\
""Mark Kirk has absolutely no Tea Party support,"" said Diane Benjamin, an organizer of a Tea Party group in McLean County, about 90 miles southwest of Chicago.
\
In the primary, there are several lesser-known candidates, including Patrick Hughes, who has drawn praise from some conservatives and Tea Party supporters (though not Ms. Benjamin). But analysts say that opposition to Kirk has not amounted to a movement unified and motivated enough to defeat him; a Chicago Tribune poll released on Monday showed Kirk with a wide lead in the primary race. (Of those Republicans polled who said they agreed with the Tea Party movement, 48 percent favored Kirk, the newspaper said.)

5,"Winds of changeObama participation at climate talks brings hope for unity, resolve\When President Obama participates in the Copenhagen negotiations this week to draft a new agreement on global climate change, he will become the first American president to personally attend key climate negotiations.\The president's announcement that he will attend the Copenhagen meeting has already had a positive impact. World leaders who were previously reluctant to go, such as the prime ministers of China and Canada, have announced that they too will participate.\Obama recently announced that the United States will set a goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent from their 2005 level by the year 2020. This number is consistent with a bill already passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, and is in the ballpark of legislation being considered by the Senate.\This proposed decrease should not be very difficult to achieve. Most of the reductions could come simply from the more fuel-efficient automobiles that Detroit is beginning to produce, and from more efficient energy use in industry, households and commercial buildings. These are measures that we need to take anyway, to enhance national security by reducing the demand for imported oil, and to save money in economically tough times. We do not need to adopt a controversial scheme such as ""cap and trade"" to achieve this goal.\While the U.S. as a whole will benefit from using energy more efficiently, a few industries may see a decline in the demand for their products. Among these would be coal producers, oil refiners and gas station owners. Some of them have lobbied hard against any climate agreement, and will continue to put pressure on the Senate not to ratify any treaty.\Options to address these concerns include creating new ""green"" jobs in coal-producing states, providing incentives for refiners to export more of their products, and facilitating the transition of ""gas"" stations to ""gas and recharging"" stations for the new generation of electric vehicles that are likely to become increasingly popular as a way of reducing emissions. O'ahu, with its compact size and high population density, could be a leader in this area.\Major developing countries such as China and India have for many years made setting any emission goals contingent on the United States setting its own targets to substantially lower emissions. Many of them are likely to be disappointed at the president's announcement of a modest 17 percent reduction by 2020. This target implies that each American would still emit about twice as much carbon dioxide as each Frenchman, German or Japanese, who have roughly the same standard of living as we do. The president did announce a larger reduction target of 83 percent by 2050, but the scientific community would like to see this achieved sooner.\Each American emits about four times as much carbon dioxide as each person in China, and about 15 times as much as each Indian. Hundreds of millions of people in those countries still live in poverty, although both countries have gone a long way in reducing the gap between the haves and the have-nots. It would be unrealistic to expect them to start reducing their absolute emissions until a much larger share of the population breaks the poverty barrier.\Shortly after Obama's announcement of the U.S. emissions target for 2020, China announced that by the same year it would reduce its carbon intensity (the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of economic output) by 40 to 45 percent compared to 2005. India has also offered to substantially reduce its emission intensity.\President Obama's participation in the Copenhagen climate summit is being welcomed around the world as an indication that the U.S. is finally willing to take action against this common threat and to revitalize a conference that many had until recently written off as unlikely to produce a breakthrough. Even though a final agreement has been postponed until 2010, the chances for consensus on the way forward are much better than they were just a few weeks ago.\Toufiq Siddiqi is president of Global Environment and Energy in the 21st Century and an adjunct senior fellow at the East-West Center. He was a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore. He wrote this commentary for The Advertiser."
6,"PUBLIC WORKERS\More than 5% of state's population\Are public workers really taking a disproportionate hit? We have more than 70,000 state employees, which exceeds 5 percent of the Hawai'i population.\By comparison, the Census Bureau says the number of public workers in the other states, including debt-ridden California, is less than 2 percent of population.\I wonder why the Legislature can't find the root of our budget problem?\PAUL MILLER | Kane'ohe\GOV. MARK SANFORD\Better monitoring needed at airports\Who was watching the store or, better yet, the door?\Here we have a governor from South Carolina, surely highly visible, able to depart the country for a foreign country, be gone for four days and then return unannounced.\Where was the TSA, where was immigration?\Are there no watch lists or alerts posted at the airlines and ports for such instances?\Maybe they were too busy watching the borders for all those illegals wanting to work at all those low-paying jobs we have to offer - makes you wonder.\JOHN RUPERT | Honolulu\FURLOUGHS\Cutting library hours hurts users\I am at one of Manoa Library's computers and conveying my utterly abysmal feeling on Hawai'i's furlough situation.\I stopped by the reference desk and asked how a three-day furlough situation would affect the libraries here in Hawai'i. The answer was: ""Still to be determined,"" and ""check with your legislator.""\I feel that if library hours were cut three days each month, it would be an abysmal, terrible situation for library users like me.\I hope and pray that through arbitration/mediation and meeting halfway, a suitable compromise will be reached and we won't have three-day furloughs in place here during this recessionary 2009 year in beautiful, wonderful Hawai'i, so as many library hours can be saved for the library users like me, especially the children/students here.\FRANKIE KAM | Honolulu\More time should be spent negotiating\Whatever happened to bargaining in good faith?\Our governor has shown no respect in her dealings with government workers and sets a very poor example for employer/employee relations in her single-solution plan to solve the state's financial situation. Her attitude toward her employees and subsequent spin is insulting at the least.\I am sure that by now she certainly would have realized some union concessions had she been transparent and fair in her political and media posturing at the onset, and come up with a more far-sighted and comprehensive plan.\Her actions were a poor excuse for a Hail Mary; more time at the bargaining table and less time in front of the cameras would have us all in a much better place right now.\MJ CULVYHOUSE | Kane'ohe\TAXES\Excise tax differs from sales tax\Natalia Lugani (Letters, June 24) compares ""our tax"" to California's (and other states') sales tax and reasons that ""raising the excise tax by 1 or 2 percent seems justified."" Comparing an excise tax to a sales tax is like comparing apples to oranges. By its very nature, an excise tax is already higher in tax burden than its equivalent sales tax.\It is this convoluted thinking that makes it so easy for politicians to raise taxes.\And by the way, ""our tax"" on O'ahu is 4.5 versus 4 percent to pay for the rail system (and since it is an excise tax, is the equivalent of probably 7 or 8 percent sales tax).\R.D. GREENAMYER | Mililani\LEEWARD BEACHESPassion for being green simply not evident\I spent most of the day on Thursday and early Friday trying to reach my representatives and find out their position on the ""cap and trade"" bill that was to be voted on Friday.\While many calls were made, neither representative's office could give an answer, saying Abercrombie and Hirono were still formulating their opinion. Really? No one in their respective offices could give a figure, either, as to how much it would cost us here in the Islands.\I must say it came as no surprise that they voted lock-step in the affirmative.\What truly bothers me is the hypocrisy of their so-called cry for the environment, yet every day I pass by tent cities where there are no sanitation facilities, rubbish piled everywhere blowing all around, and vehicles in various stages of repair with oil all over the ground. Where is the outrage from the environmentalists on that blight? Can those beaches be used and enjoyed by the public? No. It is disingenuous to cry green on one hand while turning a blind eye to the mess that has become our beaches on the Leeward Coast.\MELISSA LAUER | Wai'anae"
7,"HEALTH CARE\War gets billions while care lags\Despite the U.S. spending $1 trillion on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the expected $2 trillion to ""repay war debt, replenish military equipment and provide care and treatment for U.S. veterans back home"" (Advertiser, Focus section, July 5), people who support these campaigns have a reasonable argument that one can't put a value on national security.\The same principle applies - as much, if not more so - to national health. Would we allow 47 million Americans to be left vulnerable to attacks by terrorists? Of course not. Then how can people, many of them the same politicians and pundits from both parties, argue for leaving more than 10 percent of the population vulnerable to the vagaries of our health care system?\One of the main arguments against it is cost. Even the high-end price tag of $1.6 trillion over 10 years (since reduced to around $600 billion) looks relatively affordable when placed next to our past and future war spending.\The benefits accrued by a national health system are vast. Increased competition in the marketplace will lead to greater access and efficiency in the health care industry and lower costs for everyone. If only the same could be said for the wars.\JOHN CHEEVER | Honolulu\FURLOUGHS\Burden for public workers must be fair\I am a state worker, a member of the Hawaii Government Employees Association. I understand the resentment of the private sector toward public workers, as we have not yet felt the impact on our wages of the current economic downturn that the private sector has been experiencing for a considerable length of time.\Many members of the public sector understand the gravity of what has occurred in the private sector and we fully empathize with those whose jobs have been lost or wages cut.\We also understand that we cannot emerge unscathed from this financial turmoil.\Our concern had been that the three days of furlough a month initially announced by the governor was too much of a burden for public workers. It would have meant an almost 15 percent loss in pay, accompanied by the approximately 25 percent increase in their share of health insurance that all public workers are slated to absorb, beginning this month.\State workers are historically not paid well, and this double financial ""hit"" would have been excessive for many of us.\Most public workers are hoping for an agreement that finds a middle ground: one in which state workers assume their fair share of the current economic burden, but are not pushed toward financial ruin because of it.\NANCY KERN | Honolulu\FIREWORKS\Mahalo for terrific Hawai'i Kai show\I can't speak for the Ala Moana fireworks, but the spectacular show at Maunalua Bay in Hawai'i Kai was the best I've ever seen in Hawai'i. I don't know who underwrote the cost, but a giant mahalo from the thousands of people whose eyes lit up for well over 20 minutes on Saturday night. Not to mention not having to drive into town.\CLIFF MARSH | Hawai'i Kai\CONSERVATION\Too much water waste going on\For every person who cares about conservation and the environment, there seems to be 10 who don't. On my workouts around Maka- kilo, I come across people who still hose down their driveways, wash the sidewalks and even power-wash them. Are they ignorant, apathetic? I do know they just don't care about our water shortages and drought conditions.\To make things worse, they wash leaves and other debris down the storm drains. And I could even start ranting about those who use their blowers to push rubbish into the storm drains leading to one reason why the drainage system gets clogged. And they get so indignant when one questions their actions. Auwe!\ROBIN CHING | Kapolei\INOUYE\Ethical lapse aside, consider legislation\I've always been fond of Sen. Inouye. We first met in 1962 when my Boy Scout group visited the Capitol.\But using his enormous influence as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee to rescue his investment in Central Pacific Bank was clearly unethical by any reasonable standard of behavior. Inouye's ethical lapse was further amplified by his silly excuse that would have us believe that ""only a phone call"" to the FDIC from his office wouldn't spur the outcome he sought.\Yet, in the context of what passes for ethics in Congress these days, my approbation for Dan's use of his influence to save himself a half-million dollars is limited. I'm much more concerned about the federal budget deficit (quadrupled already this year), the ridiculously expensive House-passed ""cap and trade"" energy bill and ""health reform"" legislation under consideration, the last of which will result in more expensive, slower and lower-quality care for most here in Hawai'i.\So, it's my hope that as Sen. Inouye ponders his recent ethical lapse, he won't be so tone-deaf when it comes to how harmful such pending legislation will be to us back home.\MICHAEL P. RETHMAN | Kane'ohe"
8,"Furloughs\Teachers already work for free\By asking teachers to volunteer for the remaining furlough days this school year, it appears Gov. Lingle is trying to make herself look good and educators look bad. Not that teachers don't already ""volunteer"" time and money. They do. But I know many teachers who are forced to work a second job on furlough days just to make ends meet.\One younger teacher told me that towards the end of each pay period, she has about $4 left and has to eat canned food from the cupboard. Of course this same teacher has spent her own money to feed breakfast to the students in her book club which meets weekly at 7:15 a.m. She tutors to make up some of the loss of income.\Of course we believe education is a priority -- and yes, of course we don't want our students to miss out; so treat us like professionals.\People wouldn't expect a service provider like a plumber or a bus driver to work without pay. Why put educators on the spot? The governor should be fair and fund education. If it truly is a priority, then use the funds to end furlough Fridays.\inga park Okean | Honolulu\citizenship\Thanks for noting student awardees\Mahalo nui loa to those 42 citizenship awardees from public high schools noted in The Advertiser supplement (Sixth Annual Citizenship Awards, April 28). These student awardees inspire us with their unselfishness and the way they put others first. Their actions will make our world a better place. Congratulations to their teachers, their family members, and their mentors who helped them along the way.\I commend you and your corporate sponsors for taking the time to celebrate the accomplishments of these incredible students. Acknowledging and recognizing the good that surrounds us is a beacon for others to follow and reinforces the positive things that bind us together.\colin kippen | Executive director, Native Hawaiian Education Council\hanson column\Staub's rebuttal was well-articulated\Thank you for running the commentary from H. Gerald Staub (""Iraq war hardly the success some claim,"" April 27). Victor Davis Hanson's April 15 commentary made my blood boil but I could not articulate my thoughts as well as Staub did.\My final comment for Hanson concerns his pride over the fact that the number of American soldiers lost in the first three months of 2010 is ""only"" equal to the number of murder victims in Fresno, Calif.\I hope Hanson has already planned his tour of the country to visit each of these soldier's families and tell them how good they should feel about this fact.\vicki vitallo | Kailua\special election\Don't waste vote on conservative Djou\Charles Djou appears to be running a highly contradictory and stealth campaign for Congress, and he may very well win by doing so.\He says he is against the stimulus package, but wants federal money and projects coming to Hawaii; he is against the bailouts, but wants a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution (which, if it had been in place in 2008 would have led to the second great Depression); he's against cap and trade but somehow in favor of the environment!\He's against the health care package, but wants to privatize all medical insurance, which will surely drive up costs; he's for traditional marriage and fairness but against civil unions, the ultimate act of fairness.\In short, he will be just another right-wing clone voting in lockstep with the just-say-no conservatives. Djou is just another reactionary disguised as an independent who will surely be voted out come November. Why waste your vote on Djou?\john jaeger | Honolulu\hurricane fund\Spend the money where it's needed\Barbara Cook's letter (April 26) regarding the use of hurricane relief funds to make for more campers at the governor's office after the next hurricane is typical of the misunderstood fund.\Check the statute. This money cannot be used to help a single home or condo owner, state or county building, or insurance company after the next storm. Legally, it is maybe for the hurricane after next. Even then it is only a possibility of being needed because it is for the next group of state hurricane insurance policyholders, but only if that is needed.\The current money should be deployed for something useful. The only thing really bothersome is that neither the Legislature nor the administration have used part of the fund or interest to help those entities who will be directly involved with the next hurricane: state and county civil defense agencies and the Hawaii chapter of the American Red Cross. And then there are the home and condo owners who really could use some help to prepare their properties with loss-mitigation grants or tax credits.\Frankly, the fund has provided $6 million to $8 million a year to the general fund from the earned interest for a decade. It's just a money pool. The name is irrelevant.\GERALD PETERS | Kailua\civil unions\Don't vote for those who voted for 444\Have you noticed that most of our local politicians are attorneys, too? And most favor civil unions since they consider it a civil rights issue?\It's not an easy job being a lawmaker in these times when jobs, ending public school furloughs and working on our state deficit are top priorities.\However, money is not the only issue, since proponents of the civil unions bill continued to push to get this passed before the Legislature recessed yesterday.\Now some Protestant pastors and even non-attorneys will say that this is not about ""marriage,"" but the wording in the bill conveys the same rights, duties and privileges as contained under HRS 572 which happens to be the Hawaii law governing marriage. So how you figgah?\To me, marriage is the basis of our society, and it is a relationship between a man and woman only.\I will not vote for incumbents in the special and general elections who vote for the civil unions bill; and I ask you readers for your support. Let the silent majority rise up and be heard.\donald mack | 'Aiea\misled by gop\U.S. has paid dearly for Iraq invasion\In 2003, Charles Djou's Republican Party convinced Congress, under false pretenses, that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which necessitated an invasion. United Nations' and American weapons inspectors quickly proved that President Bush and Vice President Cheney lied to the American people.\From the start of the war in 2003 until today, American taxpayers have spent $10 billion monthly, totaling $900 billion. The cost of waging this unnecessary war does not include the thousands of young Americans who have been killed or severely wounded.\As for Ed Case, he voted with the Republicans to invade Iraq against the wise counsel and advice of our esteemed senators, Dan Inouye and Dan Akaka. He exercised extremely bad judgment while serving the first time. He should not be given a second chance.\T. george paris | Waipahu"
9,"
RICHMOND, Va. >> For nearly a year, Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, Virginia's crusading Republican attorney general, has waged a one-man war on the theory of man-made global warming.
\
Invoking his subpoena powers, he has sought to force the University of Virginia to turn over the files of a prominent climatology professor, asserting that his research may be marred by fraud. The university is battling the move in the courts.
\
At the same time, Cuccinelli is suing the Environmental Protection Agency over its ruling that carbon dioxide and other global warming gases pose a threat to human health and welfare, describing the science behind the agency's decision as ""unreliable, unverifiable and doctored.""
\
Now his allegations of manipulated data and scientific fraud are resonating in Congress, where Republican leaders face an influx of new members, many of them Tea Party stalwarts like Cuccinelli, eager to inveigh against the body of research linking man-made emissions to warming.
\
""There's a huge appetite among the rank-and-file to raise fundamental questions about the underlying science,"" said Michael McKenna, a Republican strategist and energy lobbyist.
\
Responding to those concerns, the new Republican majority has introduced legislation that would strip federal regulators of their power to police the industrial emissions that contribute to climate change. But party leaders, treading warily, have cast their arguments against regulation largely in terms of economic consequences, playing down the prospect of major hearings to examine the scientific basis of human-caused warming.
\
Even dedicated opponents of climate action concede that hauling climate scientists before Congress and challenging their findings could easily backfire, as many representatives lack a sophisticated grasp of climatology and run the risk of making embarrassing errors.
\
""It's a trap for a lot of members,"" said Marc Morano, a former Republican staff member on the Senate Environment and Public Works committee and publisher of Climate Depot, a website that advances the arguments of climate skeptics. ""They're apt to make mistakes.""
\
Meanwhile, a planned investigation by Rep. Darrell Issa of California into alleged instances of manipulation and fraud by climate scientists -- broadly similar to those cited by Cuccinelli in his legal complaints -- has been indefinitely postponed.
\
Yet as the Republican leadership puts the brakes on a climate science confrontation, Cuccinelli has forged ahead.
\
In the process, his critics say, he has not only made mistakes, but also twisted facts to bolster his case against the climatologist, Michael E. Mann, now a professor at Pennsylvania State University.
\
Sherwood L. Boehlert, a retired Republican congressman from New York and a former chairman of the House Science Committee, is among those who have sharply criticized Cuccinelli's tactics.
\
""I find no logical explanation for spending taxpayer dollars on this politically designed, headline-grabbing pursuit of his,"" said Boehlert, whose panel in 2006 investigated nearly identical charges by climate skeptics that Mann had falsified results but found no evidence of wrongdoing.
\
More than 800 professors and scientists in Virginia have petitioned the attorney general to abandon his pursuit of Mann. As the university fights the investigation, a state judge has ruled substantially in its favor although a final decision has yet to be made.
\
The case has also been divisive in Virginia politics, with the Democrat-controlled State Senate voting on Feb. 3 to strip Cuccinelli of the power to investigate future instances of academic fraud at public universities. The following week, senators passed a budget amendment requiring the attorney general to keep detailed expense records on projects that exceed 100 work hours -- a proposal aimed at forcing Cuccinelli to open the books on his investigation of Mann.
\
Both measures passed easily and with the support of Republicans, including the Senate minority leader, though neither is expected to clear the Republican-held State House.
\
Cuccinelli seems unfazed by the backlash. ""We'll see the documents,"" he said confidently in an interview in his Richmond office, referring to Mann's e-mails and computer files.
\
Although cast by his foes as an angry ideologue, Cuccinelli, 42, was amiable and upbeat in discussing the litigation. He ruefully acknowledged the backlash against his investigation of Mann. ""I can tell you that out of all the things we've done in this first year in office, none has attracted more vitriolic assault,"" he said.
\
He described the inquiry as a legitimate function of his office. ""I would expect any attorney general sitting in this chair to do the same thing,"" he said.
\
Cuccinelli's conservative views make him no stranger to controversy. Before his election as attorney general in November 2009, he served nearly eight years in the State Senate, where he was known for his hard-right stances on illegal immigration, same-sex marriage, gun control and abortion and for clashing with moderates within his party.
\
Shortly after taking office in January 2010, he sued the Obama administration over the health care overhaul, which Cuccinelli called unconstitutional. A federal judge ruled partly in his favor, catapulting him into the national spotlight, although the decision was quickly appealed.
\
On climate change, Cuccinelli said he had begun to pay serious attention to the issue only recently, after momentum began to grow behind legislation to establish a national cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gases. He did ""basic reading,"" he said, and became convinced that scientific proof linking industrial emissions to warming was lacking.
\
His doubts deepened in late 2009, he said, when a large cache of e-mails between scientists from the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia, in Britain, were illicitly published online.
\
Climate change skeptics seized on the e-mails as proof that the science linking man-made emissions to warming was doctored and exaggerated, and skeptical bloggers dubbed the episode Climategate. Multiple investigations, including one by the British House of Lords, cleared the researchers involved of scientific wrongdoing.
\
Despite those conclusions, Cuccinelli asserted in the interview and in response to written questions that the contents of the leaked e-mails indicated a conspiracy among top scientists to exaggerate carbon dioxide's effect on global temperatures. ""They suggest knowledgeable deception on the part of a number of folks,"" he said.
\
""It's when you introduce the evidence of some people being deceptive that you have the basis for the concerns about our state tax dollars and state institutions being misused,"" he said. ""It doesn't happen without the Climategate e-mails.""
\
Cuccinelli maintains that he is merely investigating potential financial abuses, not challenging Mann's scientific conclusions. But the state's legal briefs in the case are at their essence a critical assessment of Mann's research, which has centered on the historical reconstruction of global temperatures.
\
And even prominent climate skeptics challenge the attorney general's contention that he is not pursuing the climatologist over his scientific work. At a May 2010 conference bringing together leading skeptical researchers, for instance, Stephen McIntyre, a retired Canadian mining engineer and amateur statistician whose critical analysis of Mann's research and demands for data from British scientists were at the heart of the e-mail scandal, denounced the Virginia inquiry.
\
""I strongly disagree with Cuccinelli's recent investigation of potential financial abuse,"" McIntyre said. ""Regardless of what one may think of the quality of Mann's work, he has published diligently.""
\
The investigation has also run into legal hurdles, with a state judge hearing the case questioning the strength of evidence against Mann.
\
""The nature of the conduct is not stated so that any reasonable person could glean what Dr. Mann did to violate the statute,"" Judge Paul M. Peatross Jr. wrote in an August ruling. The judge did not dismiss the case, however, allowing the state to amend and refile its subpoena.
\
Climate experts also sharply question claims of fraud cited in Cuccinelli's lawsuit against the EPA.
\
Most notably, citing an independent 2009 report, the State of Virginia's complaint asserts that climate scientists at the University of East Anglia, the source of the leaked emails -- doctored Russian temperature data to exaggerate warming. Because the Climate Research Unit provides basic temperature data to scientists around the world, any corruption of the data seriously undermines the theory of man-made warming, the suit argues.
\
Yet Alexander Bedritskiy, president of the World Meteorological Organization and the top climate change adviser to President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia, said that the Russian report was thoroughly discredited by top scientists in his country more than a year ago.
\
""Any scientific discussion on the results, pretending to be science-based, does not make sense,"" Bedritskiy said in an e-mail.
\
He also noted that the author of that report, Andrei Illarionov, is not a climate scientist but an economist with the Cato Institute, a conservative research group in the United States.
\
Cuccinelli could not say how he had verified the accuracy of the report, which is written in Russian, but said that his legal complaint had been ""heavily researched."" The research did not consist of consultations with scientists, however, he said.
\
""We have to have a certain understanding of our context to operate, but that doesn't require expert witnesses,"" he said.
\
The EPA lawsuit, with dozens of co-plaintiffs and the full force of the federal government opposing it, is expected to result in a highly complex court battle potentially spanning several years -- a prospect Cuccinelli appears to relish.
\
A wide range of legal experts said the suit had a low chance of success. ""It's the legal equivalent of the 'Hail Mary' pass,"" said Michael B. Gerrard, a professor at Columbia Law School and an authority on climate change law.
\
Political experts further questioned whether another drawn-out battle on climate change science will appeal much to voters.
\
""There is a significant portion of the Virginia public that sees these issues as distractions from what the attorney general should be focusing on,"" said Mark J. Rozell, a professor of political science at George Mason University.
\
""There are many people who are deeply uncomfortable with the crusader-type style that he is cultivating,"" he said.

10,"Obama, Clinton woo Hawai'i Democrats\Democratic presidential nomination campaign continues to be close\U.S. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton said yesterday that she recognizes the importance of U.S. Sen. Barack Obama's ties to Hawai'i but asked voters at the Democratic caucuses tonight to look deeper into their public-policy positions.\Clinton released a detailed explanation last week of how her national proposals on healthcare, education and the environment might benefit Hawai'i, while Obama has spoken more broadly about how his inspirational vision for the country can bring people together. Obama, who was born here and graduated from Punahou School, has also been asked more personal questions about his background in Hawai'i during local news media interviews.\""I think people want both,"" Clinton told The Advertiser by phone from Wisconsin, which holds a primary today. ""They want to believe in their country again. They want to be proud of America. They want a leader who can really call us to a greater cause that will bring us together. But they don't want to be fooled, and they don't want to wake up and find out that all they've got are words.\""There's a big difference between speeches and solutions, talk and action. I think actions speak louder than words. And if you want to know what someone will do in the future, it's often wise to look and see what they've done in the past.""\U.S. Rep. Neil Abercrombie, D-Hawai'i, who is campaigning for Obama, said he doubted what he described as slight differences on policy would influence many caucusgoers.\""They want to know who is the most electable,"" the congressman said. ""I think, by the end of tomorrow night's caucuses, they will have chosen Barack Obama on the basis that he can carry the Democratic Party banner in a united way.""\'ONE STEP CLOSER'\Obama, who was also in Wisconsin yesterday, spoke by telephone conference call to his Hawai'i volunteers.\""Just over a year ago, when I was there in Hawai'i, I decided to run for president. And on Tuesday, I know the people of Hawai'i will get me one step closer,"" he said.\Obama said victories in Wisconsin and Hawai'i today would give him 10 in a row heading into the March 4 contests in Ohio and Texas, which the Clinton campaign have identified as critical to stopping Obama's momentum. Obama said a victory in either Ohio or Texas would mean ""we're going to be able to make a pretty strong claim to going ahead and bringing this nomination process to a close.\""So we are on the brink of victory here, people, but we've just got to push very, very hard.""\The Obama campaign also launched automated telephone calls in Hawai'i yesterday with a recorded message from Obama urging voters to participate in the caucuses.\His sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng, a history teacher at La Pietra Hawai'i School for Girls, led an afternoon rally at Farrington High School. ""He helped me to be a better version of myself and he is going to help us to be a better version of ourselves as a nation collectively,"" she said. ""He is going to help us to strive a little more, to reach a little higher.""\The Clinton campaign, meanwhile, put out automated telephone calls Sunday from Chelsea Clinton thanking people in the Islands for their hospitality during her three-day campaign visit.\U.S. Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawai'i, and his fiancee, Irene Hirano, joined Clinton volunteers at party headquarters yesterday afternoon to phone bank. The senator said he would not have returned from Washington, D.C., for the caucuses - the first time in about 40 years that he has participated - if he were not serious about Clinton.\""Every vote counts,"" said Inouye, who nailed down two Clinton votes in the first few numbers dialed. ""And I think people should be convinced that every vote counts. And that's why I'm hoping they'll all turn out.""\DRAWING DISTINCTIONS\Clinton, D-N.Y., said there are some important policy differences between her and Obama. She said her universal healthcare plan would cover everyone, while Obama's healthcare plan would not. Clinton's healthcare proposal is similar to Hawai'i's landmark Prepaid Health Care Act of 1974, which requires businesses to provide health insurance to employees who work more than 20 hours a week. Clinton would also offer tax credits to people and small businesses to offset the cost of insurance premiums and of offering healthcare plans to workers.\Obama, D-Ill., would create a national health insurance exchange to help people buy private insurance and to serve as a watchdog to help monitor insurance plans for fairness and accessibility. Businesses that do not provide adequate coverage to workers would have to contribute a portion of payroll to help pay for the national plan, although smaller businesses would be exempt. He would also require that all children have health insurance coverage.\Clinton has also proposed a moratorium on home foreclosures and a freeze on interest rates in response to the crisis in the mortgage lending market.\She also has an alternative energy plan that would fund research into solar, tidal and wave power that could help reduce Hawai'i's dependence on oil.\Obama has proposed an industry cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, investment in what he described as ""climate friendly"" energy supplies, and a new international partnership on global warming.\""I know ties to the community are important,"" Clinton said of Obama's Hawai'i roots. ""I value my relationships in the state based on the work that I've done and the visits that I've made there. But I also think it's important to have a clear vision for what we want to do to help Hawai'i and our nation to achieve.""\CLOSER THAN EXPECTED\The nomination campaign, which many political analysts had thought would be over by Super Tuesday, is close because many Democrats see strengths in both Obama and Clinton.\Mike Schultz, who is studying political science at the University of Hawai'i-Manoa and lives in 'iea, said he had been undecided until last month.\""I was actually on the fence for a long time. But about a month ago I decided that Clinton would probably be the best candidate for a couple reasons. I was a big fan of Bill, and she has a lot of experience,"" he said. ""I honestly believe that she is our best chance against (Republican front-runner John) McCain and for having another Democrat in the presidency.""\Chris Ballesteros, the student body president at Damien Memorial School who will vote for president for the first time this year, described Obama as a break from the traditional mold of candidates.\""What I've noticed is that Sen. Obama does tend to stray away from the specifics when he gives his speeches, and that's part of his magic,"" said Ballesteros, who wants to run for president himself one day. ""He's more easily able to influence people when he's speaking when he stays in the abstract, in the ideal. But if you look at the statements he's released, if you look at his Web site, if you look at the details he provides in his folders and his fliers, he does nail down the specific policy issues.\""I think the problem with what Sen. Clinton has been doing is that she has not had the same charismatic appeal because she tries to deal with the specifics and the details in her speeches, and that's what hurts her charisma and her inspirational ability.""\Reach Derrick DePledge at dde pledge@honoluluadvertiser.com or at 525-8070.\Drop-in:\WHO CAN VOTE\People must be registered voters and members of the Democratic Party to participate, but can register and sign up on caucus night.

11,"Barrel tax crucial for cleaner Hawai'iBut only if money is spent on programs to help environment\Thirty-five days. That -- according to the 2009 Hawaiian Electric Industries annual report -- is the length of time before Hawai'i's electricity shuts off should something disrupt the flow of oil to our Islands. It's the length of time between comfort and chaos.\If Hawai'i hopes to free itself from this dangerous addiction to imported fuel, we'll need to commit to changing how we produce and use energy. It makes sense to tap the source of our problem, imported oil, to fund our solutions: clean energy and energy efficiency.\Lawmakers are currently considering House Bill 2421, a policy that would tack a $1.50 tax per barrel on most imported oil products. This could generate roughly $40 million annually for clean energy programs at a monthly cost to residents that's equivalent to a Starbucks grande coffee. It's less than four cents additional on each gallon of gas. But those pennies would make a down payment on our clean energy future, something that will pay dividends to every resident and business.\This idea of a ""carbon tax"" to support clean energy has support among experts and residents alike. In a Washington Post interview last month, U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, said, ""I absolutely believe a price on carbon is essential."" According to two statewide surveys conducted for our organization, 70 percent of residents would be willing to pay a $3 barrel tax if the money was used to wean Hawai'i from oil.\The success of the policy, however, rests on lawmakers' ability to resist the urge to reroute the revenue to the general fund. The funds from the carbon tax must be used to wean Hawai'i from oil. While other programs are certainly worthwhile, reducing oil's burden on our economy simply makes everything else more affordable. So where should we put the oil tax revenue to work?\The first place is energy efficiency. It's the quickest and most effective way to lower residents' and businesses' energy bills. Fortunately, we have established programs, such as the solar rebate program, that can be vastly expanded with new revenue.\Here's the magic: Efficiency allows us to leverage a massive return on investment. Consider Blue Planet Foundation's Moloka'i project to replace every incandescent bulb on the island with energy efficient alternatives. Over the life of the program, every dollar invested in new bulbs will prevent about $200 from being spent on electricity. One dollar down, $200 back -- those are returns that would make Bernie Madoff green. We can keep more money in our economy if we spend less on purchasing oil from overseas.\Second, we need to fund the essential planning and development of Hawai'i's clean energy future. The 40 positions in the state energy office, however, are almost solely funded by limited federal funding source, sources soon to expire. Gov. Linda Lingle has made clean energy a hallmark of her administration, but this legacy won't last without a dedicated source of funding for navigating this multibillion-dollar transition.\Not all taxes are created equal. The oil tax is smart tax-shifting policy that puts a price on things we don't want (like pollution) and pays for things we do want (like local jobs in the clean energy industry). Unlike most other taxes, residents can easily offset the barrel tax: a few compact fluorescent bulbs and keeping the car's tires properly inflated will offset any additional cost.\Our energy strategy for the past half century -- rolling the dice on the availability of cheap oil -- is a gamble that just doesn't work in an era of changing economies, changing world order, and a changing climate. While passing a carbon tax takes political courage, doing nothing leaves us with only 35 days of comfort.\Jeff Mikulina is executive director of the Blue Planet Foundation in Honolulu."
12," State lawmakers are normally cautious about raising taxes in an election year, but 2020 could be the exception. \ An array of proposed tax increases are still on the table at the midpoint of this year’s 60-day legislative session, including a bill to significantly increase the state income tax on Hawaii’s wealthiest residents to collect an extra $61 million a year. \ On the other end of the wealth spectrum, lawmakers have proposed a package of tax changes to help “working families” that may have some populist appeal, including a new refundable earned income tax credit to help the working poor, and a plan to increase a tax credit for lower-income families to offset the impact of the state’s excise tax on food. \ It’s too early to tell which of those proposals might emerge from the legislative scrum when the session ends in May, but fears about the impact of the coronavirus scare on the state economy may make lawmakers extra cautious about adopting any proposals that would decrease state tax collections. \ University of Hawaii economics professor emeritus James Mak noted in a blog post last week that lawmakers are debating general excise tax credits for various groups this year, and wondered: “With the coronavirus posing a potentially serious threat to the state’s economy, is this a good time to contract the GET base further with the proposed tax breaks?” \ But the proposed tax increases may be a different story. Tax Foundation of Hawaii President Tom Yamachika, who has years of experience tracking bills through the state Capitol, said bills to boost taxes usually originate in the Senate and are killed in the House, whose members must stand for re-election every two years. \ This year, some of the major tax bills originated in the House, “which is a little bit concerning,” Yamachika said. \ A prime example is the proposed income tax increase for Hawaii residents with the highest incomes. House Bill 2385, introduced by House Speaker Scott Saiki, would increase the top state income tax rates from 11% today to 12% or 13% for the highest earners. \ During floor debate last week, House Finance Chairwoman Sylvia Luke said the bill is about “the taxing of the very rich.” The proposed new higher tax brackets would apply only to joint filers with taxable incomes of more than $500,000 a year, and to people who file as heads of households with taxable incomes of more than $375,000. \ However, the bill would also increase state income taxes by more modest amounts for single filers who have taxable incomes of more than $100,000, and for joint filers who have taxable incomes of more than $200,000. The new rates would take effect Jan. 1. \ “It’s never a good time to deal with tax changes,” said Luke, who described the bill in technical terms. The state needs to adopt new income tax brackets because there are quite a few brackets at the lower income levels, but not nearly as many for high-income taxpayers, she said. \ The bill was approved by the state House last week, with Reps. Lynn DeCoite, Sharon Har, Sam Kong, Lauren Matsumoto, Bob McDermott, Val Okimoto, Calvin Say, Cynthia Thielen, James Tokioka and Gene Ward voting against it, and Rep. Richard Creagan absent. \ The Tax Foundation warned that a higher income tax burden would encourage residents to leave Hawaii. “To what lengths will we go to chase people out of our state?” he said in written testimony. \ “We recommend that lawmakers think long and hard before further raising the income tax rates that have put Hawaii on the map for the wrong reasons,” the Tax Foundation said in its testimony. “This bill, if enacted, will reinforce the image that Hawaii is a poor place to live, work and invest, underscoring the poor business climate.” \ Yamachika said the foundation is “much more comfortable” with Senate Bill 3124, which would eliminate state income tax entirely for people who have less than $12,000 in taxable income, while increasing tax rates for middle-income taxpayers. \ INCREASED RATES \ The Senate bill would increase rates for single and married taxpayers filing jointly with taxable income of more than $48,000, and for heads of households with taxable incomes greater than $54,000. It would not increase the tax rates on the top earners in the state. \ That bill passed the state Senate unanimously last week, and Yamachika said it would not raise any additional money for the state. \ “In my opinion, we really shouldn’t be going after the people on the lowest end of the income spectrum,” Yamachika said. “It costs more than it’s worth.” \ Other proposals that have been quietly moving through the Legislature include House Bill 1990, which would add another half-percent surcharge to the state’s general excise tax. Oahu residents are already paying a half-percent excise tax surcharge that generates about $280 million a year to finance construction of the Honolulu rail project. \ The proposed new “state improvement” surcharge would be used to fund construction of highways and educational facilities, and also to pre-pay retirement health care costs for public workers and tuck more money away in the state’s hurricane reserve trust fund. \ The bill passed the House on Feb. 27 with Reps. Stacelynn Eli, Cedrick Gates, Troy Hashimoto, Daniel Holt, Lisa Kitagawa, Nicole Lowen, Matsumoto, McDermott, Sean Quinlan, Thielen, Chris Todd and Ward voting against it. \ “I think if people figure out it’s a (general excise) tax hike, they’re gonna scream, because that’s what it is — it’s a G.E. tax hike, and I don’t believe it’s going to be temporary,” Yamachika said. \ The measure was supported by state Superintendent of Education Christina Kishimoto, who said in written testimony the bill would enable the DOE “to continue to improve learning environments across the state to meet the needs of a modern, 21st Century school design that accommodates our students’ educational needs.” \ TAX ON OIL \ Another measure that may prove controversial is Senate Bill 3150, a proposed carbon tax. Carbon taxes are primarily designed to discourage the use of fossil fuels to slow the pace of climate change, and the bill warns that “climate change is the most critical issue confronting the state of Hawaii.” \ The measure would increase the state barrel tax on oil to effectively set a price of $40 per metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions in 2021, and then incrementally increase the tax rate over time until the rate would be equivalent to $80 per metric ton of carbon in 2030. \ It would also create a new refundable tax credit for lower-income taxpayers to try to offset the impact of the carbon tax. \ The state Hawaii Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission supported the bill, arguing “the commission believes that putting a price on carbon is the most effective single action that will achieve Hawaii’s ambitious and necessary emissions reduction goals.” \ But the bill received a chilly reception during a hearing in the Senate Ways and Means Committee on Feb. 27. State Sen. Lorraine Inouye cited estimates that the carbon tax would add 25% to the cost of jet fuel next year and would also jack up the price of gasoline and the fuel oil used to produce electricity. \ “In Hawaii, we’re already struggling with some of the highest kilowatt-per-hour pricing in the world,” she said. “Raising the price for electricity certainly would further increase the cost of living for Hawaii’s working families.” \ The measure passed the full Senate on Monday with only Inouye and Sen. Donna Mercado Kim voting against it. It now goes to the House for further consideration. \—\Check out status of legislative bills as they hit the halfway point:\ "

\
State Rep. Chris Lee, left, and state Sen. Mike Gabbard applauded as Gov. David Ige signed renewable energy bills Monday at the state Capitol in Hono­lulu.
\
Hawaii would be the first state to wean itself off of all fossil fuels by 2045 under legislation signed by Gov. David Ige and praised by advocates as groundbreaking for the state and the rest of the world.
\
""It's an historic day not only for Hawaii, but truly for the globe,""?Jeff Miku­lina, executive director of the Blue Planet Foundation, said Monday after a bill-signing ceremony in the governor's office. ""Hawaii is really setting out a leadership position here and setting a goal of 100 percent renewable by 2045.""
\
Ige signed four bills aimed at advancing Hawaii's renewable-energy goals, including House Bill 623, which sets a standard of 100 percent use of energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar by 2045.
\
Other measures would designate a coordinator and working group to promote the expansion of hydrogen-based energy in Hawaii (HB 196); require the University of Hawaii to establish a collective goal of becoming net-zero with respect to energy use -- producing as much energy as it uses -- by 2035 (HB 1509); and establish a community-based renewable-energy program (Senate Bill 1050).
\
""It really does keep Hawaii at the forefront of energy policy,""?Ige said afterward. ""We're the only state in the country committed to a 100 percent renewable future for electricity generation.
\
""If you put it into context, every other state is connected to each other, and so their energy futures are interrelated. ... In Hawaii we're not connected to anybody else, so this really is a commitment to sustainability and self-reliance.""
\
Among the measures still pending is SB 359, which expands the so-called ""barrel tax"" on imported fossil fuels such as oil, propane and liquefied natural gas but carved out a special tax break for coal that was sought by industry lobbyists.
\
Lawmakers this year had proposed to expand the reach of the barrel tax -- $1.05 per barrel on all oil imported into the state -- with new language to impose a new levy on synthetic gas, liquefied natural gas, propane and coal based on their capacity to generate energy.
\
AES Hawaii Inc., which produces about 20 percent of Oahu's power at any given time by burning about 700,000 tons of coal per year at its plant in Campbell Industrial Park, was exempted from the new ""BTU?tax"" until its current power purchase agreement with Hawaiian Electric expires in 2022.
\
Ige said he continues to study all measures passed by the Legislature ahead of his July 14 deadline to veto or approve all bills passed in the 2015 session. The governor must notify the Legislature by June 29 of any bills he intends to veto.
\
""We have been going through the bills,""?Ige said. ""We'll be engaging the advocates for the ones that we have concerns on, trying to get a better understanding and share the concerns.
\
""The aspiration is 100 percent renewable, and signing House Bill 623 today commits the state to that future,""?he added. ""Obviously, lots of things will happen between now and 2045 in terms of making decisions about what is cost-effective for the consumer and the ratepayer as we pro­gress toward 100 percent. So we'll be looking at that bill (SB 359) in the context of what makes the most sense.""
\
Advocates said despite the temporary exemption, the tax would be imposed on coal eventually, making it a good piece of legislation overall.
\
""We need all of our policies to play together if we're setting this high goal of 100 percent,""?Miku­lina said. ""We have to have all those pieces of the puzzle working together.""
\
He said SB 359 is the first step toward establishing a true ""carbon tax""?in Hawaii, to further spur renewable energy. Barrel tax proceeds are distributed among state environmental protection and cleanup programs as well as state programs to promote clean energy, reduce the use of fossil fuels and promote local agriculture.
\
""I don't think we want him to veto it,"" Miku­lina added. ""It's not a step backward, for sure, it is a small step forward, but we'd like to take the full step and include coal as well.""
\
State Rep. Chris Lee (D, Kai­lua-Lani­kai-Wai­ma­nalo) said the Legislature can always revisit the issue.
\
""Right now fossil fuels like coal and liquid natural gas are not covered by the barrel tax, so if there's a spill, for example, those companies don't pay for cleanup and that falls on taxpayers,"" Lee said. ""We moved a bill this year that would close that loophole and make sure that all fossil fuels are covered.
\
""If we need to come back because the timeline -- for coal, for example -- is too far off, we can dial it back. But the important thing is that there's a bill now that would cover all those fossil fuels, because in the long term, along with these bills, we have to be fossil fuel-free in order to save money and protect the environment.""

There was an interesting dichotomy of articles in your Friday newspaper. In one article, churches are supposedly organizing to fight against President Donald Trump's executive order to deport immigrants here illegally (""Churches will ask flocks to fight Trump's orders,"" Star-Advertiser, March 3).
\
Then, in another article, 13 members of the MS-13 street gang in Central Islip, N.Y., one of the most dangerous gangs in the country, were arrested for a slew of violent crimes and killings (""13 gang members charged with murder, violent crimes,"" Star-Advertiser, March 3).
\
Interestingly, 10 of the 13 who were indicted were citizens of other countries and ""were in the U.S. illegally.""
\
Why is anybody fighting against the deportation of people here illegally? They are violating the law of the land.

Articles favored petroleum industry 
\
I thought I was going to read a reasoned debate about the proposed carbon tax and its effects on the environment when I read your side-by-side commentaries (""Would carbon tax ease climate concerns?"" Star-Advertiser, Feb. 27).
\
However, I found they were written by two authors at least formerly employed by and favorable toward the petroleum industry. There was no thought that the industry might be causing climate change, except a statement that ""the best evidence -- as opposed to dubious computer model predictions -- suggests humans aren't causing the climate to change in ways that even remotely threaten human health or environmental integrity.""
\
I am sure you know that the vast majority of the scientific community feels human activity is causing significant environmental change and we should do something about it.
\
I think you should find a well-known scientist to rebut those commentaries in your newspaper and set the record straight. I have concern for our future, especially when I read such articles.

Legislators failing as fiscal fiduciaries 
\
Sam Slom has it right.
\
He said, in reference to state spending: "" We have obviously overspent, wasted money, can't account for money over the years ... It's a lack of discipline and a lack of accountability and responsibility"" (""Piling on,"" Star-Advertiser, Feb. 19).
\
He's talking about fiduciary duty. Legislators as fiduciaries are entrusted with the care of money. Related to fiduciary duty is prudence or good judgment in practical affairs or management of resources. The latter involves not the overestimation of revenue nor underestimation of expenses.
\
The outcome should not be expected unless it is highly probable. It depends on examining the truthfulness and substantive data. It forces hard choices. In the same article, Slom said that state Sen. Jill Tokuda and state Rep. Sylvia Luke have expressed concern about overspending by the state.
\
Tokuda is aware of the slowing of the economy. Is it enough to have concern, or do we, citizens of Hawaii, hold the state to practice prudence and fiduciary duty by making tough calls?

Death with dignity is not 'suicide' 
\
Because the person is in the process of dying and seeking the option to hasten an already inevitable and imminent death, the request to hasten a death should not equated with suicide.
\
The American Public Health Association has recognized that using the term ""assisted suicide"" is ""inappropriate when discussing the choice of a mentally competent, terminally ill patient to seek medications that he or she could consume to bring about a peaceful and dignified death.""
\
The patient's primary objective is not to end an otherwise open-ended span of life, but to find dignity in an already impending exit from this world.
\
They're participating in an act to shorten the agony of their final hours, not killing themselves. Cancer, or another common underlying condition, is killing them.
\
The intensely personal decision should not be left to governments, judges or legislators.

I urge you support Senate Bill 1129, Hawaii's Death with Dignity Act.

Abortion services bill condescending 
\
Senate Bill 501 demands that private pregnancy centers post notices advertising abortion.
\
To quote the bill: ""In 2010, 16,000 women in Hawaii experienced an unintended pregnancy, which can carry enormous social and economic costs to both individual families and to the State.""
\
In 2010, 18,933 births occurred. Evidently, abortion providers have not done a good enough job advertising their services, so it must be the women's centers' fault. And since the majority of women are uninformed of their rights and options, they must be reminded with a poster placed at these few facilities that abortions are performed elsewhere.
\
Now our legislators have stepped up to make sure more abortions will happen to save the state the expense arising from women who cannot make the right decision for society.
\
How condescending.

LNG advocate deeply biased 
\
The suggestion that natural gas is in any way best for the environment is a statement so ludicrous it could only be made by someone with a vested interest in protecting the oil and natural gas industry, not the environment.
\
Consequently, Kyle Isakower, vice president for regulatory and economic policy at the American Petroleum Institute, recently declared that natural gas is part of the diverse solution to ""continue environmental progress without risking energy security, economic growth, and consumer savings"" (""Can 'clean' energy replace fossil fuels?"" Star-Advertiser, May 23).
\
In short, his job is to ensure that public policy favors the API -- a clear conflict of interest.
\
Fracking releases copious amounts of methane gas, directly fueling the climate crisis. It contaminates our water sources and creates earthquakes and sinkholes that contribute to land instability. How does this help the environment?
\
The real solution is renewable energy, and creating more demand for it through a revenue-neutral carbon tax.

Rail's value not same as its cost 
\
Yesterday's dollar could buy a Big Mac. Today it can't even buy fries. But a Big Mac's food value hasn't changed.
\
Rail's initial funding was approved 10 year ago for the value rail can provide Honolulu's commuters. That value hasn't changed, assuming the route isn't shortened.
\
Who can fathom Honolulu's $6.5 billion cost for rail ($8 billion less $1.5 billion in federal funds)?
\
For a Honolulu family of four, it's $26,000, the price of a family car. Would you buy that car knowing that each day it would give you an extra 30 minutes to sleep in before work and an extra half hour to unwind after work?
\
Like H-1, rail will be around for 50 years. In terms of a car that could be used for 50 years, rail's capital cost will be less than 40 cents a day for each of us.
\
Rail's time-savings value is still a deal, even at $8 billion.

Neighborhoods have a voice 
\
I recently contacted the city, the state and an elected official about the hazardous condition of a neighborhood road.
\
The state didn't respond and the other two refused to help. So I contacted the neighborhood board, which took up the case effectively.
\
We've all had this experience. For elected or paid government officials, the public is an inconvenience, but people who sit on neighborhood boards do so because they care.
\
Neighborhood boards build consensus and have weight: No online presence will do that.
\
Finally, unlike all other elected positions, you do not need to be a U.S. citizen to sit on a neighborhood board. It is about community participation. Abolishing the boards would remove from a large part of the community (green-card holders and other legal, taxpaying residents who are not citizens) their only oppor- tunity to participate in democracy.

"
16,"\\An island community should know the danger of indifference to the environment, all the more so when Earth Day rolls around every year on April 22. The actions — or inactions — resulting from that indifference will simply circle around and come back to haunt the human inhabitants.\People of Hawaii do know that, at least on some level. But it seems to require repercussions that hit them directly.\And that has begun to happen, with a vengeance.\To begin with, climate change has rolled into Hawaii consciousness with the ferocity of increasingly intense storms, as have struck communities around the world. Sea levels have been rising, and erosion has been in plain evidence on coastal properties statewide.\King tides have exacerbated the problem, and stormy seas swamp the coastal highways with alarming regularity. That’s one reason why the long-awaited inland realignment of Maui’s Honoapiilani Highway was pushed to completion. It opens to traffic Monday morning.\Even under normal conditions, the rising seas have had erosive effects on beaches that are becoming impossible to ignore. Palm trees fringing hotels suddenly are standing in the sand, their roots exposed. Waves erasing the beach fronting homes and churches, and undercutting the stability of shoreline roads.\It’s hardly questioned anymore that the activities of humans have played a significant role in global warming, or that their addiction to fossil fuels contributed to the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, raising temperatures. Getting Hawaii off its dependence on petroleum has been at the heart of environmental policy here for years, the topic resurfacing again on Friday.\Tied to the global observances, the daylong Earth Day Energy Summit at Washington Place explored reasons why Hawaii can, and should, pick up the pace toward its green energy goals. It was convened by the nonprofit Elemental Excelerator, which commissioned a new report on the issue.\That report, titled “Hawaii’s Path to a Clean Energy Economy” (transcendingoil.com), was unveiled at the event. Its themes are familiar to Hawaii residents: The expense of importing oil filters through the economy and boosts the cost of living, in addition to the effect of carbon emissions on the environment.\But the assertion is that Hawaii could achieve up to 84 percent clean energy, and generate 3,500 additional well-paying jobs, by 2030. This would advance the state’s Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative targets, which would require 40 percent conversion by 2030 and 100 percent clean energy by 2045.\The report’s myriad proposals include creating an open-data environment for the electric grid to encourage innovation for a more efficient distributed-energy system. There is also the suggestion to institute a carbon tax, essentially putting a price on the use of fossil fuels that will incentivize cleaner alternatives.\This doesn’t have to be dismissed as blue-sky idealism. In fact, the tide could be turning. House Bill 1986, which is awaiting appointment of Senate conference committee members, would establish a carbon offset program.\This program would allow for the sale of credits to offset the carbon emissions of polluters. California has raised billions of dollars, according to the legislation, and the aim is for Hawaii to use its revenues for various projects mitigating climate change effects.\That’s an encouraging prospect, and one that deserves a Hawaii-based launch.\It won’t be an easy lift, though: For all its green-energy advantages, Hawaii typically makes its changes in a halting fashion.\For example: A mandate that new homes be built with solar water heaters has been on the books for years, but many projects have pushed ahead using liquid natural gas heaters instead, due to a loophole in the law. HB 1864 is the latest effort to close that loophole, an action that is overdue.\The pathway to environmental balance is not going to be a smooth ride. Plagued by some transportation and market disincentives, even something as simple as recycling has struggled to catch on fully. Oahu shoppers can’t seem to remember their reusable bags at the market, and foam containers are still the packaging of choice.\And if Honolulu is to surmount challenges en route to its green future, officials should confront them honestly. Example: The city initially gave a rosy review to its recent trial of electric buses — until riders gave the full picture. The vehicles still lack the full power needed to tackle inclines, witnesses said.\“The days of political infighting and delay tactics are over,” said Marti Townsend, Sierra Club of Hawaii director, in response to an email query about the road ahead.\“There is a wave vision, innovation and courage to try in young people these days that gives me real hope that we are making the changes that need to be made,” Townsend said.\Earth Day may be just the occasion to acknowledge the difficulty of change, but to embrace it with that optimistic spirit."

Maralyn Kurshals asserted local government was absent in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Darby that left the Keehi Lagoon beach park littered with mounds of debris (""Keehi Lagoon mess needs attention,"" Star-Advertiser, Letters, Aug. 4).
\
However, that's simply not true. There was a short period of uncertainty as the state determined jurisdiction of nearshore waters rests with the city under a 1953 executive order, but soon after the storm had passed, city workers descended upon the lagoon to assist the many canoe clubs who came to help.
\
By the time the cleanup was pau, a Department of Parks and Recreation backhoe and front-end loaders had filled 25 large dumpsters provided by the Department of Environmental Services.
\
What the mess at Keehi Lagoon demonstrated is that property owners who live near waterways like Kalihi Stream should not use it as a dumping ground for tree cuttings and other items that wash away during severe storms.

Two Native Hawaiian players in Beijing often overlooked because they were not born or schooled in Hawaii were Logan Tom (indoor volleyball) and Misty May-Treanor (beach volleyball). I remember Beijing as the Clay-May games. Bryan Clay, Clay Stanley, and Misty May-Treanor all won gold.

Takai was a great teammate and friend 
\
Not only will U.S. Rep. Mark Takai be remembered as a positive contributor to Hawaii and the nation, many of us will remember him as a great teammate and friend.
\
As a champion swimmer, he always did what was necessary for the benefit of the team.
\
As a champion adult, he never failed to give back to his community (swimming and otherwise) with ideas and inspiration.
\
As in all things, he did it with his friendly smile.
\
We will remember Mark Takai.

LNG not sustainable energy alternative 
\
Supporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) is not in Hawaii's best interest if it wants to become sustainable.
\
LNG is extracted via fracking, which is detrimental to our environment. It also is costly to ship LNG to Hawaii.
\
Hawaii needs better options to create a more sustainable environment so that we do not have to depend on the mainland, or endorse risky LNG extraction practices.
\
However, if Hawaii chooses to support LNG, we must take measures such as a carbon tax on LNG to push us to look for better, more sustainable alternatives.

Endless traffic woes fueling road rage 
\
Does the state Department of Transportation even care (""Ige kills highway expansions,"" Star-Advertiser, Aug. 2)?
\
For years we have endured road construction, miserable traffic, rotten roads, potholes and traffic constipation.
\
When will it end?
\
Road rage is real (""Stabbings tie up traffic on H-1 for hours,"" Star-Advertiser, Aug. 2).
\
I am only surprised that there isn't more.
\
I just spent one hour and 50 minutes idling in traffic between Kalihi and Kunia Road.

18,"Lawmakers resume push for a greener Hawai'iProposed bills would steer public toward energy-saving alternatives\Building on a 2007 law that seeks to reduce the state's greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, lawmakers this year are proposing measures that require little government spending but could get Hawai'i closer to that goal.\The mandate means taking a close look at electricity production and automobiles, two major sources of the greenhouse gases.\Some of the bills being proposed would cut electricity bills, reduce dependence on imported oil and help the island state do its part to slow the production of gases many scientists believe contribute to global warming.\The proposed changes are significant without being dramatic, and would steer the public toward energy-saving options without forcing an abrupt change of habits.\For instance, one measure would require all Hawai'i residents to begin phasing out the use of incandescent lights, replacing them with compact fluorescent or light-emitting di-\odes.\Not only do those lighting sources use less energy, they also emit less heat, which would require less air conditioning.\Calling last year's law a breakthrough, Jeff Mikulina, director of the Sierra Club of Hawai'i, said it's time to wean Hawai'i residents from fossil fuels and toward alternative energy.\""The money you save is staggering,"" Mikulina said.\House and Senate Democrats, who have majorities in both chambers, have yet to reveal their joint package of bills that will get priority, but House Republicans completed theirs over the weekend. That package includes bills that aim to get utilities to stop using fossil fuels entirely within 10 years.\DIFFERENT APPROACHES\The package uses different approaches, including amending the legal definition of renewable energy and creating tax benefits. It would create renewable energy opportunity zones for ventures employing wave, solar or wind energy and authorize co-ops so that companies could share in renewable energy projects.\Utilities would be compelled to look more seriously at alternative energy if Republicans succeed in getting rid of the energy cost adjustment clause, or ECAC, which allows utilities to pass the fluctuating costs of oil to the consumer.\""They have no real economic incentives to develop renewable energy systems. The amount is simply passed through and the consumer pays it,"" said state Rep. Cynthia Thielen, R-50th (Kailua, Kane'ohe Bay).\House Energy and Environmental Protection Chairwoman Hermina Morita, D-14th (Hana-\lei, Anahola, Kapa'a), said she's still interested in some issues that have already come before the Legislature, such as how to keep electronic waste out of landfills and a review of the law that governs environmental assessments.\Senate Majority Leader Gary Hooser, D-7th (Kaua'i, Ni'ihau), said he plans to revisit a bill that would require solar water heaters in all new homes, since it's easier to get homeowners to switch to the energy saving heaters when the homes are being built.\""Basically, this would translate to 6,000 new homes having solar hot water. It's guaranteed to drop your rates, and it's the cheapest time to install it,"" he said.\While the bill has received opposition from utilities, the building industry and even the solar industry, Hooser believes it has tremendous public benefit, without costing the state government anything.\ENVIRONMENTAL PUSH\Sen. Russell Kokubun, chairman of the Hawai'i 2050 Task Force on Sustainability, said he's intrigued by a bill that would allow certain kinds of photovoltaic energy to be developed on less productive agricultural land.\""What this really does is elevate the idea of alternative energy and agriculture as two complementing issues,"" he said.\Environmentalists will be at the Legislature this year, pushing lawmakers to adopt some of their proposals.\Henry Curtis, executive director of Life of the Land, said he wants the state to move away from plastic bags and styrofoam, an idea under consideration at the county level.\He also supports a so-called ""carbon tax,"" which would tax carbon-emitting utilities and use the money to subsidize renewable energy projects.\Mikulina of the Sierra Club said other ""fun"" things are in the works, such as pushing for a measure that would prevent homeowners associations from restricting clotheslines, at least when it's only for aesthetic reasons.\He also plans to continue recommending that certain retailers allow consumers to return beverage containers to where they bought them.\""We're trying to remove barriers for folks who want to do the right thing and to try to save people money.""\Mikulina said the state has worried about its dependence on petroleum since the 1970s, yet it's still an issue.\""We have to start being smarter and make it easier for people to do the right thing,"" he said.\Reach Treena Shapiro at tshapiro@honoluluadvertiser.com.\Drop-in:\Visit HONOLULUADVERTISER.COM/LEGISLATURE for reports from the state Capitol, plus blogs and columns by Jerry Burris and Dave Shapiro, and The Advertiser's ongoing legislative coverage.

I read that Don Horner was asked to resign as chairman of the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation board (""Horner no longer on board,"" Star-Advertiser, April 12).
\
Horner was an outstanding chairman and CEO of Hawaii's largest bank. Since leaving the bank, he has devoted his retirement years to public service, truly an outstanding citizen and human being.
\
The problems faced by HART remind me of H-3. What started out in the 1970s as ""Save Moanalua Valley"" morphed into the ""Stop H-3"" movement. When the project was completed three decades later, after many lawsuits and delays, the initial cost of $300 million had ballooned to $1.2 billion.
\
Today, H-3 is accepted and used by the public, even by those who opposed its construction. HART, like H-3, is an integral part of the Oahu General Plan. Disable HART and you get more cars, more urban sprawl and less agricultural and conservation land, and that will require a new General Plan.
\
Will the voters of Honolulu approve the change?

Reject politicians who won't revise rail 
\
Kudos to Richard Borreca for his column on how to best correct our obviously messed up rail situation (""Rail critics offer ideas on how they would do it better,"" Star-Advertiser, On Politics, April 12).
\
The rail will drown under its own weight before it ever reaches Ala Moana. We must plan for that reality. Any politician who fails to offer specific proposals for shortening and revising the entire rail project must not be elected.
\
The article's superior alternate proposals include stopping the rail at Middle Street and transferring it to dedicated bus lanes; adding five ""westward"" miles versus through downtown; negotiating with the Federal Transit Administration to re-allocate its subsidies; and switching to ""light at-grade"" rail versus ""elevated."" These all make better sense than anything that our entrenched Mayor Kirk Caldwell or the disgraced folks at the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation have come up with.

Vacation rentals fill a needed market niche 
\
We've been staying three to four weeks on Oahu every winter for 30 years.
\
In the beginning we did stay at hotels, but later we looked for more personal experiences outside of tourist areas. We've discovered different neighborhoods through stays in vacation rentals, supporting local businesses in communities. We've met lovely people who embody the aloha spirit and share their island knowledge and culture with us.
\
I'm amazed by the controversy. Talking with other renters, I understand hotels are often sold out for peak seasons. Traveling with large families makes hotel stays difficult.
\
I urge legislators and agencies to think hard about what's best for economy and tourist industry.
\
If vacation rentals become unavailable, we will take our dollars elsewhere.

Bravo to HECO for pushing electric cars 
\
After reading about Hawaiian Electric Co.'s plans to boost the number of electric cars on the island, I am hopeful for the keiki (""HECO boosts electric vehicles,"" Star-Advertiser, April 6).
\
They will get to breathe cleaner air and live in a place that isn't drastically different from the way it is today -- if we stop contributing to climate change.
\
As we are already seeing the effects of global warming on the island, making the switch from gas to electric is necessary to preserve it for future generations. Therefore, creating more charging stations is a crucial first step.
\
It's also imperative that the infrastructure be in place before the revenue-neutral carbon tax is implemented, since the cost of gas would rise steadily each year.
\
I hope that HECO is able to help make Hawaii the electric-vehicle capital of the world.

State should operate new pot dispensaries 
\
The state is giving away a potentially huge source of revenue by granting exclusive licenses to groups of individuals to grow and distribute medical marijuana.
\
Why do you think the license applicants are willing to put up so much money to obtain these licenses? It certainly isn't for the profit they will make selling to a few thousand patients who have medical licenses to use marijuana.
\
It is because they want to be on the ground floor of the huge profits if, or when, marijuana is approved for general adult recreational use.
\
It is not like growing marijuana is complicated. It is a weed. So why would we want to leave money on the table by introducing middlemen at all?
\
If the state did everything, not only would it be able to keep all the profit, it would also gain direct control over the process of growing and distribution of what is still a controlled substance.

\
>> Damien Kim, business manager and financial secretary of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1186, is not qualified to be chairman for obvious reasons.

Electricity users fund efficiency
\
Thank you so much for highlighting the importance of energy efficiency (""A bright idea,"" Star-Advertiser, Insight, July 17).
\
However, the Public Utilities Commission would like to clarify some statements in the article.
\
Act 118, enacted in 2008, directed the PUC to establish the public benefits fee to support energy-efficiency and demand-side management (DSM) programs and services. These funds are collected and listed on electric bills as a public benefits fee or DSM surcharge. Therefore, it is electric utility customers, not the Legislature, who fund energy efficiency rebates and programs.
\
The law also allows the PUC to contract for these programs and services through a third-party administrator, Hawaii Energy, which must ensure that these program and services yield the highest return on energy-savings investment, among other agreed-upon targets.
\
Check out the Hawaii Energy and Kauai Island Utility Cooperative websites to learn more about energy efficiency and conservation services and programs available on those islands: www.hawaiienergy.com and www.kiuc.coop.

Aquaculture is essential industry
\
Ingrid Newkirk states that Gov. Neil Abercrombie made a bad decision by signing Senate Bill 1511 (""Extending leases of local fish farms was bad for fish and environment,"" Star-Advertiser, Commentary, July 20).
\
In reality, SB 1511 addresses state aquaculture leasing for land and ocean sites by providing farmers the opportunity for a lease of up to 65 years to support long-term investment.
\
It also allows farmers in good standing to continue when the initial lease term runs out and allows complementary activities such as aquaponics.
\
The Hawaii Aquaculture and Aquaponics Association applauds the governor's confidence that land and ocean farming of aquatic species can continue to be sustainably managed and significantly contribute to island seafood supplies.
\
It is essential that the U.S. and Hawaii increase local seafood production, and aquaculture is a very important component.

Social Security has no money
\
I agree with David Mulliken that President Barack Obama should not play the fear-mongering game by saying that Social Security payments will not be made (""Social Security not in danger,"" Star-Advertiser, Letters, July 20).
\
The payments will be made regardless of whether the debt ceiling is raised or not.
\
However, to believe that there is actual cash in the Social Security Trust Fund is like believing in fairy tales. The money has long been spent. All there is in the trust fund are IOUs from the federal government.
\
The money to pay these IOUs comes from current taxes or borrowing.
\
The collection of Social Security monies from payroll deductions no longer covers the monthly payments to Social Security recipients.
\
The only way the trust fund now makes up the difference is by taxing or borrowing.

U.S. default not really an option
\
It seems Richard McMahon has been imbibing the potent narcotic of reassuring simplicity (""Defaulting could help in the long run,"" Star-Advertiser, Letters, July 20).
\
No one really knows what would happen if the U.S. were to totally default (i.e., refuse to repay any debt). However, to lightly skip over near-term consequences that the economic consensus predicts would be dire in favor of some very likely distant economic utopia is a disservice.
\
The economic histories of various countries -- most of whose economies are small fractions of the size of ours -- are irrelevant, not to mention that in recent years the economies of developed countries have become interlinked to a degree that would have been impossible to imagine even a few years ago.
\
The events of 2008 amply demonstrated how quickly and destructively corporate defaults can affect econo-mies around the globe.
\
What makes anyone think a default on the debt of the world's largest economy can be thinkable?

Show war deaths to help stop wars
\
Almost every night on the news there are reports of another Hawaii-based soldier being killed in one of the two useless wars the United States is involved in.
\
My heart goes out to the families of these brave men and women, my true condolences.
\
It's time to end these useless wars.
\
It's time the news media photograph our young men and women coming home in body bags and showing that on the evening news, as they did during the Vietnam era.
\
When people see the visuals of body bags on a daily basis, the horror of war will start to penetrate the hearts and souls of every American and protests and demonstrations against the war will commence, only then giving peace a chance.

Tasers safer for police officers
\
Larry Geller is concerned that police officers surrounded a mentally ill person and then used a Taser to subdue him (""Police should release records,"" Star-Advertiser, Letters, July 22).
\
He goes on to ask why the man could not be restrained in a safer way.
\
In the years before Taser, the only way to restrain this type of person was to go ""hands-on,"" resulting in injuries to the officers and the arrestee, damaged property and possibly officers out of work due to the injuries received.
\
As for the Taser camera footage not being released, any law student could tell you that protecting the integrity of the chain of custody is to secure the evidence with as little contact as possible until litigation is decided.

Worried that the costs of air conditioning might burn you up? Try staying cool with these tips.
\
Leave on the air conditioner and save money. That's right. Most people assume that the less often they use air conditioning, the more they'll save in operating costs. Actually, if you live in a hot, muggy climate you're probably better off leaving the air conditioning running all night.
\
Opening the windows allows humid air to enter the house, so when air conditioning is turned on again, it has to work even harder to dehumidify the room and uses more energy than simply keeping it on continuously on a milder setting.
\
So if you're going to turn on the air conditioning, leave it on - but on a milder setting during evenings. Using it for short periods isn't as comfortable and may cost you as much as $50 a year, some experts say, depending on where you live.
\
Bigger isn't always better. Many people assume that the more powerful a unit they buy, the faster it cools a room (and the less time and energy needed to run it). Not exactly.
\
The real purpose of an air conditioner is to remove humidity from the air, not to cool it. The compressor of an oversize air conditioner may not run long enough to adequately dehumidify a room, which adds to your electric bill - as much as $200 - over the unit's operating life. An undersize model may not cool the room well enough.
\
So before you buy anything, measure your room. Then look for an air conditioner that has adequate power, as noted in BTUs (British thermal units), the standard measurement of energy use.
\
Generally, an average-size room between 150 and 250 square feet needs a 6,000 BTU wall/window unit depending on whether the room faces the sun or not. A larger room needs more BTUs; a smaller room, fewer BTUs. In Hawaii air conditioning sales people recommend between 40-50 BTUs per square foot depending sun intensity and room location.
\
Look at energy efficiency ratings and save as much 15 percent. Like refrigerators and other appliances, air conditioners have EERs. The higher that number, the lower the cost of running the air conditioner.
\
For air conditioners between 8,000 and 14,000 BTUs, the EER should be 9 or higher. They're at least 15 percent more efficient than those with lower numbers and can save you nearly $100 over the operating life of the unit.
\
Have a fan? Use it and save 90 percent. Air conditioners are the best way to beat the heat right? Maybe, but the cheapest way is to run a fan as often as possible.
\
The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Environment has reported that the standard human comfort range (while wearing light clothing) is between 72 degrees and 78 degrees Fahrenheit.
\
Even at 82 degrees - hotter than the average uncooled room during the height of summer - you get relief with a breeze of about 1.7 miles per hour, and electric fans easily attain that.
\
Another advantage of fans is their low purchase cost. While a quality air conditioner starts at around $350, a top-notch ceiling fan can be purchased for one-third of that price; other models start as low as $30.
\
Try teaming a fan and air conditioner and save 10 percent. Running a fan while your air conditioning is running can trim 10 percent or more off the energy cost of cooling your room with air-conditioning alone.
\
With a fan, the air conditioner can be placed on a lower setting. Ceiling fans are an excellent choice for this strategy, because they move large amounts of air continuously and cost just pennies a day to operate. A 36-inch fan is fine for a 10- by 10-foot room; larger rooms are better handled with a 42-inch or larger unit.

To be very blunt, the idea of basing highway revenues on miles driven is stupid (""Charging by mile, not by fuel,"" Star-Advertiser, Sept. 16).
\
It's obvious that our roads need to be better maintained. To have good roads we need to spend money, which can only come from some sort of tax.
\
The current method of taxing gasoline is probably the best method for raising this revenue.
\
If we have to increase the amount of tax per gallon, so be it. With the diminishing cost of oil we already spend less for gas than previously.
\
The proposed formula of paying based on number of miles driven totally destroys the incentive to drive fuel-efficient cars.
\
The driver with the 40-miles-per-gallon car would pay the same amount of tax as the gas-eating 10-mile-per-gallon monster for driving the same 100 miles.
\
This is the exact opposite of what we want to encourage for the sake of our environment.

GMO corn seed is not benign 
\
Advocating for the GMO seed industry, Bennette Misalucha is the executive director of the Hawaii Crop Improvement Association, which is composed of GMO seed companies (""Seed industry helps Hawaii agriculture, and economy, to grow,"" Star-Advertiser, Island Voices, Sept. 22).
\
Her argument recalls the strategy used by the tobacco industry decades ago, emphasizing economic impacts while ignoring health consequences.
\
GMO corn seed represents most seeds shipped out of Hawaii. One type of GMO corn produces its own insecticide because genetic material from a particular bacterium has been spliced into the corn genome. That bacterium was selected because it produces a toxin that kills an insect that commonly feeds on corn, and that property is in every cell of the GMO corn.
\
It was once thought that the GMO corn was safe because the toxin would be destroyed in the human digestive tract.
\
However, the toxin has recently been found in human blood, and research has linked it to illnesses and diseases.

We need a new national anthem 
\
Perhaps we Americans can help settle the turmoil in our domestic midst by changing the national anthem.
\
There are shameful racial slurs that never met the needs of America and today are intolerably offensive, and no more necessary than collectors of horse droppings on city streets so needed in 1812 when the lyrics of today's anthem were penned.
\
I recommend an excellent new anthem: ""The House I Live In,"" as sung by Paul Robeson or Frank Sinatra. There are six inspiring stanzas that answer the refrain, ""What is America to me?""
\
My favorite:
\
The house I live in, my neighbors white and black,
\
The people who just came here, or from generations back,
\
The Town Hall and the soap box, the torch of Liberty,
\
A place to speak my mind out, that's America to me.

26,"
The more than 1 million Hawaii drivers who get annual vehicle inspections could soon receive mock bills comparing what they pay in state fuel taxes to what they would pay if taxed on the miles they drive instead.
\
It would be a first step Hawaii makes to join other states considering how to overhaul their road-repair funds now that cars are becoming more fuel-efficient and the gas tax revenues for those repairs are dwindling.
\
State Department of Transportation leaders proposed the mock bills on Wednesday in Waikiki, where they met with lawmakers and local transportation groups to discuss replacing the gas tax with a mileage, or ""road-user,"" tax.
\
The agency received a nearly $4 million federal grant last month -- reportedly the largest amount for any state -- to study the issue over the next three years or so.
\
Once all of the state's drivers receive their mock bills (which would rely on odometer readings from vehicle inspections), DOT proposes to recruit volunteer drivers for a pilot program to test how to administer the mileage-­based tax.
\
""It makes the most sense to look at the broad base first,"" DOT Highways Deputy Director Ed Sniffen said Wednesday. ""Then we can start drilling down to smaller groups to ensure that we understand how the processes need to be set.""
\
There's no timeline yet for the study, but Sniffen said his agency could have its findings ready by 2019 for the state Legislature to consider replacing the gas tax with a mileage tax.
\
Such a tax change could see hybrid- and electric-vehicle owners paying more to maintain the roads they use, while gas-guzzling car and truck owners could find they would pay less than under the fuel tax, officials said.
\
On average, the fuel tax has Hawaii drivers paying 0.8 cent for each mile they drive, Sniffen said. That's not the rate DOT would necessarily use for a new mileage system, he added.
\
As DOT studies the mileage tax, ""they're still going to come in for a fuel tax increase"" next year, Rep. Sylvia Luke (D, Punchbowl-Pauoa-­Nuuanu) said Wednesday. The agency's leaders said they need more funds to fix existing roads and build new ones. The Legislature rejected a proposed fuel tax increase earlier this year.
\
""I'm a little bit concerned that people are going to confuse the two issues. They need to do a good job in making sure those are separate issues,"" Luke, who chairs the House Finance Committee, said of the proposals to increase the fuel tax and replace it with a mileage tax sometime later.
\
The state's gas tax dollars make up 33 percent of its highway fund, which goes toward road projects and repairs. However, consultants for DOT reported Wednesday that annual gas tax revenues have ""flattened"" to around $85 million since 2012, largely due to more hybrid and fuel-efficient cars on the road.
\
Those revenues could start to decrease as cars guzzle even less gas, requiring the DOT to raise the fuel tax some 18 cents a gallon by 2035 to keep up with road costs, consultants with the Washington, D.C.-based transportation firm D'Artagnan Consulting said.
\
Currently, the state's fuel tax is 16 cents per gallon.
\
Some at the meeting expressed concern that rural and lower-income drivers would be harder hit by a mileage-based tax because they typically have to commute longer distances.
\
However, Hawaii's rural drivers are driving much less fuel-efficient cars than those in the urban core, according to an analysis that D'Artagnan ran using local car registration data and those cars' average miles per gallon.
\
Because they drive gas-guzzlers and buy more gas, they would likely still benefit from a switch to the mileage tax, D'Artagnan partner Travis Dunn said.
\
""People would pay for (road) usage, like water and electricity,"" he said.
\
Privacy concerns over the devices used to monitor whether a car is logging miles out of state have already come up on the mainland. However, Hawaii could avoid those issues because it's isolated from other states and officials wouldn't have to track out-of-state miles, Sniffen said.
\
Instead, the island state could simply rely on the odometer readings from annual safety checks -- although Sniffen said the state could give drivers other options if they preferred.
\
The move to a mileage tax could discourage some drivers from buying an electric or hybrid car, but the tax is still better for the environment because it helps to make the state's taxes less dependent on gas sales, Blue Planet Foundation's clean transportation director, Shem Lawlor, said Wednesday.
\
""The sooner we move off of fuel tax as the base funding system for maintaining our roads, the sooner we enable a future in which we can go all-electric, or all nonpetroleum vehicles,"" Lawlor said.
\
Hawaii consistently ranks at the bottom nationwide for its road and traffic conditions, but some lawmakers questioned whether a fuel tax hike would translate into better roads.
\
The proposed gas tax hike that the Legislature rejected during its most recent session was expected to increase costs for a typical motorist by about $83 a year. Gov. David Ige has said he plans to push for the gasoline tax increase again next year.
\
DOT currently spends about 90 percent of its roads program on maintenance and safety and 10 percent on costlier new road projects, Sniffen said. The agency will collect feedback from the groups it addressed Wednesday before moving forward with the mock bills, he added.

Social services squeeze earns a burdensome 'D'
\
By Alex Santiago
\
This ""D"" grade is not a reflection of the effort put in by this legislative body, nor that of the administration. Instead it reflects the outcome of balancing the budget, during this time of economic crisis, by placing a disproportionate burden on those most in need.
\
Cuts to Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, child abuse prevention services, mental health programs, elderly support programs and other areas that have continuously been made over several years, will surely come back to haunt us in the future.
\
During a time of rising needs, prevention programs that hold our safety net together are being shut down, and the $150 million cut to Medicaid will likely place people's lives at risk. It is unknown how cuts will be implemented or what the outcomes will be. It is clear, however, that we are dangerously experimenting to see just how far we can cut before we have gone too far, and unfortunately, by the time we realize what has been lost it will be too late.
\
Revenue generating ideas and severe budget cuts this year were shortsighted. Concerns have been raised as to what we will ""raid"" next year when the economy has not fully recovered. Instead of asking the question of what was needed in the area of social services, legislators chased a number. Scant attention was placed on what the negative outcomes would be both short and long term. The only goal, it appeared, was to agree on a number and to get the departments to implement the cuts. This is not a good way to set policy.
\
Still, it could have actually been worse. Some of the proposals to cut social services even deeper were shelved. We are therefore very thankful for the efforts of some legislators to support the needs of our vulnerable people.
\
Finally, as we start to tally up the cuts made and figure out ways to minimize the damage, we must also start looking to the future. During this interim, efforts must be made to be more proactive. Surely we all support having a social services system in place that helps persons who are less able, children, families, the disabled, the elderly and the homeless. To achieve this will require cooperation from the community and collaboration between the private and the public sector. PHOCUSED stands ready to assist in this effort. We are committed to finding solutions to assure the delivery of quality services to our most vulnerable residents.

BOE move is good but not short school year, so 'B-' for education
\
By Ann Davis
\
The House and Senate began the legislative session with great optimism and enthusiasm. We appreciated the collaborative effort to appoint a new Board of Education, and thought the legislators demonstrated tremendous understanding of team spirit during the early days of the session.
\
>> The legislators exemplified school pride when dealing with Senate Bill 8, despite the fact that they were seriously hampered by budget constraints. Working as a team, Sen. Jill Tokuda and Rep. Roy Takumi displayed commitment to ensure that the appointed Board of Education was appointed and confirmed prior to the end of session. Grade: A
\
>> We were delighted to see Senate Concurrent Resolution 145 pass, as it recognizes parents and the community as an important piece of the student achievement puzzle. Hawaii Education Matters looks forward to working with the BOE on this policy. Grade: A+
\
>> We were impressed by the determination of Tokuda and Takumi, who both rose to the occasion and stood their ground regarding instructional hours. Despite serious budget constraints, the legislators honored their commitment to a 180-day school year, ensuring no reduction in days for Hawaii's students. While we are disappointed in the delay of House Bill 945 and the implementation of Act 167, we are hopeful that schools will be encouraged to increase instructional hours on their own without legislative guidance. We are delighted that many schools are already implementing the law and we hope they act as the model for all schools statewide. Grade: C+
\
>> Although Tokuda and Takumi demonstrated a strong sense of leadership, legislators still require additional work to fully understand the effects of bullying in public schools. House Bill 688 would have gone far in showing how seriously schools take bullying and we are confident that both the House and Senate will come back next year to pass tough legislation to prevent bullying in schools. Grade: C-
\
>> We are also disappointed that a number of initiatives relating to farm-to-school programs did not pass. This is particularly disappointing when efforts are growing locally, and nationally, to improve the quality of food in schools, teach children about sustainability, and establish hands-on project-based learning activities in schools. Considering the amount of strong community support for these measures, we remain optimistic that these key areas will be addressed during the 2012 session. Grade: C-
\
Overall, we felt that the Legislature demonstrated teamwork and leadership in the area of education. We commend parents and community members for collaborating with legislators to keep children at the forefront. They worked hard this session to remind our decision makers that education policy needs to be considered differently, and with a sense of urgency. Students experience adverse effects when deficiencies are not corrected in our public schools. The impact of not passing or delaying a bill could affect a student's entire middle or high school career.
\
Overall grade: B-, with lots of room for improvement.
\
Among misses, failure to create jobs looms large
\
By Lowell Kalapa
\
It is unfair to give just one grade to the Legislature as there were some moderate successes and some complete failures.
\
Faced with the most serious budget shortfall in 40 years, the last time being in 1973 when lawmakers were asked to approve an omnibus tax increase proposal, lawmakers approved a two-year spending plan, an accomplishment that should be lauded. Unfortunately, they did so, in part, by increasing taxes with little deference for the impact those increases will have on economic recovery. In that sense, the session was a failure.
\
However, the Legislature is not entirely to blame. With little direction from the administration other than to raise taxes, lawmakers struggled to find a happy medium. Many of the administration's proposals were ill-conceived. Proposals to tax pensions, impose a new tax on sugary beverages and up the tax on alcoholic beverages were made without any input from those who would be affected and all went down in well-deserved defeat.
\
Those that survived, such as eliminating being able to deduct state income and sales taxes, especially for businesses, will have a decided negative impact on the economic outlook. Unlike individuals, businesses are able to deduct ""costs"" from gross income in order to determine not only the taxable income but also what eventually is considered profit; profit that can either be distributed to investors or stockholders or reinvested in the business, creating more products and services that, in turn, create the jobs needed by Hawaii's people. In that respect, both the administration and the Legislature failed in creating more jobs.
\
With the administration's major revenue enhancement proposals on the cutting room floor, the idea of suspending certain applications of the general excise tax took center stage. Telling those who pay the general excise tax that they should be happy these ""exemptions"" are being suspended reflects the ignorance of good tax policy and economic impact. The tax will now be imposed on transactions that generally are not seen by the public, yet those increases will affect the cost of living and doing business in Hawaii and more than likely delay the state's economic recovery.
\
The more important issue is the need to nurture the economy, which should be at the top of the agenda for the next Legislature. If there is any shortcoming lawmakers need to address, it is their lack of knowledge about how the economy works.
\
ACLU gives 2011 session a 'B-' for protecting civil rights
\
By Laurie Temple
\
Creating a secure and prosperous Hawaii includes sensible budgeting, increasing economic opportunities, and protecting our civil rights. Success in these areas can empower us and our communities to reach our full potential and to ensure the integrity and viability of government in a free society. While legislators did some good, there were an abundance of disappointments. The ACLU of Hawaii grades the 2011 session as follows:
\
A for equality -- the right to equal treatment. We commend the Legislature for taking substantial steps toward protecting LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) individuals' rights by passing the civil unions bill and banning employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity. Providing LGBT individuals with the security, stability and dignity they need will help foster strong families and communities.
\
B for justice -- the right to be treated fairly by the government. Our right to justice was protected by eliminating mandatory minimum sentences for a number of nonviolent crimes, allowing the three-strikes law to expire, and ensuring that inmates have access to reintegration programs. The Legislature can and should do more, however, to provide alternatives to incarceration and improved rehabilitation services.
\
B- for democracy -- the right to have an equal say in the government. Our right to free speech was enhanced by extending the media shield law and the right to vote was strengthened by making absentee ballot and online registration improvements. However, government transparency and accountability suffered when it came to the state's questionable dealings with for-profit prisons. We encourage the Legislature to ensure that our government is ""by the people, for the people.""
\
D for liberty -- the right to be free from unreasonable government interference. The one bright spot was the long-overdue passage of a bill banning the shackling of pregnant inmates. Unfortunately, other bills protecting our freedoms failed, including:
\
>> A bill to require hospitals to provide emergency contraception to sex assault survivors, which is necessary to ensure that women, particularly those with no access to 24-hour pharmacies, have access to time-sensitive contraception;
\
>> Multiple bills to improve Hawaii's medical cannabis program. Despite complaints about medical autonomy and the continuing detrimental impact on patients who lack safe, legal access to medicine, the Legislature failed to make any improvements to Hawaii's 11-year-old medical cannabis law.
\
It's an 'F' for failing to create jobs and boost the economy
\
By Dylan Nonaka
\
This year's legislative session failed the people of Hawaii. The governor and the majority party in the Legislature failed not only to address but to recognize that job creation, economic recovery and reducing the cost of living should have been their priorities.
\
Strengthening our economy and creating jobs should clearly be a priority for government when we are in an economic recession. When looking back at this legislative session, sadly, not one piece of successful legislation would accomplish either of these goals. It is disturbing and disheartening to realize that our state government is so out of touch that it did not even pretend to try and create jobs or improve our economy.
\
The way our Legislature approached cost of living issues was even more disappointing. It's clear that working families do not have more money to give to government, no matter how noble the program or service. Instead of recognizing this, policy makers chose to sharply increase our cost of living both through direct and indirect tax increases.
\
The removal of general excise tax exemptions on many businesses will increase the costs for families to fly to the neighbor islands, fill up their gas tanks, ship goods, and build or renovate their homes. Adding insult to injury, we will also have to pay an average of $55 more in vehicle registration taxes.
\
In all, the Legislature is increasing the tax burden on Hawaii families by $600 million. This translates to about $600 per person, $1,200 per married couple or $2,400 per family of four. When most families and businesses are cutting costs and reducing their spending, our state government increased its spending by $800 million. This 7 percent increase in spending sends a clear message that our government believes that it does not need to function like a household or business.
\
It is my hope that next year, the leaders of our state government can look past protecting the special interests that feed off our bloated state bureaucracy and focus on creating jobs, growing the economy and making it easier to survive in Hawaii. Families trying to make ends meet cannot afford another session that fails them like this one did.
\
C+' as businesses bear brunt of state's budget struggles
\
By Melissa Pavlicek
\
Legislators, like small business owners across the state, were faced with extremely tough budget choices this year. We opposed an increase to the state general excise tax and recognize how difficult it was to close the $1.3 billion state budget gap without it. We hope that courage holds if there is a special legislative session even as tax revenue forecasts are expected to remain a challenge for the remainder of this year.
\
Some think that Hawaii's excise tax rate is already deceptively ""low"" at 4.5 percent on Oahu, but experts estimate that in reality Hawaii's rate is the equivalent of a 12 percent sales tax. The impact of excise tax increases reverberates through the economy in ways that are both seen and hidden, increasing the costs of goods and services and hindering Hawaii companies' competitiveness. Small businesses feel the brunt of any increase first as customers can't absorb the costs and the cost of providing our goods and services is raised across the board.
\
The National Federation of Independent Business represents more than 1,000 companies in Hawaii, most with fewer than 10 employees and less than $1 million in revenue. Our businesses have cut fat and tightened our belts for more than two years. There is little room for state tax revenue ""enhancements"" without shutting businesses' doors. Small businesses in Hawaii collectively represent many thousands of jobs, as well as the promise of new ideas, innovative products and services that can and do put Hawaii on the economic map.
\
We were encouraged by efforts of the bipartisan Small Business Caucus led by Sen. Carol Fukunaga and Rep. Angus McKelvey and support their efforts to find ways to help small businesses that don't impact the state budget. One example was the passage of House Bill 519, which would allow the owners or co-owners of limited liability companies to exclude themselves -- like the owners of a corporation already can -- from purchasing workers' compensation coverage.
\
We'll be back at the Capitol next year, and at any special session, advocating for other ways to trim the cost of running a business in Hawaii, ways that would earn the legislature our ""A+"".
\
Lawmakers missed opportunities to help the environment
\
By Robert D. Harris
\
In setting the budget, our Legislature must weigh numerous competing demands of state government: schools, prisons, highways, airports, economic development initiatives, and so on. This can be an unenviably difficult task in a weak economy.
\
Yet, budgetary challenges do not excuse policymakers from advancing a vision of our preferred future. Instead, budgetary challenges demand greater innovation and leadership to do more with less -- to protect initiatives that move us toward future economic prosperity and to carefully avoid curtailing those essential services that would result in long-term harm to our environment and economy.
\
In this light, some of the choices made by the Legislature were woefully shortsighted.
\
Consider decisions regarding energy and food security, two areas that have the potential to drive our economic future. Much of the positive impact of our $12 billion tourism industry leaves our state when we spend $8 billion to import oil into Hawaii each year. When the price of oil rises from $80 to $100 per barrel as it has in the past several months, we essentially are taking another billion dollars out of our economy. Each $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil means an additional $1.4 million leaves the state economy every day.
\
Because of the urgency to wean ourselves away from the uncertain and fluctuating cost of oil, a broad group of business and environmental leaders enthusiastically supported a bill that redirected a portion of last year's ""barrel tax"" revenue to fund our state's clean energy programs. Last year, the Legislature placed a $1 fee on each barrel of oil in order to fund food and energy security programs. Although intended to tap the source of our problem to fund a preferred future, only 40 percent of the tax increase was directed toward food and energy programs.
\
Instead of making even a token effort to discuss the need for additional funding this year, our state House leadership elected not to appoint conferees to this bill. As a result, our state energy office will need to look at reducing programs that have a track record of moving us toward greater energy self-sufficiency.
\
Likewise, we watched the Legislature squabble over a proposed tax on pensions while the House leadership held up a common-sense, popular bill that would have created more revenue by placing a 10-cent fee on most paper and plastic bags. Senate Bill 1363 won near-universal acclaim from both the environmental and retail communities, including Safeway and Times supermarkets. This innovative measure would have reduced Hawaii's opala and marine debris, while providing the funding necessary to invest in our environment and clean energy future. One of the beauties of the concept was that it was an entirely avoidable fee -- by using reusable bags, consumers could have avoided any increased cost. It's a classic win-win solution, defeated because of shortsightedness.
\
The 2011 Legislature missed an opportunity to advance measures that would have furthered the state's long-term economic and environmental future. The people of Hawaii deserve better.
\
Spending needs to be curtailed, rules must be reformed
\
By Barry Fukunaga
\
The recent Legislature ended with disappointing but predictable results. Rather than undertake a concerted effort to address the fiscal challenge facing the state and seriously pursue meaningful adjustments to curtail spending and foster job creation, lawmakers and the administration chose to develop a budget that will spend more, place additional financial burdens on businesses and cause further loss of jobs.
\
Thankfully, efforts by the state Senate and various special interest groups to raise the state's general excise tax failed. Sadly, that appears to be the most noteworthy outcome of this past session. Unfortunately, excise tax exemptions, including those for sub-contractors and Hawaiian Airlines, that would have helped businesses maintain their workforce during this difficult time were eliminated. If there is no serious effort to cut the size and cost of government, the general excise tax will continue to be seen as a target of opportunity in the years ahead and that will place additional financial burdens on Hawaii's families and businesses.
\
Nothing currently points to any significant recovery in the economic stagnation facing the world, and in the face of rising oil prices, faltering tourism and fewer federal dollars, the revenue picture facing our state government will get tougher before it gets better.
\
Despite statements to the contrary, city officials have yet to demonstrate any clear indication that they will significantly restrain spending. In fact, the mayor has proposed and the City Council is considering an increase in the gas tax. As we continue to experience increases in shipping costs, basic utility services and individual transportation costs, we have yet to bear the added major expenses that will be associated with upgrading our city's potable and waste water systems, establishing a new landfill and closing the existing facility and the cost of debt and operating expenses for the planned rail system.
\
While these are city-related issues, the reality is that all of these activities and their associated costs fall on the same funding source, the individual taxpayer and the businesses that constitute the economy of our state.
\
All levels of government need to seriously curtail spending, focus on job creation through regulatory and rules reforms as well as incentives for businesses that will promote investment and reduce the cost and time it takes to get things done.
\
Economic recovery will only occur when new, high-quality jobs are created and in order to do so, it is necessary to reduce the barriers and costs to businesses to foster job creation, not add more cost upon the citizens of this state.

Ige made all top issues during his State of the State address in January. While the Legislature tweaked some of his initial proposals, such as changing the funding mechanism for cooling classrooms, the governor, who spent almost two decades in the state Senate, worked with lawmakers to advance some of his administration's top priorities.
\
""This was a true collaboration, a team effort on all fronts,"" Ige told reporters gathered at the state Capitol for a news conference, in reference to this year's legislative session, which ends today. ""We were successful in moving forward on many issues that have been long stuck in our community.""
\
HIS WISH LIST
\
How the Legislature dealt with Gov. David Ige's priorities: 
\
KILLED 
\
>> $489.3 million in bonds to relocate OCCC.
\
>> Increase state gas tax, weight tax and registration fees for an increase of about $83 per motorist.
\
APPROVED 
\
>> $5.4 million to study construction of a new Oahu prison.
\
>> $37 million for DOT Highway Fund.
\
>> $100 million to cool classrooms.
\
>> $160 million to renovate Hawaii State Hospital.
\
Ige acknowledged that he didn't get everything he asked for this year. The Legislature killed his bill aimed at fast-tracking the relocation of the state's largest prison, the Oahu Community Correctional Center in Kalihi.
\
Senate Bill 2917 would have allowed developers to tap $489.3 million in general obligation bonds, allow the governor to negotiate directly with developers and exempt the project, if relocated to the grounds of the Halawa prison, from Hawaii's environmental review law.
\
The Legislature instead inserted $5.4 million into the budget for the 2017 fiscal year to study the construction of a new Oahu prison. The current prison, like those on all the major islands, suffers from severe overcrowding.
\
The Legislature also killed SB 2938, also part of Ige's legislative package, which would have increased the state's gas tax, weight tax and registration fees in order to fund state highway improvements.
\
The tax hikes were expected to increase costs for a typical motorist by about $83 a year.
\
Ige said he would ""absolutely"" push again next year for the fee increases.
\
""The need for resources is significant,"" he said. ""The requirements far exceed the revenues that we currently have or we wouldn't have asked them for the increase in the first place.""
\
The Legislature did include an extra $37 million in general funds for the 2017 fiscal year for the Department of Transportation's Highway Fund. But this is significantly less than the $75.3 million that the administration anticipated annually from the proposed tax hikes.
\
It was a tough sell with legislators, most of whom are facing re-election this year. The Transportation Department has also come under fire for not spending hundreds of millions of federal highway dollars, raising skepticism among some lawmakers as to why the department needs such a big funding boost from the state.
\
Overall, Ige said he was pleased with this year's legislative session.
\
""We have taken on so many issues that have been ignored for such a long time,"" he said. ""We took care of our kids in the schools, we made great progress in making housing affordable, we made major advances in health care and mental health, we have the means to take care of those who are homeless and we made investments in our future to ensure that our children are not saddled with the obligations of the past.""
\
Ige said he would give the legislative session a ""solid B,"" noting that he is a ""tough grader"" and that there is always room for improvement.
\
Perhaps Ige's biggest success this year was securing $100 million to help cool classrooms across the state. Ige had pledged in his State of the State address to cool 1,000 classrooms by the end of the year. He had initially sought to borrow $100 million in Green Energy Market Securitization, or GEMS, funds to quickly install air conditioners and other ""heat abatement"" technologies.
\
Lawmakers ultimately decided to use funds from a federal Medicaid reimbursement, deposited into the general fund, to cool the classrooms.
\
Teachers and students in Hawaii have grappled with hot classrooms for decades.
\
Last summer, the Department of Education came under intense public criticism as temperatures reached record highs. Some teachers reported temperatures exceeding 100 degrees and students complained that the sweltering conditions made it difficult to concentrate.
\
""Cooling our schools is my highest priority,"" said Ige, calling the funding ""a giant step forward.""
\
Ige was also able to secure the $160 million in general obligation bonds he had requested to renovate the state psychiatric hospital in Kaneohe, which for years has been plagued with lax security and patient assaults on staff.
\
A decade ago, the Department of Health commissioned a master plan to revamp the Hawaii State Hospital, but it was never funded.
\
The Ige administration unveiled a new master plan for the facility in September that includes increasing the facility's overall capacity to 516 from 178 beds.
\
At the time, Health Department officials said there had been 327 assaults or attempted assaults on staff at the facility over the previous 2-1/2 years.
\
The $160 million in funding will allow the administration ""to move forward on a long overdue patient facility that provides a better environment for our patients, but just as important, a better environment for our employees,"" Ige said.
\
The Legislature also inserted about $12 million in funds for the Ige administration to address Hawaii's growing homeless problem -- about $3 million more than Ige had requested. The Ige administration can choose how best to allocate the funds.
\
Ige said Wednesday that the funding will be used to assist the homeless with affordable, permanent housing and health and human services. Some of the money is also expected to go toward public safety measures and ensuring that public spaces aren't overtaken by the homeless.
\
The Legislature also allocated about $75 million for affordable housing programs.
\
It will now be up to Ige to decide whether he will approve or veto dozens of bills that lawmakers sent to him this session.
\
He was reluctant to discuss specific bills, but he did say he supported HB 1850, a controversial bill passed by the Legislature this week that would allow companies like Airbnb to act as tax collection agents for the state.
\
Asked about the slew of police oversight bills that died this year, Ige indicated that the measures weren't a top priority for his administration.
\
""I really haven't been looking at that area,"" he said, in response to a question about whether he had hoped to sign any of the bills into law.

Improving education and pushing to cool classrooms are among the top priorities for the two candidates in the race for a state Senate seat in West Oahu.
\
Democratic Sen. Will Espero, who is seeking a fifth term, faces Republican Kurt Fevella, a community activist, in the Nov. 8 general election to represent District 19, which includes Ewa Beach, Ewa by Gentry, Iroquois Point and part of Ewa Villages.
\
Espero, the Senate's vice president, said along with education issues he would continue to champion legislation to improve law enforcement at the county and state levels. Espero, 55, has introduced measures urging greater police accountability and transparency. One of those bills, which was passed by the Legislature, calls for an independent review board to investigate cases in which someone is killed by an officer, dies in police custody or suffers serious bodily harm at the hands of police.
\
If re-elected, Espero said he plans to introduce other measures focusing on law enforcement recruitment and training standards and push for a statewide policy on officer-worn body cameras.
\
Espero said he would revisit a bill, which did not pass the Legislature this year, that offers tax incentives to businesses that open or relocate to the Kapolei region. He said more jobs on the Leeward Coast could alleviate traffic.
\
""It's been an honor to see the Ewa Beach community grow,"" Espero said. ""I want to make certain that future generations ... are able to buy a home here and get a good job and live in one of the most beautiful environments in the world.""
\
Espero said he would advocate for more cooling initiatives at James Campbell High School and other area schools and support completion of the University of Hawaii at West Oahu.
\
Born in Japan, Espero bought his first home in Ewa nearly 30 years ago. He serves as vice chairman of the Senate Public Safety, Intergovernmental and Military Affairs Committee.
\
He was appointed to the state House in 1999 by then-Gov. Ben Cayetano and won re-election in 2000. He was elected in 2002 to represent a newly created Senate district in Ewa Beach. Espero ran unsuccessfully in 2014 for Hawaii's 1st Congressional District seat that was vacated by then-U.S. Rep. Colleen Hanabusa.
\
Fevella, president of the Ewa Beach Lions Club, said he supports more fans and air-conditioning units at Campbell High and more funding for a new building to ease crowded conditions there.
\
He said he would focus on helping the homeless and improving transportation. As part of the Lions Club, he said he has worked with local businesses to donate fans to area schools. He said he visits the homeless at Oneula Beach Park, known as Hau Bush, to check up on them and connect them to services.
\
He said adding another lane to congested Fort Weaver Road would alleviate traffic. Fevella, 49, also said more crosswalks, particularly near schools, would improve safety for students, including his 12-year-old daughter who attends Ilima Intermediate School.
\
""I know the true values of the new community. I totally relate to the community that was here for a long time,"" Fevella said. ""I want to bring a fresh taste to Ewa Beach. I don't only hear about the problems, I live the problems.""
\
Fevella, a member of the Ewa Neighborhood Board, volunteers with the local Weed and Seed program and with the Neighborhood Security Watch. The Campbell High graduate, who worked as a city refuse inspector, describes community service as ""a daily thing for me.""
\
He defeated newcomer Chris Fidelibus in the August Republican primary. Fevella, a longtime Ewa Beach resident, ran to represent House Districts 40 and 43 in 2012 and 2010, respectively, but was defeated in the Democratic primaries. In the 2008 general election for the House District 43 seat, he lost to then-Rep. Kymberly Pine. In recent years, Fevella said, his views have been more aligned with Republicans, prompting him to switch parties.
\
Espero and Fevella said they would not support increases to the state gas tax, vehicle weight tax and state registration fees to help pay for state road projects, as Gov. David Ige said he would again propose. Before considering tax increases, Fevella said, all state departments should be audited and overhauled to determine if there is any wasted money. Espero said the proposed increases would hurt his constituents, especially those who drive larger cars and commute long distances to work.
\
Regarding a proposal that seeks to extend Oahu's half-percent excise tax surcharge to finance construction or operation of the rail system, the candidates differed in their responses.
\
In 2015, rail officials told state lawmakers that a five-year extension would likely be enough to complete the project. However, the cash-strapped project is now short more than $2 billion needed for the 20-mile rail line to Ala Moana Center from Kapolei, according to the latest official estimates.
\
Fevella said though he supports rail, officials need to investigate if there is any extra money that could be put back into the rail system's coffers. Espero said he plans to introduce legislation that would extend the surcharge to generate more funds to first complete the rail to the University of Hawaii at Manoa, then use the remainder to fund state transportation projects.

The Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT) understands people are concerned about postponing large capacity projects. However, building new and expensive roads does not make sense if the state does not have the money to maintain the roads it already has.
\
From a practical perspective, the focus on system preservation and safety makes sense and is supported by federal legislation.
\
As it has stated, HDOT is working with the budget and funding available and focusing on preservation and safety projects to repair the aging infrastructure, improve the functionality and dependability of the system. In order to fund this, HDOT will not be moving forward with capacity projects, which focus on building expensive new roads, have higher impacts to the environment and take much longer to complete.
\
Per Gov. David Ige's initiatives, HDOT is moving forward with cheaper oper- ational improvements that can be implemented quicker than the larger projects. HDOT will:
\
>> Add a contraflow lane during the peak afternoon travel periods in Nanakuli;
\
>> Repurpose shoulders into shoulder lanes during peak commute times;
\
>> Add a second Zipper Lane.
\
It has already increased the hours for shoulder and Zipper Lanes on the H-1 Freeway and adjusted high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to allow more users. These operational improvements will continue statewide, in partnership with county agencies, to increase the efficiency.
\
The department's priorities have been consistent and the rationale for the proposed increases in user fees was widely circulated. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser's editorial piece, ""DOT must explain road priorities"" (Our View, July 8,), contained highly inaccurate contentions.
\
HDOT leadership explained the need for additional revenues to make investments on system preservation and safety, while continuing the capacity-building program. It discussed the impacts to the program should funding not be increased on numerous occasions with the public, lawmakers and media. A detailed Frequently Asked Questions document regarding House Bill 2409/Senate Bill 2938, the user fee increase bills, was sent to every lawmaker in March.
\
HDOT leadership requested meetings with each lawmaker to discuss the department's needs and the impacts of not receiving the additional funding. The user fee increase bills were discussed at various public meetings, including Pearl City on Feb. 18, Aiea on March 22 and Mililani on March 23.
\
The proposals were the subject of numerous media stories, including in the Star-Advertiser. The stories clearly state HDOT is shifting resources toward system preservation over capacity projects. This is also not a new discussion as previous administrations had broached this subject with the community and Legislature.
\
Sixteen state senators clearly understood the need for the additional funding and we thank them for their support. Regrettably the bill still did not pass the House Transportation Committee. The $37 million approved by the state Legislature this last session will be used to expedite more special maintenance projects and is very much appreciated. However, it is a one-time infusion of funds that HDOT will not be able to sustain a capacity program with.
\
It is important to understand that HDOT is self-sustained. General fund money is not used to build, operate or maintain the highways system. Historically, HDOT does not receive money from the general excise tax, income tax or sales tax. Instead, money comes from the State Highway Fund, which is supported by those who own vehicles and buy fuel. The user fees -- gas tax, registration fee and vehicle weight fee -- and the federal apportionment are the primary sources of funding.
\
The impacts of the user fee proposals were communicated long before the final vote in the Legislature. With the needs of the highways system outweighing available funding, the discussions will continue.

The Thirty Meter Telescope debate placed Native Hawaiian activist Kealoha Pisciotta in the spotlight, making her name and face recognizable across Hawaii island.
\
""We feel overwhelming support,"" said the Green Party candidate. ""It's the kind of support where the auntie just comes up and hugs you and says, 'Mahalo, sister, for all you do.' ... It's overwhelming. ... It's truly very aloha.""
\
Pisciotta, considered a long shot against incumbent Rep. Richard Onishi, said the Democratic nominee garnered just 3,346 votes in the primary out of more than 14,600 registered voters in sprawling District 3, which extends from Hilo to Kau.
\
Should Pisciotta manage an upset, she will be the third Green to win a partisan race in Hawaii.
\
Pisciotta, a vocal opponent of the TMT, is a named petitioner in the contested case hearing against the Department of Land and Natural Resources.
\
While a physics major, Pisciotta worked two years as a telescope technician at the CalTech Submillimeter Observatory atop Mauna Kea, followed by 12 years as a telescope systems specialist at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope.
\
""We've never been against astronomy,"" Pisciotta said. ""We've always considered it a noble endeavor. It's not about taking sides. It's about doing what's pono. ... We're for Mauna Kea. We're for protecting our aquifers and sacred places.""
\
Onishi said he supports the project because the TMT has worked with Big Island communities, paid substantial impact fees, made contributions to educational programs and says it ""will provide for our kids to have technological jobs that will be required for the project.""
\
He said an advisory group of Native Hawaiians had looked at the issues surrounding Mauna Kea, its protection and where the telescope could be located and did extensive vetting to address those concerns.
\
On other issues, Pisciotta opposes both the governor's proposal to increase the state gas tax, vehicle weight tax and state registration fees to pay for state road projects, as well as the surcharge to finance rail.
\
""In general I don't support regressive taxes, those taxes that disproportionately affect poor people,"" she said.
\
Onishi, on the other hand, says the state needs to be sure it has enough money to provide matching funds for federal highway money.
\
He said he'll consider different approaches such as a road usage charge, which would be fairer since electric vehicles don't pay any gas tax.
\
Doing away with the weight tax and charging mileage tax would be a disadvantage to those who use more gas, but a mileage tax would create a large, once-a-year burden for those living paycheck to paycheck, Onishi said.
\
Many in the mostly rural district commute 40-plus miles a day for work.
\
""We just can't keep penalizing those who have less efficient cars or travel long distances or have to be in their cars for long times,"" he said. ""It's trying to strike a balance so that everyone pays some of the costs.""
\
Onishi skirted the issue of extending Oahu's half-percent excise tax surcharge to finance construction or operation of the rail system, saying it will likely not be presented to the Legislature in the near future since it was extended until 2027.
\
If it did, the 34 Oahu legislators would have to deal with it, not the 17 neighbor island lawmakers, he said.
\
Pisciotta opposes any extension, saying developers of hotels and other large projects should pay for rail.
\
""Special interests are getting special deals and putting a burden upon people who are already struggling to live here,"" she said, adding she is opposed to ""sweetheart deal programs"" where large tracts of state land are given over for use to big entities.
\
She also supports having off-island homeowners pay more property taxes.
\
Agriculture is important to the district and to both candidates.
\
Onishi, who serves as vice chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, said the anti-GMO, anti-pesticide movement is not based on scientific fact. These movements try to penalize agriculture businesses by placing restrictions on them, he said.
\
He said that GMO crops are genetically modified to allow for less pesticide use, and cites examples such as Rainbow papayas and anthuriums. He wants to help Kau coffee farmers, who lease private land that was recently sold to owners who have increased their lease rent, by creating an agricultural park.
\
If elected, Pisciotta said she would try to find funds to help farmers and fishermen flourish.
\
She would like to help Hawaii feed itself first, then be able to export food.
\
She proposes buffer zones around schools to protect them from chemical use.
\
She favors smaller, sustainable, diversified farms that don't deplete the soil.
\
Caring for the state's natural resources would protect ""our breadbasket"" and give reason for people to continue coming to Hawaii -- ""for the overall natural beauty and our environment.""
\
She also proposes creating jobs to ""malama the aina,"" to care for the land, including in outreach, education and enforcement.
\
Also in the race is Libertarian candidate Gregory Arianoff.

WASHINGTON >> Big business groups like the Chamber of Commerce spent millions of dollars in 2010 to elect Republican candidates running for the House. The return on investment has not always met expectations.
\
Even though money for major road and bridge projects is set to run out this weekend, House Republican leaders have struggled all week to round up the votes from recalcitrant conservatives simply to extend it for 90 or even 60 days. A longer-term transportation bill that contractors and the chamber say is vital to the recovery of the construction industry appears hopelessly stalled over costs.
\
At the same time, House conservatives are pressing to allow the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which has financed business exports since the Depression, to run out of lending authority within weeks. The bank faces the very real possibility of shutting its doors completely by the end of May, when its legal authorization expires.
\
And a host of routine business tax breaks - from wind energy subsidies to research and development tax credits - cannot be passed because Republican insistence that they be paid for with spending cuts.
\
Business groups that worked hard to install a Republican majority in the House equated Republican control with a business-friendly environment. But the majority is first and foremost a conservative political force, and its ideology is not always aligned with commercial interests that helped finance election victories.
\
""Free market is not always the same as pro-business,"" said Barney Keller, spokesman for the conservative political action committee Club for Growth.
\
There could be real-world consequences to the conservative rebellion. The 90-day extension of the highway trust fund that House Republican leaders say they will pass this week in lieu of a broad highway bill would keep existing projects moving for now. But business groups say few new government-funded infrastructure projects can get under way without longer-range certainty about federal backing.
\
""The majority of the work is supposed to go out in spring and get done by the fall,"" said Jeff Shoaf, senior executive director of government affairs at the Associated General Contractors, a group that donated $1 million to candidates in 2010, 80 percent of that to Republicans. ""Instead of spending 60 or 70 percent of their budgets, they're going to cut back to 50 or 40 percent to make sure they have some cash in the fall.""
\
Exports have been one of the bright spots of the fragile recovery, but without Export-Import Bank financing, companies large and small could find themselves struggling to complete contracts with overseas buyers. Those buyers will likely turn to foreign competitors whose governments have more robust versions of the bank, businesspeople say.
\
""There's not a bank in the United States that's going to loan money to that customer of mine in Argentina to buy my airplane,"" said David Ickert, vice president of finance at Air Tractor, which makes crop-dusting and firefighting airplanes in Olney, Texas ""There is not a free-market system that operates like that. It does not exist. We need the Ex-Im Bank, period.""
\
Like so much else in Congress these days, it is not that simple.
\
With its charter set to expire in May, the bank is the target of conservative groups. They are making the case to Republicans that the bank, created in 1934 to finance sales to the Soviet Union, has no place in a free-market system. Club for Growth is holding it up as the next Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, crowding out private lending and offering dangerous loans that ultimately could be left in the laps of the taxpayer.
\
""Those groups are just wrong, period,"" said Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers and a generous personal contributor to Republican candidates.
\
The bank is financed with a small percentage of each loan it makes to foreign buyers of U.S. exports, producing $3.4 billion in profits for the federal government over the last five years.
\
Drew Greenblatt, president and owner of Marlin Steel Wire Products, in Baltimore, said he recently got a rush order for wire baskets from a firm in Singapore, assuming he could finance the sale. He went to the Export-Import Bank and paid a one-half-percent fee on the loan. The bank guaranteed 95 percent of the loan. He kept the plant working through the weekend and completed the sale.
\
""Think about all the winners in this transaction,"" he said. ""Ex-Im got half a point. Baltimore city steelworkers got extra hours. I got extra profits to meet payroll, and hopefully I got a client who will reorder from me.""
\
If anything, the anger over the stalled transportation bill is even more acute, business lobbyists say. The Senate, in a bipartisan vote, has passed a surface transportation bill that would keep money flowing for two years. The House, however, appears stuck.
\
Republican leaders first tried a five-year bill that would be financed in part by opening land to oil drilling. But division over the drilling provisions and its scant funding for mass transit brought opposition from moderate Republicans, while conservatives objected to the amount of federal largesse in the bill. Business lobbyists, local contractors and local government officials from both parties have pressed the House to move forward, so far to no avail.
\
John Engler, president of the Business Roundtable, which represents the chief executives of major U.S. corporations, said in an era of scarcity, anything that cost money was receiving an unprecedented level of scrutiny. And the highway bill is more contentious than those in the past. Previous bills have been financed mainly by the federal gasoline tax, but rising fuel efficiency is depleting gas tax receipts as infrastructure needs only increase.
\
Difficulty is no excuse, said Engler, a former Republican governor of Michigan.
\
""We're letting people say it's hard and so we won't go forward,"" he said. ""That is what the business community cannot understand.
\
To conservative groups, fresh eyes on issues have produced fresh, small-government thinking. The Export-Import Bank, for instance, wanted a new, long-term authorization with an expanded loan limit and broader authority. Instead, Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, is drafting a 13-month reauthorization that would demand the Obama administration begin international talks to phase out export-lending subsidies globally, force the bank to be more transparent in its lending practices and reign in its loan portfolio.
\
Some Republicans are growing worried about the ramifications of these fights. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has pressed to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, but at the insistence of Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, he joined his party in opposing Democratic efforts to add reauthorization to a small-business finance bill. Now Graham says his party has to find a way to move a standalone bill, and fast.
\
""Come June, if this program dies, it will be the end of job creation for thousands of businesses for no good reason,"" he said. ""And it'll happen on our watch, with our fingerprints on it.""

33,"
Gov. David Ige offered up a cautious State of the State address to lawmakers Monday that underscored his achievements during his first two years as governor, and warned that a slowing state economy will require ""adjustments"" to his proposed two-year $28.5 billion budget.
\
Ige did not specifically describe those budget adjustments, but reminded members of the state House and Senate that his proposed budget assumed tax collections would grow by 5.5 percent this fiscal year, while actual tax revenue has grown by just 0.6 percent in the first six months of the year.
\
""The economic assumptions on which the budget was based have changed, and we will have to make adjustments,"" Ige said.
\
In his third State of the State address at the state Capitol, Ige also said he will propose a series of increases in state payments into the public employees pension fund.
\
The Employees Retirement System, which provides benefits to more than 120,000 employees and retirees, earlier this month announced that its unfunded pension liability for state and county employees and retirees was $3.67 billion more than had been previously calculated.
\
To help cope with that extra cost, Ige said, he will phase in a series of increased payments ""to ensure that we keep our promises to our retirees in a responsible way.""
\
Ige said he intends to expand the Early College Program, which helps high school students obtain college credits, saying that ""studies show that this may be one of the most powerful tools to advance college enrollment and success among our public high school graduates -- especially for lower-income and first-generation college students,"" Ige said.
\
Ige also said he will purchase more electric cars for the state using money from up to $10 million in payments to the state under a legal settlement with Volks­wagen for alleged emissions fraud.
\
Ige did not specifically mention his plans to increase the state's gasoline tax, weight tax and registration fees, but said he wants to work with lawmakers to ""find the funding to make significant upgrades to increase safety and reliability"" in the state's highway network.
\
House lawmakers last year rejected Ige's plan to increase those taxes to fund highway improvements, and Ige has promised to reintroduce those tax increase proposals this year.
\
House Speaker Joseph Souki said Monday that among House Democrats ""the gas tax is not very popular,"" adding, ""That's the best that I can say.""
\
House Republican Minority Leader Beth Fukumoto said after Ige's speech that a gas tax increase ""is one of the worst things we can do to fix our budget. ... We do need to fix our roads, but increasing the gas tax is not the way to go.""
\
Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell may have introduced yet another complicating factor into the gas tax equation Monday by announcing at a hearing that the city also plans to increase its gasoline taxes, vehicle weight taxes, parking fees and bus fares to help cover the cost of operating the rail and city bus service.
\
Caldwell's plans could make state lawmakers particularly reluctant to increase the state gas and weight taxes, because increasing both city and state levies would be a double hit for Oahu residents.
\
The city also plans to ask lawmakers this year to extend the half-percent excise tax surcharge on Oahu to provide more money for the city's rail project, and Ige said he intends to work with the city and the Legislature to find enough money to complete the rail system.
\
""This will give us a more comprehensive approach to traffic congestion on Oahu for the long term,"" he said.
\
Ige's speech mostly steered clear of dramatic new initiatives such as ""Cool the Schools,"" which he unveiled in his State of the State speech last year. That plan to install air conditioning or other equipment to cool 1,000 classrooms by the end of 2016 turned out to be a failure for the administration.
\
Ige persuaded lawmakers last year to appropriate $100 million for the plan, but unexpectedly costly bids by contractors contributed to delays. Shortly before Jan. 1, Ige reported that work had been completed in only 164 classrooms, with bids having been awarded for another 207.
\
However, Ige said his new budget includes $61.7 million to continue the ""Cool the Schools"" effort, adding that ""we haven't lowered our sights.""
\
Ige also said he will propose a new ""invasive species authority"" to oversee efforts to protect the Hawaii environment from invasive species, but provided few details. He said his budget includes $18.4 million to protect watersheds, forests and oceans from invasive species.
\
Ige said his administration helped to reduce homelessness in Kakaako, and said his new budget proposes to spend $20.9 million per year for rent subsidies, supportive services, outreach services and enforcement to cope with homelessness.
\
State funding for homeless prevention allowed 4,200 to stay in their homes and avoid homelessness, and helped to spur a 25 percent reduction in evictions, Ige said.
\
Ige also praised his administration's efforts to speed renovations in public housing units so they can become available for occupancy more quickly. He said his proposed budget includes $59 million for additional public housing improvements, and said his budget proposes to invest $123.4 million in new housing starts.
\
Ige also pitched his administration's efforts to steer Hawaii into the ""innovation"" sector.
\
The governor has included $5 million per year for each of the next two years to support the work of the Cancer Center of Hawaii, and praised the state's HI Growth program to encourage high-tech entrepreneurs. He said that program has helped to fuel 145 startups with $10 million in state funds, and those startups attracted $250 million total investment.
\
""Together we must pursue our own self-made opportunities through education, innovation and entrepreneurship,"" Ige said. ""We must tap our greatest resource, our people, to find our way to the next great economic transformation: the development of an innovation sector.""
\
Senate leaders said in a media briefing following the governor's speech that the governor had laid out principles that they largely agreed with, but suggested Ige didn't break much new ground.
\
Both Senate President Ron Kouchi and Sen. Rosalyn Baker also said that they were disappointed that Ige didn't talk about health matters.
\
""It was disappointing he didn't talk about long-term care, he didn't talk about mental health issues, he didn't talk about any of the health issues,"" said Baker (West Maui-South Maui).
\
Ige said later that his administration has made health care issues a priority but that he left the topic out of his speech so that it wouldn't go on too long.
\
Senate Ways and Means Chairwoman Jill Tokuda (D, Kailua-Kaneohe) suggested that the Ige administration could be faster when it comes to building affordable housing, noting that the Legislature passed a bill last year that sets out a state goal of making 22,500 affordable rental units available by the end of 2025.
\
""We heard the governor today talk about additional units that have come aboard this year, which I think is great, more units that are queued up. But again, it has to start coming out quicker and quicker,"" she said.

34,"PIGS\Hunters in Tantalus because of complaints\I'd like to respond to Christopher Santos' letter (April 6) about pig hunters using the same trails as the hikers in the Tantalus and Manoa areas.\We are there because of numerous complaints by Manoa and other nearby residents that pigs are digging up their backyards and scaring their children.\After a couple of meetings at the Capitol, it was agreed that hunting with dogs is the only effective way to get rid of these pigs.\Hunters pay for a hunting license every year, and that pays for the signs and upkeep in those trail areas. Hikers pay nothing toward that upkeep.\We have asked the state to tell hikers not to bring any animals on trails while this authorized state hunt is going on.\Most hunting dogs wear collars and tracking devices. If necessary, you can read the names and telephone numbers of the owners on them and call them if there is a problem.\RODNEY JOSE | Past president, Pig Hunters Association of O'ahu, Wahiawa\GOLF\Tadd a wonderful representive for Isles\This is an open letter to the parents of Tadd Fujikawa.\At the Pearl Country Club recently, I saw two teaching pros showing Tadd how to hit a flop shot.\I observed Tadd briefly, but those few minutes showed me that you have brought him up well.\Much as I admire his skills and swing mechanics, what impresses me most about your son is his demeanor and comportment.\He exemplifies much of what we want in our heroes and idols.\He is nice, humble, friendly, open, accessible and a credit to the game of golf and Hawai'i. He is a wonderful representative of Hawai'i because of the way he conducts himself.\Congratulations for a job well done!\GEORGE KAGAWA | Honolulu\MIDEAST\Must be recourse to Bush's actions in Iraq\Whether we like it or not, the U.S. Congress has passed a bill to fund the George Bush escalation of the Iraq war. But Bush says he will veto the measure and turn down the funding because Congress is telling him to take steps to end the war.\Bush has already started sending more poorly trained and poorly equipped troops into that civil war without waiting for the funding.\The Bush arrogance, ignoring the wishes of the American people and the independent action of another branch of our government over which he no longer has absolute control, is almost certain to result in the deaths of more U.S. soldiers.\If Bush thumbs his nose at Congress and the American people, there must be some recourse. Impeachment comes to mind and maybe war crimes trials, since Bush's actions - starting a war by attacking the wrong country - have led to the deaths of more than 3,000 Americans and thousands of innocent Iraqis. It was not Iraq that attacked the U.S. on 9/11, and the Iraqis had no ties to al-Qaida, and posed no threat to our country.\As an American veteran, I am very upset by George Bush's desire to continue the Iraq war indefinitely.\C. KEITH HAUGEN | Nu'uanu\Funding bill undercuts U.S. military in Iraq\Hawai'i hosts what may be the largest military population, as a percentage of permanent residents, of any state in the nation.\And one of our senators holds the nation's highest military decoration as a result of his courageous service in World War II.\During that service he enjoyed unwavering support on the homefront. That's why it is such a stunning disappointment that Sen. Daniel Inouye, in fact our entire congressional delegation, voted to undercut our troops and impose on them a military defeat.\The recent supplemental funding bill to continue financing the troops was loaded with unacceptable pork and contained, incredibly, a specific date for our troops to retreat from the Iraq battlefield and accept a defeat in the war on terror.\The intent, of course, was to create a problem for our president, irregardless of the message received by our brave troops and their battlefield enemies. Unfortunately, that message was: ""Defeat at any cost.""\Those who voted for this bill will try the ""we support the troops but not the mission"" shibai, but we now know how they all really feel.\Our troops are doing a fantastic job on the battlefield. They shouldn't have to worry about their backs at home.\ROBERT KESSLER | Retired commander, U.S. Navy, Waikiki\WAIKIKI\Lewers Street of 1980 place of energy, music\I felt compelled to write after reading your article regarding the transformation of Lewers Street in Waikiki (Page One, April 5).\The Lewers Street I remember around 1980 was a place of energy and music. From 11 p.m. until around 4 a.m., Flip Nunez, the great jazz pianist, along with guitarist Sam Ahia, would hold court at a club called Keone's.\The late-night atmosphere, wild and racy at times, inspired improvisation.\While there are many words I would use to describe my experiences there, dingy would not be one.\SCOTT A. KOHLER | Winfield, Ill.\HONOULIULI\No evidence ugrade will improve water\The Hawai'i Water Environment Association is an organization of professionals recognized for preserving and enhancing the water environment in the Pacific island region.\We are troubled with the recent Environmental Protection Agency decision that requires the City and County of Honolulu to upgrade its Honouliluli Wastewater Treatment Plant to secondary treatment.\There is no scientific evidence to show such an upgrade will improve water quality, yet preliminary capital costs to comply with the decision are $400 million.\In addition, other critical considerations include increased operations and maintenance costs, increased energy costs and increased production of greenhouse gases.\It doesn't seem justified for the city to raise wastewater bills (again) for plant upgrades when there is no scientific evidence that it will improve our livelihood in or around the ocean.\Our mayor is committed to improving the city's aging wastewater collection system to reduce wastewater overflows and spills.\Improvements to our collection system will have a much stronger impact on maintaining a healthy environment and protecting our public health.\Let's reconsider wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on an EPA decision that is not expected to improve our water environment, our economy or our livelihood.\JOHN H. KATAHIRA | President, Hawai'i Water Environment Association\TRAFFIC\Need to move forward with city's transit plan\Small kid time in the '50s: Being a Kailua boy, I'd look forward to the summers with my Aunt Nancy and cousins in Ma'ili. We'd beach the days away; at night we'd go to movies in open-air theaters. Later, we'd come home to their Quonset hut and drink hot chocolate, then sleep to the crickets' serenade.\When I think of the fixed- guideway system, I remember my aunt and other family and friends who live on the Leeward side of the island.\Certainly they, and islanders living near and in the Second City who can't afford a car, much less two, will find helpful a second transit option for their daily commute to jobs.\I understand the system as bringing more equity to laborers moving back and forth between our population hubs. While there are critics to the current option, it is clear that no single option will solve all our traffic problems. I think we need to move forward with what we have.\For those who think we got stuck with a lemon, climb aboard and make lemonade. For those who wish we could have dedicated the funds to more worthy causes, ""If wishes were horses, beggars would ride them.""\CLARENCE LIU | Honolulu\ACCIDENTS\Lives will be saved because of traffic data\Up to now, the Department of Transportation has kept accident data from the public because of fear of ""legal consequences.""\This is understandable, but also sad. Secrecy is one of the hallmarks of bureaucratic paranoia. It appears to me that self-protection on the part of the state Department of Transportation has trumped public safety.\The good news is that we can make progress by looking at the danger areas. Lives will be saved as a result of this new-found transparency.\I applaud The Honolulu Advertiser for investigating and publicizing this issue. I also applaud the DOT for finally allowing public scrutiny of its data.\Close inspection and analysis of this data will make our streets safer. That's something we can all live with.\WILLIAM C. MADAUSS, M.D. | Kailua\GET EXEMPTION\Aloha Petroleum will pass on any tax cut\As you know, the state general excise tax break for ethanol-blended fuel expired at the beginning of the year. At that time, many legislators proposed to roll back the 11-cent-per-gallon gasoline-tax increase that took effect in January.\I was surprised to see that some legislators now say the promised 11-cent-per-gallon gasoline general-excise tax break is unlikely to pass.\I was particularly disappointed to hear some legislators attempt to blame oil companies for the retreat on proposed gas tax relief by suggesting any reduction might not be passed on to consumers.\To support their claims, certain lawmakers and oil company critics argue the price at the pump did not immediately fall last April when the general excise tax exemption took effect. Of course, these same critics conveniently ignore the double-digit increase in the state's mandated gas cap at about the same time, essentially canceling the tax relief.\Our company, Aloha Petroleum, is not a refiner and markets gasoline only in Hawai'i, so we are closely attuned to local drivers. We strive to offer our product at low prices, but the price our customers pay for a gallon of gasoline includes 611/2 cents in state taxes, more than drivers pay in any other state.\There is no question that in a market free from price controls, any tax relief should be directly passed on to consumers. If the Legislature were to follow through with a reduction in the gas tax, I guarantee Aloha Petroleum will pass on this tax relief to its customers.\BOB MAYNARD | President and CEO, Aloha Petroleum Ltd.\TARO RESEARCHBiotech can help save Isles' ancestral kalo\Hooray for the courage of House Speaker Calvin Say and Rep. Clift Tsuji to stand up to a small band of activists pushing for an unnecessary bill to kill taro research.\I encourage them to continue the good fight for reason over emotion.\There are many reasons why a ban on biotech taro research is bad. But, I find this irony telling: Biotech insulin, which is saving the lives of many Native Hawaiians every day, is a blessing, but the use of biotech where it might help to save ancestral kalo is claimed to be a curse.\Rapidly declining ancestral kalo varieties may likely be lost forever unless new cultivars can be produced to restore vigor and improve resistance to pests and disease by using all the tools of research available. Biotech is not the problem.\Kudos to all legislators with the courage to stand up for the people against activists who seek to prevail with fear and ignorance.\RICK KLEMM | Kailua"
35,"Of Hawaii’s 132 state-regulated dams, many of which are nearly 100 years old, 123 are classified as “high-hazard potential” — meaning a failure could cause significant loss of life or property.\As of 2017 the average age of Department of Education schools was 62 years, with 53 buildings over 100 years old.\Across the state, the availability of drinking water sources is being threatened by the lack of recharge and contamination from urban pollutants and salt water intrusion. Honolulu alone has over $5 billion in infrastructure needs.\Some 3.2 feet of sea level rise is projected by 2100, which would put 5,700 structures surrounding coastal areas and 40 miles of coastal roads at risk of sea inundation, potentially displacing over 20,000 people.\These are some of the alarming findings of the inaugural report card on Hawaii’s infrastructure released Thursday by the American Society of Civil Engineers’ Hawaii Section.\“The state’s roadways are among the most congested in the nation, and there is a $23 billion transportation infrastructure funding gap over the next 20 years,” the organization said in a release.\The report, and companion state-by-state reviews, paint a picture of a sorry state of repairs both in Hawaii and across the nation.\Hawaii’s infrastructure received an overall grade of D+ for 11 categories reviewed by the ASCE. Officials said that matches the nationwide average.\The summation of disrepair in Hawaii — often visible in one way or another for residents — comes as Congress wrangles with federal ways of coping with a national infrastructure backlog estimated at $2 trillion.\Lt. Gov. Josh Green, who was part of a roundtable discussion of ASCE’s report card results, noted that while Hawaii is on a par with much of the nation, “we are more concerned because of the impacts of global warming.”\“So we have to even be a half-step ahead of what the rest of the country does,” he said in a phone interview. “There’s a ton of work to do. But we can’t afford to be complacent, because if we don’t build out our infrastructure, we will not be able to deal with sea rise.”\Most of the Aloha State’s infrastructure systems are in poor to fair condition. The report card recommends the state Legislature increase the state gas tax and support “innovative funding mechanisms” to pay for a backlog of repairs. A bill seeks to increase the state gas tax to 22 cents from 16 cents on Oahu.\The report gives infrastructure grades in the following categories: aviation (C-), bridges (C+), coastal areas (C-), dams (D), drinking water (D+), energy (C-), roads (D+), schools (D+), solid waste (C), stormwater (D-) and wastewater (D+).\Stormwater received the lowest grade.\“The state has experienced an increase in extreme flooding caused by high tides, storm surges, hurricanes, tsunamis and sea level rise,” the report said. “This harmful flooding also causes pollutants, trash and debris to enter Hawaii’s water resources.”\According to a 2018 Environmental Protection Agency assessment, 88 of 108 marine water bodies did not meet water quality standards.\The Hawaii results aren’t good, but are not as dire as they seem, said Amber Takenouchi, a civil engineer and co-chairwoman of the Hawaii Infrastructure Report Card Committee.\“So a C grade kind of means it’s average but it needs attention,” Takeno­uchi said. “A D grade means it’s in poor (condition) and likely at risk. So it’s not as bad as it all sounds, but attention and investment does need to be made before it gets to the point of infrastructure breakdown.”\Green said Hawaii “should invest now” in repairs “before the situation becomes more dire, and our hope is that we’ll be able to implement a federal resources plan.”\One possibility is to have states and the federal government sharing infrastructure investment 50-50, he said.\The tax-writing U.S. House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday held a hearing on the “nation’s crumbling infrastructure and the need for immediate action.”\The Chamber of Commerce, American Trucking Associations, ASCE and other groups recommended that the federal gas tax, which stands at 18.3 cents and hasn’t been raised since 1993, be upped by 20 to 25 cents over five years to pay for infrastructure improvements.\Panos Prevedouros, a transportation engineering professor at the University of Hawaii, said a new federal infrastructure plan “is very realistic,” but “I don’t know how much of this chunk will come down to us, because at 1.5 million (people), we’re really a very small state.”\He also takes issue with some of the grades given by the ASCE. “I believe some categories were doing even better than what is stated, and some others are probably worse,” he said.\Energy and solid-waste management are better than their C- and C grades, he said, “but then some areas such as roads and bridges — we would probably be below what is reported there.”\The Honolulu Board of Water Supply said in response to the ASCE report that it developed a 30-year water master plan, a 30-year infrastructure investment plan and a long-range financial plan to fund the efforts.\2019 HAWAII REPORT CARD\ASCE Hawaii released its assessment of the state’s key areas of infra­structure.\Aviation C-\Majority of airports in fair condition, with recent modernization of several terminals across the state. Hawaii’s airports vulnerable to environmental hazards such as rising sea levels, hurricanes, tsunamis and earthquakes. Continued improvements required to increase capacity, enhance conditions and increase resiliency and sustainability efforts.\Bridges C+\Hawaii’s 1,135 bridges have an average age of 60 years — 6.9 percent of them structurally deficient. Due to the state’s isolated location, marine environment and various natural hazards, bridge construction costs are the highest in the nation. Therefore, current efforts by state and county agencies are focused on preserving the existing bridge inventory and maintaining safety rather than upgrading bridge capacity or resilience to meet future needs.\Coastal areas C-\Shoreline erosion has led to the following challenges: availability of sand reserves, enough funding and efficient permitting. Research projects an anticipated 3.2 feet of sea level rise by 2100, which will put approximately 5,700 structures surrounding coastal areas and 40 miles of coastal roads at risk of sea inundation. Legislation on development near coastal areas key to ensuring beaches will remain for future generations.\Dams D\Majority of dams built for the sugar cane industry, many are nearly 100 years old. They have deteriorated and present risks to downstream, now developed communities. Of the 132 state regulated dams, 123 (93 percent) classified as high-hazard potential in which dam failure could result in significant loss of life or property. Increased funding needed to support engineering investigations, repairs and maintenance to meet safety standards.\>> 98 percent of the state-regulated dams have an Emergency Action Plan.\>> 123 high-hazard dams.\Drinking water D+\Capacity sufficient, but significant funding needed to address aging infrastructure and source development. Availability of groundwater sources threatened by the lack of recharge and contamination from salt water intrusion and urban pollutants. Honolulu has identified over $5 billion in infrastructure needs, Kauai requires $174 million for current deficiencies and future needs, and Maui needs $310 million over the next 20 years for source development and transmission improvements.\>> $1.05 billion in drinking water infrastructure needs over the next 20 years.\Energy C-\Hawaii has the highest electricity cost per kilowatt-hour in the nation, approximately 2.5 times the national average. To bring costs down and better protect the environment, Hawaii has mandated 100 percent of electricity generation with renewable sources by 2045. The state leads the nation in both residential solar power generated per household and is third in total solar photovoltaic capacity installed. Meanwhile over $1.5 billion has been spent by the Hawaiian Electric Cos. to upgrade and strengthen poles, lines and equipment to prepare for increasingly severe storms.\>> 27.2 trillion BTU of renewable energy every year, ranking it 46th.\Roads D+\Many roadways confined by developments or natural topography. Honolulu and its surrounding neighborhoods regularly experience some of the worst traffic congestion in the nation. Meanwhile roadway travel demand statewide is projected to continue to increase from 2.4 million daily vehicle trips in 2007 to 3.4 million daily vehicle trips by 2035, and sea level rise and flooding threaten existing roadways. Continued maintenance, improvement and expansion of our aging infrastructure is crucial to the efficiency and reliability of the road network.\>> 4,455 miles of public roads, with 39 percent in poor condition.\>> $708 per motorist per year in costs from driving on roads in need of repair.\Schools D+\Many aging public schools face chronic capacity constraints. As of 2017 the average age of the schools overseen by the state Department of Education was 62 years old, while 53 buildings were over 100 years. When a facility is beyond its useful life, higher maintenance and repair costs are anticipated. While the HIDOE is undertaking innovative projects to increase sustainability and reduce costs, the Legislature needs to consider an increase in funds.\>> $88 million gap in estimated school capital expenditures.\Solid waste C\Landfill capacity is expected to be reached by 2038 on Oahu and beyond 2040 on the Big Island. This assessment does not account for the ability of these facilities to handle a significant threat or incident, such as a hurricane or tsunami, when large amounts of solid waste are suddenly generated. Attention is needed to develop innovative solutions to minimize shipping of recycled waste from Hawaii.\Stormwater D-\Majority of stormwater systems owned and maintained by state and county agencies, with some lacking adequate capacity. Systems drain directly into the ocean, affecting marine life, and regulating agencies are emphasizing need to reduce amount of trash, debris and pollutants entering stormwater systems. Based on the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2018 assessment, 88 of the 108 marine water bodies did not meet water quality standards. Dedicating funding from utility charges can provide additional sources of funding for drainage system upgrades; however, there are currently no user fees or charge rates in place.\Wastewater D+\While some owners and operators of wastewater infrastructure, including the City and County of Honolulu, have done a commendable job of upgrading assets, adding capacity and preparing for the future, capital improvements for wastewater systems statewide remain in the billions. This does not include adequate funding, however, for several vital wastewater infrastructure programs that could potentially require an additional several billion dollars. Also, many of the estimated 88,000 cesspools statewide have significant public health and water quality impacts and will need to be eliminated.\>> $2.16 billion in wastewater infrastructure needs over the next 20 years.\Source: American Society of Civil Engineers\Crédito: By William Cole wcole@staradvertiser.com"
36,"CROSSWALKS\Military, visitors not complying with law\Working in an area with multiple car rentals and numerous military, I've noticed that many who do not comply with the safety laws for pedestrians in crosswalks are visitors or members of the military.\A friend who drives a cab confirmed my observation.\I do not think this needs legislation, but as a ""good business"" measure, I'd suggest that car rental companies provide all renters a brief summary of the law regarding crosswalks, including the fine for violation.\And it might make more of an impact if the renter at least initials the form.\The military could do a ""high level order"" meeting with any new arrivals to accomplish much the same.\LANCE BATEMAN | Honolulu\HECO, BLUEEARTH\Biofuels here won't harm environment\Bill Kamanu (Letters, Feb. 22) raises a legitimate concern about the impact of increased use of biodiesel from palm oil on rainforests and the creatures living in them.\At Hawaiian Electric Co. and BlueEarth, we believe that doing the right thing also means doing it the right way.\From the start, HECO and BlueEarth committed to develop a policy that will require that we do not accept biofuels from sources that are harming the environment. We are consulting with national and international experts to make sure that our policy is truly effective.\Hawaiian Electric's and BlueEarth's goal in partnering to build a biodiesel refining plant on Maui is not only to reduce Hawai'i's dependence on fossil fuels and limit our impact on global warming, but to encourage locally grown agricultural energy crops.\HECO takes no profit on fuel and will take no profit from this biodiesel enterprise. All profits from HECO's part in the partnership will go to a biofuels public trust fund to support research to find the most efficient, environmentally benign plants to grow here and encourage production of Hawai'i-grown energy feedstock.\The first step in this process, subject to needed approvals from the Hawai'i Public Utilities Commission, is to build a plant that will help drive this movement.\LANDIS MAEZ | Co-Managing partner, BlueEarth Biofuels LLC\MIKE MAY | President & CEO, Hawaiian Electric Co.\SAFETY\Cutting traffic deaths should be U.S. focus\The war in Iraq has resulted in more than 3,000 deaths of our brave service men and women since it began in 2003.\Every day, we are reminded of the increasing number of war deaths by the media. However, I believe we should also be aware of the number of traffic deaths during the same period.\According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, traffic deaths have exceeded 40,000 annually since 2003.\Many of our elected officials in Washington want to put a halt to the war in Iraq based on the mounting number of casualties, but they are a small percentage of the number of highway casualties that have occurred since the war began.\Why isn't the Washington crowd also concerned about reducing the number of traffic deaths?\JOHN W. HOLMES | 'Aiea\HMSA\M.D.s have not seen meaningful increase\I have been practicing medicine (ophthalmology) in Hawai'i for more than 20 years as an HMSA participating provider.\The typical letter from HMSA to me each year reads that payments for some medical services will increase, some will decrease and some will remain the same.\In aggregate, I have not received a meaningful reimbursement increase from HMSA in years.\In his letter to the editor of Feb. 15, HMSA Senior Vice President Cliff K. Cisco did a tricky little thing. He stated, ""Between these fee increases and ANNUAL UTILIZATION INCREASES, payments to Hawai'i physicians overall (on a per member basis) have increased by 82.5 percent over the past 10 years.""\So, Mr. Cisco, how much of the 82.5 percent increase was due to increased provider eligible fees and how much was due to increased member utilization? And what was the total inflation rate over the 10-year period?\Obfuscation is HMSA's stock in trade.\RHOADS E. STEVENS, M.D. | Hawai'i Kai\TRANSIT\Council should study San Francisco's system\With all the travels the City Council has made, I've often wondered why they apparently never went to San Francisco.\For the ferry system, I recommend using the sightseeing vessels that sit at Kewalo Basin until they start their tours. They are licensed for food and beverage service, which is a plus.\Riding a ferry from Kapolei to Aloha Tower while enjoying a continental breakfast is far more enjoyable than sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic.\Should you need further transport, a shuttle bus or one of the many trolleys could get you there with ease.\There are simple solutions to our transit problems, and the San Francisco system could demontrate a lot of the solutions because of the similarities of the needs of both locales.\Instead of traveling to Holland, take a flight - Hawaiian to San Francisco or Aloha to Oakland - and see what a real efficient multi-vehicle (bus, boat and rail) transit system looks like, and save the taxpayers some money in the process.\JOHN B. POWERS JR. | 'Aiea\CARE FACILITY\Cabanilla letter shows she has no remorse\The letter to the editor by Rep. Rida Cabanilla (Feb. 20) reveals that she is without remorse for her obvious conflict of interest in attempting to submit a bill that would allow her campaign treasurer to build an elderly-care facility within 1,000 feet of another care facility in Waipahu.\She again fails to disclose that she intended to be an employee of this new care facility.\The reason the city and county have this zoning requirement is that care facilities intrude on otherwise-quiet neighborhoods with continual HandiVan pickups and dropoffs and with more traffic from relatives.\While these are worthy endeavors, the impact to people in these residential neighborhoods is tremendous.\For Rep. Cabanilla to attempt to bypass the city and county laws to enrich her campaign treasurer and herself is not only a conflict of interest but self-dealing at its worst.\Her apology to her colleagues is contrite and without true remorse.\She should resign from her office in shame.\PAM SMITH | 'Ewa Beach\ENERGY\Higher gas taxes are good for environment\Bills that propose to cut gas taxes are bad for the environment and encourage purchases of gas-guzzling vehicles.\Gas taxes in the U.S. are a fraction of what they are in Europe, where taxes make up as much as 75 percent of the price of gas and gas costs more than $6 a gallon.\The only way to encourage people to buy fuel-efficient vehicles and conserve energy is to raise the price of gasoline via higher gas taxes.\People worried about gas prices should buy fuel-efficient vehicles. This will help save the environment and reduce our nation's dependence upon foreign oil, often supplied by terrorist-friendly nations.\If concern for the poor is the problem, give them a tax cut, but don't take away the incentive for everyone to conserve.\The cost to our environment per gallon is far higher than the small gas tax we currently pay.\GERRY LAN | Honolulu\OCEAN MANAGEMENT\Responsible fishermen will put resources first\HB 1848, ""The Right to Fish Act,"" was introduced by a fisherman, but does not represent the sentiments of all fishermen statewide.\I was born and raised on Maui, and fishing is a way of life for me.\Unfortunately, our fish stocks have declined severely in the past 20 years, and it's time to give back to the ocean from which we took too much.\It is sad that we must ban a technique of fishing, but when that method is so indiscriminate and has been abused with such greed, we are left with no choice.\As fishermen, we are responsible for our ocean. A true fisherman is a sportsman, one who puts the resource before himself. He refrains from taking too much and frowns on those who take too many.\I am determined to see Maui become a shining example of proper fish management without area closures.\Each island should determine the fate of its own reefs. Obviously, those who have introduced and support HB 1848 don't share that sentiment. This is a message to other true fishermen - step up and don't let tyranny rule.\DARRELL TANAKA | Ha'iku, Maui"
37,"REX JOHNSON\Political correctness ruining our country\I guess my reaction to the ""sins"" of Rex Johnson is different than that of the many other readers. My first reaction on reading that Gov. Linda Lingle is calling for his resignation was, ""Political correctness is ruining our country.""\I don't know Mr. Johnson, so I don't know if he is a sexist or a racist or if he merely has a lousy sense of humor.\Judging by what I read in the paper, some of his views may be offensive to me also. But whatever happened to, ""without regard to race, creed or color?"" When did America discard that philosophy?\If Mr. Johnson is doing his job capably that should be all that matters. And apparently he is doing that. He misused government property and was given a huge pay reduction for that trivial offense. To call for his dismissal now is displaying the bigotry that some are accusing him of having.\One hundred fifty years ago, he might have been asked to resign because of abolitionist or suffragist sentiments. Is this the type of country we want to live in? One where people are judged not by their ability but rather by their beliefs? One where people can be fired if someone takes offense at their private utterances?\If you are offended by his e-mails, don't read them. He didn't send them to you. Get a life.\RUSS BOYER | Mililani Mauka\SARAH PALIN\She can spell, but can she lead free world?\The Republicans chose a young, conservative, relatively unknown politician from a predominantly Republican state to run for vice president.\It worked with Dan Quayle in 1988. I have more confidence in Palin's ability to spell potato correctly than in her ability to lead the free world.\BILL ASTMAN | Honolulu\Story on ex-employee a ridiculous news item\The recent Associated Press article, ""Former Wasilla museum director, now Hilo resident, criticizes Palin,"" is simply a ridiculous news item couched as a story.\Why is it a headline that someone who was let go would be disgruntled?\Not only did this former Wasilla resident resign his position in the city government, but he also has fundamental differences with now-Gov. Sarah Palin. Self-described as a ""bleeding-heart liberal,"" it's no surprise that he would criticize the former mayor.\The process of establishing one's own team in any new administration is practiced in local and state governments across the country, as well as in our federal government. It is common practice that any political appointee is aware that his or her position is limited to the terms of their leader as ""at-will employees.""\It would be interesting to see how many of Jeremy Harris' appointees that Mufi Hannemann kept. Or how many of Steve Yamashiro's appointees Harry Kim decided to keep. The answer is likely zero!\ALEX DAHLMAN | Honolulu\PRESIDENTIAL RACE\Obama has leadership on Social Security\I am now 81 years old and I have been on Social Security for the past 16 years. It has afforded me a comfortable retirement along with my pension benefit.\John McCain says Social Security is broken, an outright lie to scare voters.\The Congressional Budget Office just released a study saying that Social Security is fine and will continue to be a viable program for the next 75 years.\Obama says it can be improved by extending payroll taxes to earnings above the present limits on the wealthiest workers. I plan to vote for Obama, as he is showing responsible leadership on this important issue for seniors and those about to retire.\REV. GEORGE LEE | Honolulu\McCain campaigning on same Bush message\Eight years ago, George W. Bush was elected president on his campaign for change, reform, working across the aisles, lowering taxes and changing the educational system. Fool us once, shame on you.\Four years ago, Bush was elected because he was going to lead us in a war we later learned he began on false pretenses and lies about his opponent. Fool us twice, shame on us.\This year, John McCain has said his Republican party is corrupt and has let down the country. His fellow Republicans at their convention cheer because he is going to reform them and bring change. Sarah Palin points to the corruption of her Alaska Republican party and how she confronted the corrupt Republican leaders. The Republican convention erupts in cheers.\McCain is campaigning on change, reform, working across the aisles, lowering taxes and changing the educational system. Sound familiar? He has many of the same Republicans who brought us Bush working on his campaign. Bush and Cheney, the same leaders who he says have made our country worse off than we were four years ago, have endorsed him.\Fool us a third time and we deserve whatever we get.\LINCOLN OKITA | Honolulu\U.S. HOUSE\Highway fund vote was act of cowardice\The overwhelming House vote for an $8 billion rescue package for the federal highway trust fund is a measure of congressional cowardice and its commitment to socialistic subsidies for motorists. Instead of diverting general tax funds to the trust fund, the federal gas tax should have been increased by 5 cents, which would cover the $8 billion shortfall.\U.S. gas taxes, federal and state, are far too low. Highway construction costs escalate 30 percent faster than the CPI. Corrected for construction cost inflation to equal the 4-cent 1960 tax, the 18.4-cent federal gas tax should be 48 cents. Our lagging highway and bridge maintenance program needs huge increases, estimated to cost more than $1 trillion over the next five years.\We don't subsidize electric and water consumers. Faced with water shortages, New York City was forced to meter individual water users instead of financing water supply with socialistic real estate taxes. Forced to pay user charges, New Yorkers cut consumption 30 percent.\The same user-pays principle applies to electric power consumers. Premium charges for peak-hour use flatten the demand curve and avoid huge capital investments in added generating capacity.\The same free-market, user-pays principle should apply to highway users. It is absurd to subsidize artificially stimulated highway use, with its huge contribution to pollution, global warming and congestion.\C. W. GRIFFIN | Honolulu\UH-MANOA\Trees hacked near Orvis Auditorium\Driving to my favored parking area Monday morning, I saw that the UH-Manoa music department had lost two of its muses. A pair of trees that had beautified and shaded the area in front of Orvis Auditorium have been hacked to pieces.\I can't imagine that patrons of concerts and other events at the auditorium will approve.\PAT MATSUEDA | Honolulu\PUBLIC SCHOOLS\Isle citizens have right to drug-free teachers\On Sept. 12, Richard Miller wrote an Island Voices column saying teacher drug testing will accomplish nothing and will deprive the school system of much-needed finances. Additionally, he said it is nothing more than a draconian attempt to deprive teachers of their basic rights.\Mr. Miller could not be further off the mark. Nowhere did he mention the rights of the citizens of Hawai'i to demand a safe, drug-free workplace. Nowhere did he mention that what brought this issue to the forefront were multiple violations of the drug policy by some teachers and the impotent reaction of the HSTA.\He speaks of the civil liberties of the teachers, but not of the law-abiding citizens. And no-where does he offer an alternative path to correct this issue except the threat of the ACLU standing by to bring a lawsuit against the state, an insult to the people of Hawai'i who want the best for their tax dollars and, most of all, their children.\The citizens of Hawai'i have the right to demand a standard of conduct for state employees. If drug testing is deemed necessary as a check and balance, as well as a deterrent to continued drug offenses, then let it be.\The civil rights of the taxpayers, who are employers of the teachers, outweigh the civil rights of a few people when quality education and a safe environment for our children are at stake.\PAUL W. THEISEN | 'Aiea\FUEL\Ethanol a good idea that just hasn't worked\Ethanol was a great idea that just didn't live up to its expectations. Many of us are trying to get rid of the 10-percent ethanol law.\It drives up the cost of gasoline. It doesn't ship as well as gas. You can't store it because it separates in just a few months. It gets lower gas mileage. It ruins small engines. It attracts moisture (boaters hate it).\If it cost more to produce and doesn't perform as well - in the long run the environment is better off using gasoline without the 10-percent ethanol.\Yes, it was a good idea - it just didn't work.\Ban ethanol now.\STAN WRIGHT | Kane'ohe\TRANSIT\Story on rail contracts negative, inflammatory\We are pleased, but not surprised, that The Advertiser's Sept. 15 examination of contracts awarded in relation to the rail mass-transit project found no evidence of impropriety.\Project officials explained the procurement process to reporter Sean Hao in detail and assured him all regulations were adhered to, yet he chose to ignore the facts and attempted to paint a negative picture. Such distorted representations tarnish this important project and suggest to Washington that Honolulu will stumble again on mass transit.\The federal Brooks Act requires that professional service contracts be awarded based on the qualification of the provider rather than a low bid.\Mayor Mufi Hannemann and his appointees were excluded from the selection committees, which adhered to state procurement rules. Political influence was completely absent.\Speculative and uninformed comments by Rep. Cynthia Thielen and Councilman Charles Djou added nothing but sensationalism. Since Djou has packaged himself as a political opponent of Mayor Hannemann, and is campaigning for a rival in Saturday's mayoral election, it's troubling that your reporter would not seek a more objective source.\Much of the factual information in the article, including details about the contracts, had already been described in The Advertiser's pages months or even years ago, so we're puzzled by your decision to rake over such old coals at this point in time.\You have done your readers a great disservice by publishing such inflammatory material.\RICHARD TORRES | Deputy director, Department of Transportation Services\MARK OTO | Deputy director, Department of Budget and Fiscal Services\Drop-in:\THE ADVERTISER'S BLOGS\The Hot Seat\Editorial and Opinion Editor Jeanne Mariani-Belding puts Majken Mechling, executive director of the American Diabetes Association in Hawai'i, on The Hot Seat for a live blog chat today from noon to 1 p.m. Join the conversation at\HONOLULUADVERTISE.COM/OPINION\Drop-in:CAST YOUR VOTE\Make your opinion count in our daily online poll and see the results.

38,"Here is the status of major bills near the halfway point of the 60-day legislative session. The bills that are alive have passed at least one chamber of the Legislature, or are about to pass.\The bills that are failing were not approved by the House or Senate by Thursday’s procedural deadline. Failing bills can be revived later, however, and measures can be rewritten to change their effect before the session adjourns in May.\GOVERNMENT\Passing\Election recounts\HB 428 HD1\Would require an automatic recount of votes when the difference between two candidates is 100 votes or less or 0.5 percent.\ConAm on election recounts\HB 709 HD1\Would propose an amendment to the state Constitution allowing the Legislature to enact voter recount laws.\Office vacancies\HB 626\Would require a special election be held to fill vacancies in the U.S. Senate and state Legislature that occur when someone resigns or dies during their term. Currently, the governor chooses a replacement from a list of nominees submitted by the respective political party.

39," Question: If they replace the gas tax with a user fee, how will they know how many miles you drive? \ Answer: The state Department of Transportation is considering various ways to track a car’s mileage. One way would be to compare year-to-year mileage during a vehicle’s safety check, but that apparently would only document properly registered vehicles (Kokua Line receives perennial complaints about cars with expired or missing safety stickers). Other possible methods include using smartphone apps or plug-in devices to record mileage, according to the DOT. \ Thousands of vehicle owners will receive “driving reports” this month that estimate how much they would pay if the state scraps the gas tax in favor of a per-mile usage fee, as is being considered. Learn more at hiruc.org \ Mahalo \ Big mahalo to NOAA and the Hawaii Marine Animal Response crew who came to help an injured young sea turtle on my backyard beach. It had cord wrapped tightly around both front flippers and its neck. I called the HMAR emergency line and Karlee was so helpful and supportive. It was getting dark and they could not send a team out until morning. Fortunately the exhausted turtle stayed on the beach all night. I called again at dawn and Karlee immediately dispatched a rescue team. They came and assessed the animal and agreed it likely needed surgery and they got it loaded up and took it to NOAA for vet care. What a wonderful team effort. Sadly these animals are living among our trash in their environment. It felt good to be able to help one. Don’t assume a basking turtle is OK. Look closely (without touching or harassing in any way). If you see any marine mammal needing help, don’t hesitate to call the emergency line. I left a message and they called me back in minutes. Mahalo again to all involved in helping this lucky turtle. I’m hoping it will go on to live well for decades. — Heidi Better, Honolulu \ How to help  \ Your Mahalo submission inspired us to find out more about HMAR, and to check with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration about assessing turtles for signs of distress. \ HMAR is a nonprofit organization that partners with NOAA and other agencies to rescue protected marine species and preserve Hawaii’s ocean ecosystem, according to its website, h-mar.org/. \ The number you called — 888-256-9840 — is for monk seal sightings, and to report sea turtles, monk seals, dolphins or whales in distress. The area code is 888 (not 808). \ The public also can report seabirds in distress, to 687-7900 (area code is 808), the website says. \ Jolene Lau, a spokeswoman for NOAA, praised HMAR’s work and explained some “dos and don’ts” for members of the public trying to determine whether a marine animal needs help. \ When considering how closely to approach the animal, “it’s important to distinguish between turtles and marine mammals like seals and whales,” Lau said in an email. \ “For turtles, it’s OK to get fairly close (we recommend to stay at least 10 feet away) and, yes, at that distance you can inspect the turtle with the naked eye to see if there are any signs of injury or entanglement,” she said. “For monk seals and other marine mammals, however, the public should not approach closely. These animals should be viewed from a much greater distance, using binoculars to get an up close view.” \ Recommended distances vary by species: 50 yards for dolphins, 100 yards for humpback whales (based on federal law) and behind any rope or signage for monk seals, or at least 50 feet away when no rope or signage is present, she said. \ Call the same hotline and follow the voice prompts to report any of those species in distress. \ Write to Kokua Line at Honolulu Star-Advertiser, 7 Waterfront Plaza, Suite 210, 500 Ala Moana Blvd., Honolulu 96813; call 529-4773; fax 529-4750; or email kokualine@staradvertiser.com.

40,"COMMUTING\Gas tax hike gives one more reason to bike\Regarding the gas tax increase (Advertiser, Dec. 20), this is just one more reason to commute as ""green"" as possible, as often as possible -- in other words, bicycles.\Long-distance travel aside, surely much of local commuting can be accomplished by cycling rather than using that convenient car, which dumps 20 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere for every gallon of fuel used. And, hey, we'll even get a bit of exercise in the process.\Government: Repair the roads and install (or just paint) bike lanes to get this no-brainer going!\Reader: Take action by purchasing a bicycle and contact the Department of Transportation.\Jeffrey Friedman | Makiki\IRAQ\The time has come to give peace a chance\Suppose the United States was bombed, with 100,000 civilians killed, mostly women and children. The bomber country invades and tries to bring ""stability"" to the U.S. Would we not see this country's troops as occupiers? Would we not label people working for this occupying force as ""traitors?"" Would we not defend and rid these foreign invaders from our shores? You bet ya!\Since the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq, more than 600,000 Iraqi civilians have died, mostly women and children.\According to political historian Howard Zimms, the Vietnam War death toll was 15 percent soldiers to 85 percent civilians, mostly women and children. War kills the innocent. It does not promote peace. War inflames revenge and violence.\Our soldiers must leave with the Iraqis as our friends. The United Nations could be invited by Iraq to help stabilize the country and borders. The U.S. should offer help with money and advisers to promote peace for health, safe drinking water, utilities and education.\Remember the American people stopped the war in Vietnam. Now Vietnam is the top economic power in Southeast Asia and a U.S. ally.\Give peace a chance in Iraq.\Mary A.

This flier is available at the Salt Lake/Moanalua Public Library, 3225 Salt Lake Boulevard.\Additionally, Mr. Mishima can refer to the Hawai'i Driver's Manual, Chapter X, Safe Driving Techniques, ""Roundabout,"" for instructions on how to properly use a roundabout, which can be found on the state Web site: http://www.hawaii.gov/dot/highways/hwy-v/HIDrvMan.pdf\Melvin N. Kaku | Director, Department of Transportation Services\PROPERTY ASSESSMENT\Costs, taxes going up all around the state\I received my 2007 real property assessment in the mail the other day.\After last year's 20 percent increase in value, I thought this year would be better. Silly me. This year's increase is a whopping 33.5 percent!! It is an increase of a little less than $300,000. I am not rich. I do not live in a luxury home. I do not live in Portlock, Kahala or any other rich community.\I bought my house for less than half of what the appraised value is today. With the general excise tax increasing, the gasoline tax increasing, HECO's rates increasing and my monthly parking rate at work increasing on top of this so-called real property assessment, no wonder there is a huge homeless problem in this state.\P.

Watada's reasons don't justify his actions\Sorry, Lt Ehren Watada, there is nothing complex about honoring a signed contract, especially when you were not under duress when you committed to become an officer.\My son signed as a young 2nd lieutenant in early 1990, and honored his commitment then.\Watada appears to be an intelligent man, but his reasons for not serving are certainly not compelling enough to warrant justification of his actions, First Amendment rights, notwithstanding. He deserves to be court-martialed and spend time in prison. Appropriate social justice, in my opinion, should prevail.\Mel Padello | Waipahu\Watada has opposed war that is a travesty\Recently, Lt. Ehren Watada spoke eloquently of his decision not to deploy to Iraq.\A commissioned officer, he is the first to be prosecuted by the military since 1965 for voicing his opinion and taking a stand against a war he believes immoral and unconstitutional. Lt. Watada's decision clearly was difficult and based on conscience.\My parents and I listened closely with the audience. My father is a retired Navy officer who served in World War II, and my mother served as a cadet nurse. Along with the audience, we were overwhelmingly impressed by the serious young lieutenant.\It is courageous to refuse to lead your troops into a war you truly believe is immoral and unconstitutional. It is courageous to face a military Goliath and possible six-year prison term.\I shook Lt. Watada's hand, and knew I had met a truthful and brave man, a hero, who knows as an officer that his duty is to protect the U.S. Constitution and his country.\Lt. Watada has taken a stand against a war many of us believe is a horrifying travesty.\Bambi Lin Litchman | Mo'ili'ili\MAHALO\Many called seeking their lost family dogs\The photo of the dog who had been found wandering touched me deeply.\My dog was stolen a year ago in Hau'ula, and the dog in the picture in the Dec. 19 Advertiser was a dead ringer for my missing 12-year-old companion.\When I called the Royos family in Waiahole and described my dog they said, yes, it is a female with a white chest, but, no, it isn't an older dog but a feisty younger one and she had been reunited with her Ka'a'awa owners.\Mrs. Royos said several people called looking for their lost dogs. Mahalo to the Royos family.\Mori Beddoes | Hau'ula\DEPARTURE\DOT chief Haraga brought good changes\It was a shock and surprise to learn of the departure of Rodney Haraga as director of the state Department of Transportation.\During his tenure, the citizens of this state witnessed a remarkable and welcomed change in the attitude and responsiveness of that agency. For those who had to work with previous transportation directors, the difference was noticeable and welcomed.\Mr. Haraga truly seemed to enjoy meeting with the public and responding to their concerns, and actually followed up on the suggestions made by citizens concerning highway and traffic conditions.\Under his administration, his department responded more quickly to everything from filling potholes and installing needed signage to repairing major landslides blocking highways.\Whatever the reasons may be for the governor's decision not to reappoint him, Rodney Haraga will be greatly missed.\Roy Yanagihara | Kane'ohe\DEPLETED URANIUM\Army committed to cleanup at Schofield\This letter is in response to statements made concerning depleted uranium (DU) in a letter from Doug Fox (Dec. 21).\Army policy prohibits the use of DU ammunition in training. Therefore the 105mm DU round will not be used in any training areas in Hawai'i or elsewhere.\The DU discovered last year are remnants of spotting round tailfin assemblies of an obsolete weapon system that was removed from the Army inventory in the early 1960s.\The DU was used in spotting rounds for that system because of its high density and weight -- not as an armor penetrator. The portion of the impact area in which these tailfins were found has extremely restrictive access, and exposure to any potential hazard is controllable and negligible.\There are no plans for any vehicles to freely maneuver in the impact area, disturbing soils.\The Army takes very seriously all issues and public concerns arising from the 2005 discovery of DU found during the cleanup of unexploded ordnance from the range complex at Schofield Barracks.\The Army is taking appropriate measures to survey and assess the situation and to develop and implement a comprehensive remediation strategy in consultation with the appropriate state and federal regulators.\Army officials are working with the U.S. Army's Joint Munitions Command and other Army and Federal organizations to conduct a formal survey and analysis of the site to determine future actions and necessary cleanup.\The Army is committed to the environment and to the sustainability of the land entrusted to it. We will wholeheartedly continue our efforts to identify and remediate issues like that posed by the discovery of DU at Schofield Barracks.\Lt. Gen. John M. Brown, III | Commander, U.S. Army, Pacific"
41,"VACATION RENTALS\R&R accommodations can be found on base\In response to Paul Swart's Jan. 21 letter about B&Bs: Nice try, Mr. Swart, but the military on R&R have access exclusively to some very affordable accommodations with outstanding amenities on bases such as Bellows and Marine Corps Base Hawai'i at Kane'ohe.\They are very nice, uncrowded beaches, and you don't have to worry about your belongings being stolen.\LAUREL ANDERSON | Kailua\TURTLE BAY\In our interest to keep North Shore pristine\The idea to preserve Turtle Bay area is phenomenal.\I am a longtime North Shore resident and this sounds great. The North Shore is already showing signs of pollution and is getting more and more abused and looking less and less beautiful. The traffic is horrendous even now.\The ocean is getting polluted and the beaches don't look as nice as before. There is trash on the beaches.\The entire North Shore should be limited and frozen to development.\Most tourists that I talk to on the North Shore have escaped from Waikiki because they think it is crazy - too busy, too loud, too artificial. They got that at home and are looking for something relaxing instead. So, keep North Shore pretty, keep it pristine, keep it quaint.\The bottom line is that's what we sell here in Hawai'i: a more sane, natural lifestyle, in a pristine environment.\It is in our best interest to keep our environment pristine and our lifestyle simple and natural. Nobody else has that - so they will pay big bucks to come here to experience it.\MILICA BARJAKTAROVIC | Waialua\Property worth what buyer willing to pay\Since when is a property worth significantly more than the value sought in a foreclosure? If $283 million, or even $400 million, were the true value of the Turtle Bay Resort, why aren't savvy businesses lining up to take advantage of the bargain?\According to the foreclosure complaint, the borrower utilized proceeds to make ""a one-time distribution to the beneficial owners."" What did the owners do with the money they paid themselves? Why haven't they used the funds to repay their obligation?\Besides being a director of Keep the North Shore Country, I have been in the mortgage-lending business for 16 years and one fact is abundantly clear: The value of real estate is determined by what an informed buyer is willing to pay, not what a seller hopes to get.\This resort is probably worth much less than the ""asking price"" of $283 million.\GIL RIVIERE | Waialua\Protect Turtle Bay as one of last rural places\As a lifetime resident of the North Shore, I share the desire to protect Turtle Bay as one of the last rural and old-Hawai'i outlets.\It is a beautiful and peaceful place. It is sacred for the Hawaiians, with many iwi on the land.\It must be protected for our children and their children.\Turtle Bay (and the North Shore as a whole) is a special place for locals on O'ahu and visiting tourists.\I humbly ask you to support Gov. Linda Lingle's proposal in this critical time.\MATTHEW CABAMONGAN | Hale'iwa\DEATH PENALTY\Deterrence a start in fixing prison system\The article ""Room for improvement"" by Ronald Becker (Focus, Jan. 20) was thought-provoking, and the message was clear: The rule of thumb for community treatment of inmates is out of sight, out of mind.\But their absence takes a toll on their families, and inmates typically return to their old neighborhoods with no new virtues, only new vices such as being more violent. In other words, the corrections system is dysfunctional; inmates are not reformed.\It appears the best remedy is preventive medicine. Why not try and discourage the conduct in the first place through deterrence? Where to start? How about imposing the death penalty on drug dealers?\JAMES EVERS | Honolulu\THIRD-WORLD ROADS\Potholes, ruts help develop driving skills\I'd like to thank the great leaders of the city and the state for providing me with all the free training I've had for many, many (too many) years.\I am now totally qualified to drive on any rutted, potholed, rough or washboard road in all the Third-World countries.\Driving on O'ahu roads reminds me of someone learning to ski moguls.\I only have one complaint. On a recent day I was maneuvering between ruts and holes and all of a sudden I was on a smooth surface. This is extremely dangerous and I feel the state should be posting signs, ""Danger: Smooth Road Ahead.""\RAY JEFFS | Honolulu\REEFS\Fresh water also is needed in ecosystem\I would like to express my concern, which was missed in The Advertiser's recent article, ""It's the year of the reef"" (Jan. 24) to no fault of your writer.\I would have expected Alan Friedlander to have made mention of an element critical in a thriving nearshore ocean ecosystem - ""fresh water"" and the lack thereof.\I'm not talking about runoff or water from sewage plants. I'm talking about nearshore springs and streams that feed this crucial element into our nearshore estuaries and the ocean's ecosystem.\Much of nature's water that once made it to our ocean has now been capped or diverted for O'ahu's growing population, especially on our south and west shores, where even Freidlander admits reefs are in poor health.\Many indigenous species have a critical time of development that depend on this natural occurrence.\We must take this important issue into consideration when helping to protect and preserve our natural resources.\CARL M. JELLINGS | Wai'anae\HAWAI'I\Don't do stupid things just for sustainability\I hear the political slogan of sustainability a lot and am wondering what it could possibly mean with respect to Hawai'i.\Several ships come here every week carrying thousands of items that are made, grown or found elsewhere. If we should achieve sustainability in any one item, how about the other thousands of items that are not or can not be created in Hawai'i?\If in the name of sustainability we should make uneconomic choices, then we pay the price for that in a lower standard of living and/or reduced competitiveness in business.\It is a fallacy to separate Hawai'i's economy from the rest of the country and imagine that doing things locally makes us richer. It makes the whole country materially richer (including Hawai'i) if things are produced where they can be produced most efficiently.\A pretty good rule of thumb is that if the market hasn't already created a Hawai'i source for some product, then it is likely because that activity is uneconomical in Hawai'i.\Issues about oil and gasoline require very careful analysis because sustainability and ""feeling good"" can interfere with solid analysis. Even though sugar is the preferred feed stock for ethanol, none of our sugar companies who have studied the market and who can get 100 percent tax write-offs to build a plant have started one yet.\Hawai'i is not going to turn global problems around. We should be careful not to do too many stupid things in the name of sustainability, or we will have sustainability because no one can afford to live here.\HAROLD G. LOOMIS | Honolulu\UH\Ask questions before spending more money\Recent reports of shoddy maintenance at the University of Hawai'i are absolutely outrageous. The poor facilities for football are only a part of the larger picture: a university gone bad with shoddy maintenance.\Obviously some money is needed. But before the Legislature throws huge mounds of money at the university, some questions should be asked.\We need to know what money has gone to the university and where the money went. How much money has the Legislature appropriated per student, and how does that compare with other universities?\Has the maintenance staff done a good job considering funds available?\So before the Legislature appropriates more money to improve university facilities, it should get the facts first as to what has been done with the money already given to the campus.\And while we are at it, the Board of Regents needs to ask what the chancellor and president of the university have done about the situation. Do we, perhaps, need a new administration at the university?\Let us act, but let us get the facts first. The students at the university are the ones who are poorly served. They are preparing for their futures, and we should not let them down.\MARK TERRY | Honolulu\GOVERNMENT\Taxes are culprit in high price of gasoline\I read with interest the column by Sen. Ron Menor (Focus, Jan. 20). I wanted to see if he would get to the true culprit in the price of gas. But he didn't, which was what I expected.\At no point in his column did he mention the amount of taxes levied on gas by the federal and state governments.\The federal tax is 18.4 cents per gallon. The state gas tax is 60.1 cents a gallon. This means every gallon in Hawai'i has 78.5 cents of tax on it.\With gas at about $3.31 a gallon, taxes make up about 25 percent of the price of a gallon.\There is only one state that has higher gas taxes than Hawai'i - New York.\With that amount of tax revenue, we should have world-class streets and roads. Instead, we have world-classless roads.\So, Sen. Menor, come clean on who is the largest reason of the high cost of gas and oil.\LARRY SYMONS | Honolulu"
42,"ELECTION 2006\'Yes' vote on Charter amendment 3 urged\On this year's election ballot, Charter amendment 3 addresses two major concerns in Hawai'i: affordable housing and the environment.\As a senior graduating this winter from the University of Hawai'i-Mnoa, one likes to know what possible future lies ahead.\With the enactment of this bill, the future will look much brighter for O'ahu.\I urge people who are interested in affordable housing and a cleaner environment to vote for this amendment.\JESSE SHAIN | Honolulu\Criticism of Hirono on war misses mark\Dr. Edward Gutteling accuses Mazie Hirono of running away from a fight because she wants to stop funding outdated weapons systems, unproven weapons systems and our current missile defense systems (Letters, Oct. 27).\My, what a wacky idea, doing away with waste - money that could be better spent supporting our troops.\He further chides her for coming up with an idea of starting a department of peace. Maybe had we looked at peaceful alternatives and allowed international inspectors to finish their job, we would not be wasting $2 billion a week on a war that claimed more than 100 precious U.S. lives in October alone.\ROBERT LLOYD | 'Ewa Beach\Lingle has changed state for the better\If you take a minute to remember what state government was like four years ago during Democrat rule, you'll realize just how critical this upcoming election is.\Just four years ago, an endless network of insider connections existed in all aspects of government.\The economy was down the drain, the State Hospital was failing miserably, the ice epidemic was on the rise, doing business in Hawai'i was a nightmare, and finding a decent job was near impossible.\Even pets suffered as a result of outdated quarantine rules.\But all of this has changed for the better with Gov. Linda Lingle's and Lt. Gov. James ""Duke"" Aiona's leadership. We're finally on the right track, and we cannot afford to go backward. We need to re-elect this team so they can continue the great job they started.\SALLY HARPER | Honolulu\Ward the best choice to serve Hawai'i Kai\Congratulations on your endorsement of former representative Gene Ward for this open seat (Oct. 25).\You correctly identify the principal reasons voters should choose Gene Ward over his opponent: extensive experience in the community, including previously representing Hawai'i Kai in the Legislature, and a broad perspective gained through national and international service, most recently as Peace Corps director in troubled East Timor.\Gene is tested, proven and well prepared to serve Hawai'i Kai again in the Legislature. Compared to a novice newcomer, the choice should be clear, and The Advertiser has it right.\RICHARD W. BAKER | Hawai'i Kai\Bicycle league backs Charter amendment 8\Regarding The Honolulu Advertiser's ""no"" endorsement of Charter amendment 8 (Oct. 23), we at the Hawaii Bicycling League respectfully disagree.\The City Charter is the correct venue as it provides an opportunity for registered voters on O'ahu to determine how their city is governed. The Charter is reviewed every 10 years and amended in the interim. What better way to institute long-term policy? Should Honolulu become pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly in the next 10 years and this policy becomes irrelevant, it can be removed the next time around.\Passing Charter amendment 8 is not a magic bullet. Advocates, citizens, representatives, and enlightened government employees will still need to push for specific funding, designs, education, enforcement, etc., but that is no reason not to change the Charter. Yes on Charter amendment 8!\KRISTI SCHULENBERG | Executive director, Hawaii Bicycling League\TRANSIT\Higher gas tax could finance bus expansion\To solve the traffic congestion problem on O'ahu, you have to take individual cars off the road. Building more roads and adding more lanes to freeways won't solve the problem - the more roads, the more vehicles.\Toll roads won't help, because the majority of folks won't pay the toll to drive on the roads, just as the majority of drivers don't carpool.\Rail won't solve the problem, because it is too expensive for everybody, and it serves just the few.\Here is the solution: Raise the cost of gasoline to $5 a gallon. The extra tax would be used to subsidize the city bus program.\This tax would add more buses and neighborhood transit buses/trolleys to connect to major bus stops. It would also be used to lower the cost of the regular pass, similar to what senior citizens pay.\I did observe that when gas hit almost $4 a gallon, there were fewer cars on the road, and more people carpooled.\Although not an easy decision, it's time we do the right thing.\PATTI M. INADA | Honolulu\ADJUNCT TO DEFENSE\Benefit to be gained in commitment to peace\Despite what Edward Gutteling (Letters, Oct. 27) and others have implied, there is neither danger nor dishonor in seeking peace. As a nation and as individuals, we should share a commitment to standing as models of human decency.\The proposed Department of Peace, which has gained the support of Congressman Neil Abercrombie and Democratic candidate Mazie Hirono, would not promote peace to the detriment of defense; it would support peace as an adjunct to defense. It would also develop programs that would teach alternatives to violence and encourage future generations to address their differences in more productive and less destructive ways.\Simultaneously promoting peace and maintaining a strong defense is no different than modern medical science focusing on both maintaining health and fighting disease. They are two sides of the same coin.\Every day, we see the terrible price we pay for being too anxious to resort to war. Yes, there will always be times when we will need a strong defense.\But we must also recognize that there are many more times when we would benefit from a commitment to peace.\DONNIE TORRES | Pearl City\SCHOOLS\Irony seen in BOE's grade for Hamamoto\It is ironic that Board of Education Chairman Randall Yee stated that School Superintendent Pat Hamamoto is doing a terrific job, while the board rated her performance as satisfactory.\Are we satisfied with relative mediocrity? Maybe we need a new chairman as well as a new school superintendent.\RICK TUBANIA | 'Aiea\EYESORE\Graffiti a problem on Plolo stream walls\We have graffiti problems on the Plolo stream walls. It starts under the bridge by the Plolo Fire Station and it goes all the way down.\What can we do to clean it up? I wish that all the people who live next to the river would listen to sounds, such as the dogs barking, because that is when the people come to graffiti the walls.\LAVERNE NEKOTA | Honolulu\FOOTBALL TEAM\Two UH athletes show true sportsmanship\In an era in which individualism and self-aggrandizement in sports are lauded, it is refreshing to hear about the humility and self-deprecating actions of Ross Dickerson and Ryan Grice-Mullins.\Both surrendered their talents to each other, leading to the success of the University of Hawai'i Warrior football team.\This past Saturday, both athletes displayed a commitment to team achievement over individual gain. Seldom do you hear of athletes wanting to give up their starting roster spots and playing time to another. Each exemplified the virtue of wanting the other to succeed, and abdicating his chance to be in the starting spotlight. The result was that Ross and Ryan played terrific games.\I commend them for demonstrating leadership, sportsmanship and humbleness. I would also like to acknowledge the community of people who raised these gentlemen into the type of student athletes we aspire to have.\Thank you to the parents of Ryan and Ross, coach June Jones, and athletic director Herman Frazer.\RESTI PAGUIRIGAN | Pearl City\EARTHQUAKE\Hotels, tour firms must have first-aid kits\My wife and I recently vacationed at Keauhou Bay on the Big Island. We were having breakfast when the earthquake hit at 7:08 a.m.\In the aftermath, my wife had a mild cut on her leg. I asked at the hotel desk for a first-aid kit, but they said they did not have one.\I asked Jack's Tour Co. bus driver and a Polynesian Cultural Tour bus driver, and was told the same thing.\With all the tourists that come to the Islands, how can companies be so ill prepared? What would Hawai'i do if there had been a real emergency?\DEREK PRIEST | McCalla, Ala.\DRUGS\Hawai'i Rx reducing cost of prescriptions\Two recent letters in The Advertiser (Oct. 21, 23) mistakenly downplayed the effectiveness of the Hawai'i Rx Plus program in reducing prescription drug prices for low- and middle-income residents.\This free program offered by the state Department of Human Services is producing substantial price breaks for families and individuals.\According to statistics for September, Hawai'i Rx Plus members saved more than 34 percent on generic drug purchases and more than 14 percent on brand-name medications. That means the 2,074 members who used the discount program in September saved a total of $25,243. Through the first nine months of the year, Hawai'i residents have saved more than $271,000.\DHS will work closely with the Legislature during its next session, with the goal of producing even greater price breaks for consumers who do not have insurance coverage for prescription drugs and earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid.\Signing up for Hawai'i Rx Plus is easy. Just call (877) 677-1892 toll-free or visit the Web site at www.hawaii.gov/dhs/dhs/rx_plus. The program is available to any resident whose income does not exceed 350 percent of the federal poverty level ($39,480 for a single person or $80,508 for a family of four).\Reducing the costs of health care and improving the quality and availability of medical services are among the top priorities of the Lingle-Aiona administration. Hawai'i Rx Plus is an important part of that effort.\LILLIAN KOLLER | Director, state Department of Human Services\MAINTENANCE\Work on Pu'uloa Road is taking far too long\Is Pu'uloa Road being completed by the state or a private contractor?\It seems that in the past three years I have driven on the same bumpy one lane and seen three people working on it at one time. You would think that such a vital link between Moanalua Freeway and Nimitz Highway would have been completed in a much speedier fashion. By the time one side gets finished, the other side will be old and bumpy.\The state of Hawai'i must look into this. All I would like to see is the road completed. Thanks, and please fill the potholes.\J. SHARP | Honolulu"

44,"LEGISLATURE\Voters bear the blame for our many woes\The next time you feel the need to complain about your sky-high taxes, bad traffic conditions with no resolution in sight or the terrible conditions of Hawai'i's schools, realize that the blame falls at your feet. You have no one to blame but yourself for the people you have elected, time and time again.\I have been around a lot of places and never have I seen such a one-sided monolithic makeup of a state Legislature. And you are actually surprised when your taxes go up? A Democrat never saw a tax hike he did not like.\These problems have not just come out of nowhere. Thankfully, we are here for only a couple of years.\It is often said that if you keep doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result, you must be crazy. Either that or you are a Democrat in the state Legislature.\AARON WOLF | Kapolei\BILL 71\Bus ban on cell-phone ringtones is ridiculous\The City Council passed Bill 71, which bans cell-phone ringtones on the bus. It has yet to be signed by the mayor.\The idea of banning cell-phone ringtones on the bus is ridiculous, and is an overreaction to something that is extremely minor.\The bus isn't a library, a classroom or a private space for meditation.\If we ban cell-phone rings, what next? Do we ban all conversations between passengers?\Also, if someone who is in a hurry to go to work (or another appointment) and forgot to put the phone on vibrate, that person will suffer the humiliation of being expelled from the bus.\And that person will suffer just for the sake of petty tyrants who complain about extremely minor issues!\We need to encourage Mayor Mufi Hanneman to veto Bill 71.\PABLO WEGESEND | Honolulu\PRACTICING PRINCIPLE\Lt. Watada engaged in practice of living aloha\Some two dozen of us, mostly people of Hawaiian ancestry, met for lunch with Lt. Ehren Watada and his parents on Dec. 14.\The revelation came not from what he shared with us, but what his mother stated during the talk story. Mrs. Watada stood with her husband and her stepson because, as she stated, she believed that he was doing the ""right thing."" He stood on principle. And she stood beside him.\Hawaiians can relate to the idea of standing on principles. We stand on the principle of aloha, among others just as valuable. As we have always welcomed others to our land - to share our water, our resources, our sense of kuleana and rightness - we continue to extend those principles to those outside our own ethnic community.\From our point of view, practice is what connects integrity to principle. We try not to talk aloha without practicing it. And while those who immigrated here have mostly been driven by other schemes, some have come to understand and appreciate the beauty of concepts based on sharing and caring and respect for the well-being of others.\This is why Lt. Watada's clear statements against the war in Iraq make sense. Whether he understands or not, he is presently engaged in the practice of aloha. He extends his care and respect to those whose lives are on the line on all sides in a horrible, far-reaching war that impacts thousands: a war that leaves us, to this day, uncertain of the ""benefits,"" if any.\For those Hawai'i residents who sport the ""Live Aloha"" bumper stickers on their cars, I hope they think about what it means to live aloha. There is no place in that concept that allows for the killing of others and the destruction of their homes and homeland. Hawaiians know how that feels, as we live with the consequences of historical bad actions every day. Nonetheless, we also attempt to overcome that negativity by practicing what makes sense. Lt. Watada's actions, seen in that light, make sense and I support his efforts to live aloha.\LYNETTE HI'ILANI CRUZ | Assistant professor of anthropology, Hawai'i Pacific University\Vietnam War ended after support was lost\After the Tet offensive in Vietnam, morale around the war began a free fall. Soldiers stood in solidarity and defied orders to deploy and to fight. Eventually, politicians couldn't continue a war that they didn't have soldiers to fight, and the quagmire ended.\What we call those troops brave enough to risk a court-martial varies depending on politics, but today we have a new quagmire. Lt. Ehren Watada defied deployment orders to Iraq and faces a court-martial. He volunteered to serve in 2003.\He is the type of troop we must support.\C. ALLEN | New York City\KAMEHAMEHA DECISION\Applaud judges who see Pauahi's vision\For those who believe the Kamehameha Schools' admission policy is unjust due to racial discrimination, visit the campus and take a good look at the student body.\Students of every ethnicity are represented: Caucasian, Asian, African-American, Pacific Islander and every mixture imaginable. The common thread is that as Native Hawaiians they represent a demographic group with the worst statistics in the state.\If the trust were opened to all, it could not serve its focused purpose to improve the lives of citizens most destined for public assistance, unemployment, crime, drug addiction and incarceration.\Not only would the public school system be further strained, but such a decision would prove to be a greater burden on society in general.\I applaud those judges who see Pauahi's vision. And if you don't like it, build your own private school with your own money rather than trying to benefit from someone else's charity.\MATTHEW KAOPIO JR. | 'Ewa\PROPOSITION 13\Government must listen to the people\We totally agree with Whitlow Au's letter (Dec. 20), ""Hawai'i homeowners need a Proposition 13.""\Furthermore, we believe that the government is ""of the people, by the people, and for the people"" and that we should take the ""bull by the horns"" with a Proposition 13. It is time the government listens to the people!\MIKE AND LYNN HASCALL | Kailua\SPEEDING\Tougher laws will cut traffic accident deaths\A number of letters have said that ticketing of speeders by the police department has not helped slow traffic deaths.\That conclusion is correct. Ticketing merely brings the matter of speeding to the attention of the one caught speeding.\If we are serious about stopping road carnage, then it is the lawmakers who need to be told how we feel. The laws in place today do nothing to encourage safety, and often encourage disobedience.\If you are caught driving drunk, you immediately become a pedestrian for at least six months. Second time, for at least two years; and if there is a third time, you become a pedestrian for the rest of your life.\If you are caught speeding, you immediately become a pedestrian for at least six months. Second time, for at least one year; and if there is a third time, you are a pedestrian for the rest of your life.\If you are caught driving after any such conviction, the vehicle is forfeited to the county - no matter who the registered owner is.\Pass a few laws like that and the fatalities will all but disappear.\DAVE REED | Honolulu\INOUYE\Little regard shown for Hawai'i environment\It was with great disappointment that I read Sen. Dan Inouye's commentary, ""Don't fence them in"" (Dec. 17).\Following his vote to open the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, it is clear how little regard he has for the fragile environments of Hawai'i and Alaska and those who fight to protect them.\The Stryker brigades may be important for national defense, but the impact they would have on Hawai'i's limited space is far greater than on the vastness of the Mainland.\Furthermore, his use of the same scare tactics this administration has used to manipulate us into an unresolvable military and political situation is not what one would hope for in a Democratic senator of his stature.\MICHAEL ZUCKER | Palolo\CITY\Thank taxpayers for strong revenue growth\In a press release on Dec. 19, our mayor took great pride in the just-released Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.\In part, the report says the city strengthened its financial position over the previous fiscal year because of strong revenue growth. Revenues rose $124 million to $1.4186 billion for fiscal year 2006, mainly because of increases in real property and other taxes and in sewer revenues.\I rest my case.\JASON KOKAAINA | Waipahu\GOVERNMENT\We're being taxed and priced out of Hawai'i\The property-tax increases, high gas prices and a raise in the general excise tax, coupled with higher gas tax come Jan. 1 -how much more can we sacrifice to maintain some sort of quality of life? Not to mention, HECO wants to raise its rates.\Our local government needs to figure out something to stop the hole in our pockets from getting bigger. These raises and increases are going to push locals to find a more affordable place to live. Not to mention, possibly add to the ""houseless"" population.\Having to pay one of highest prices in the nation for gasoline, milk, cereal or whatever, because of our ""geographical isolation, no or little competition, etc."" is like kicking people when they're already down. Where's the aloha?\Our local governments need to get a handle on things. The people they work for and represent are being taxed and priced outta Hawai'i.\BRENT CATEKISTA | Kapolei"

Big business, big labor just doing what they do
\
Leah Horowitz's and Jack Arnest's letters to the editor on Oct. 7, venting against the paving over of Hawaii, are typical of dozens I read every month.
\
Most blame those ""greedy"" corporations and construction companies. None ever blame the unions who are just as happy to see these cement trucks keep on rolling. And it's the unions that have the muscle to send out their minions to the various precincts to get out the vote for compliant politicians.
\
But I truly can't blame big business or big unions for turning Hawaii into a concrete Los Angeles. That's just what they do. Big business has to keep on growing to survive, and unions have to keep on supplying jobs.
\
The problem rests at the door of our elected officials. They appoint the agencies and regulators. They accept the endorsements and contributions from these unions, engineering firms and contractors. You keep voting the same people back into office and expect a different outcome, so stop complaining.

It's demeaning to call people 'scavengers'
\
Regarding the Kokua Line column, ""Turn in human scavengers, says city's recycling honcho"" (Star-Advertiser, Kokua Line, Oct. 15):
\
First, it is inappropriate to refer to our presumably homeless and low-income population as ""human scavengers.""
\
Second, is ""stealing from taxpayers"" a mischaracterization?
\
The city and state are quick to boast about our beverage container deposit program, with a 76 percent return rate and the added value of helping to keep our streets and beaches free of litter. However, almost none of our city streets or beach parks offer municipal recycling bins. This high rate of redemption would not be possible without so-called scavengers. Sure, it is illegal for someone to disturb private refuse bins without permission, but the city and state should be making recycling effortless and uncomplicated. That would be a truly progressive approach.

State should monitor debris for radiation
\
Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawaii (BEACH) had no choice but to cancel two upcoming marine debris removal events in Kahuku because there has been no checking for radiation on those beaches by the state Department of Health and, in fact, no checking for radiation on any beach on Oahu, Hawaii island and Lanai known for accumulation of marine debris.
\
BEACH will not put any volunteers' health at risk and has asked DOH for help in monitoring radiation at the beach of marine debris. It will not do it because the cleanups are on Saturdays.
\
The claim by government agencies that the debris missed being contaminated because it went out to sea before the explosions is false. Some 80 percent of the fallout went out to sea where the debris was. Elevated levels of radiation were measured on a U.S. warship 100 miles off the coast of Japan.

True cost of blunder not really being told
\
With all the talk about the Wonder Blunder costing $1.1 million, why is everyone neglecting to include the salaries of the dozens of state employees who are spending their time on this?
\
It goes from the clerks and secretaries who do the legwork all the way up to and including the governor; all are paid by the taxpayers.
\
$1.1 million, indeed! It's probably closer to $2 million.

Have students grow food at isle schools
\
A government-appointed task force plans to identify public school land that could be leased or developed for revenue (""Panel surveys school land for possible profit,"" Star-Advertiser, Oct. 13).
\
My suggestion is to lease the land to grow food.Doing so would provide farming jobs (considered one of the up-and-coming careers), increase ""green"" corridors in urban environments, serve our communities with local fresh food and provide a much-needed educational and nutritional component to our children's educations.
\
The land could be leased to local farmers or nonprofits that are willing to incorporate students from the schools, using a student workforce, or selling the harvests through a school-run farmers market.
\
Public schools are located in every community and we all need to eat. Why not grow the freshest, most local food possible at our schools, a truly efficient farm-to-table concept?

Lingle, Djou, Crowley betray conservatives
\
Racially dividing our lands and people is so dangerous to Hawaii it outweighs national economic issues - remember Bosnia, Rwanda and Sri Lanka?
\
Former Gov. Linda Lingle, Charles Djou and Kawika Crowley all favor the Akaka Bill. So I'm asking conservative Republicans to vote for their Democrat opponents.
\
Senate Republicans have blocked the Akaka Bill for 12 years. Lingle spent eight years pushing the Akaka Bill as her top federal priority. Lingle loudly proclaimed that she would work inside her Republican Senate caucus to get them to stop blocking it.
\
Hirono also favors the Akaka Bill, but Republicans will ignore her. Vote for Hirono.
\
Djou excitedly proclaimed on OHA radio he could persuade fellow Republicans to vote for the Akaka Bill and racial entitlements.
\
Maybe so. Vote for Hanabusa.
\
Republican national and state platforms both oppose the Akaka Bill. Lingle, Djou and Crowley have abandoned Republican principles. Conservatives can abandon those candidates without guilt.

It seems Republicans can't handle the truth
\
Recently, the Republicans were accusing pollsters of manipulating data to show that the president is leading in the presidential race.
\
Now, some Republicans express skepticism on the veracity of the employment report (""Jobs data draw claims of conspiracy,"" Star-Advertiser, Oct. 6), which shows a significant drop in the unemployment rate. They insinuate that the Obama administration conspired to manipulate the unemployment data, a notion that U.S. Labor Department officials and several conservatives dismiss as preposterous.
\
The Republicans seem to have difficulty in handling the truth.
\
The latest jobs report indicates that the economy has regained its footing and is heading toward a robust recovery. Such a report provides a sense of optimism for all job seekers.
\
Therefore, if the Republicans truly care about the economy, they should join others in hailing the economic report instead of peddling ludicrous conspiracy theories.

As a senior I do not want anyone tampering with my Social Security, Medicare and the Obamacare health plan, and to put it all at risk with drastic changes.

People vote their pockets, jobs and the economy. We seniors have the right to look after our own interests and the rights of Social Security, Medicare and health care.

FROM THE FORUM
\
""Public's unease magnified by big UH salaries,"" Star-Advertiser, Oct. 15:
\
-- It's one thing to have great educational credentials, but the perception the public has of these individuals is of arrogance and high-and-mighty attitudes. I'm sure that if they were more humble and sincere and demonstrated that they care about the university (and not their pocketbooks), the public would be more accepting. Right now, there are a million reasons why these administrators are not respected.
\
-- The University of Hawaii has pockets of excellence university-wide, but on balance, its administrators do not deserve the compensation of leaders in America's top research universities.
\

\
""The name game,"" Star-Advertiser, Oct. 15:
\
-- Unfortunately, most all of these cases will affect women. Producing documents does nothing! My Social Security card is in my name but I was told by the state ID office I would have to bring in a certified copy of my divorce decree to renew the state ID. More fees paid out of my Social Security earnings! Total shibai!
\
-- As time goes by, the government passes new laws and creates new bureaucracies and forces the people to jump through more hoops and pay more fees and taxes to do what used to be free. Look how the Transportation Security Administration has changed air travel forever. At some point we will have to revolt against our government, scrap the current system and start over, because government never makes anything easier. It only gets worse over time.
\
-- This isn't a Hawaii thing. This law is to comply with the federal REAL ID Act which was signed into law in 2005 by then-President George W. Bush to combat terrorism and illegal immigration.
\
-- It seems like the terrorists have accomplished their goal, if it was to make life as an American citizen much more difficult.
\

\
""Council wants special-funds power,"" Star-Advertiser, Oct. 16:
\
-- There are actually good reasons for establishing special funds, and they usually involve more accountability and ensuring that the money collected from a specific tax (i.e., gas tax) is used for the purpose it was intended (i.e., road maintenance).
\
-- With exception of the rail fund, I can't think of a single ""special fund"" that hasn't been raided by our politicians. ""Special fund"" is right next to ""temporary tax"" as phrases that let you know you are being lied to.
\
-- I think the intent is to keep the administration from redirecting those funds. You can have all the funds you could ever imagine, but if the bulk of the revenue gets redirected to the general fund, then that ain't good.
\
---
\
""Synthetic drugs confiscated on Kauai,"" Star-Advertiser, Oct. 17:
\
-- They need to do that on Oahu, too.
\
-- Why do we have shops that can legally sell drug paraphernalia? It's like allowing the sale of guns and making bullets illegal. These laws need to be fixed so that they are congruent to the goals at hand. At the current time, these laws that allow the sale of drug paraphernalia are, at best, questionable.
\
-- I do not condone the use of illegal substances, but I believe that marijuana in itself should not be illegal. It was used for many centuries for medicinal purposes. It has even been used by religious groups for centuries. My question is: How we can have vodka and other volatile substances as legal recreational drugs (that's what they are) and yet we make marijuana illegal?
\

\
""Trucking company faces fine, bill for bridge repair,"" Star-Advertiser, Oct. 18:
\
-- Didn't the driver know the maximum height requirement to pass the bridge? Truck drivers are supposed to know how tall their rig is.
\
-- Obviously your question has been answered by the bridge section laying on the ground.
\
-- The driver was lucky. His or her careless mistake could have resulted in a tragedy.
\
-- His insurance will not pay for the repairs due to his lack of obtaining the necessary permit. If he can't pay, he will file for bankruptcy and start another company under another name. That's how the game is played, folks.
\
-- An oversight can destroy a business.
\
---
\
""Firing gun at vehicle on H-1 gets Kakaako man probation,"" Star-Advertiser, Oct. 18:
\
-- So I can react in public by pulling out a gun and shooting it at someone and get only probation? Awesome.
\
-- Carrying a firearm without a permit. Discharging a weapon in public. Endangerment. And... probation? Check, please.

Do something for Planet Earth
\
April 22 is a day designated for every person to do something that shows care for our planet. It takes only a moment to recall what you've heard, read about and personally seen to realize how much we take the resources and beauty of our planet for granted.
\
Every person can do something on Earth Day. You can participate in a beach cleanup, drive less, invest in solar energy, dispose of trash in the trash can, improve your environmental awareness, recycle and e-cycle, support local agriculture, educate your family, friends and colleagues about how to take care of the environment, buy and use fewer plastic products, use less water, don't throw your cigarette butts where you're standing, support businesses that advocate and demonstrate environmental awareness, use reusable grocery bags, repair rather than trash items ... so many ways!

Don't dumb down school standards
\
Don Horner, chairman of the newly appointed state Board of Education, said the goal of BOE members is ""simply to leave education better than we found it."" Apparently, they would be satisfied with any small improvement.
\
Horner's uninspiring attitude is contrasted by a letter from a public school student, Courtney Kamiya (""Diploma plans give students easy way out,"" Letters, Star-Advertiser, April 17). She opposes the decision by the old BOE to create two types of diplomas, one that is less rigorous than the current diploma.
\
Believing that most students would opt for that one, she says that students shouldn't be ""dummied down,"" but should instead be raised up.
\
If Horner is truly speaking for the entire BOE, its members should begin listening to students like Kamiya. The BOE must set high goals in order to lead Hawaii's public education system out of its current deplorable condition.

Budget cuts hurt many in society
\
What if your sister was being beaten by her husband, and there was no shelter?
\
What if you heard the screams of a child next door being abused, and there was no one to report it to?
\
What if your long-lost uncle turned up homeless and severely mentally ill, but there were no services to help him?
\
What if your friend didn't have health insurance, but she couldn't get medical care at a community health center because of budget cuts?
\
What if there was no adult day care program for your 86-year-old grandmother? Or if daily meals were no longer delivered to her when she became homebound?
\
This is how budget cuts hurt us and those we love.

Stop piling on taxes and fees
\
Listening to Mayor Peter Carlisle state the importance of supporting the Hawaii Foodbank's latest food drive -- because people don't have money for food -- made me think of some ways he could do more for the needy than just collect canned goods at the side of the road.
\
Maybe he could stop the rail project and save each family $450 per year.
\
Maybe he could ease up on our raising car registration fees (I paid $43 more this year than last) and his proposal to increase the gas tax. Or maybe he could think again about growing the city's budget by 6.3 percent as well as the accompanying tax increases that will be required.
\
Yes, Mr. Mayor, Hono­lulu's families are hurting. And they're hurting because of the increased taxes and fees that government entities at all levels continue to pile upon them.
\
Stop taking from them and let people manage their own budgets.

Water polo team deserves an A
\
I was touched by your article about the Farrington High School water polo team (""Farrington water polo team scores with perseverance,"" Star-Advertiser, April 17).
\
The girls who make up this team are winners in my book, and they showed what everyone who has ever played sports knows in the core of their being.
\
That is, sports isn't about only the wins you put up on the board, but also the tenacity, sacrifice, dedication, hard work and team-first concept that is paramount when doing something together for a common goal. The girls learned valuable lessons about themselves and about life, and I know as they make a great future for themselves, they will always take how well they prepared for these lessons with them.
\
Give those girls and their coach an A.

Taxpayers should be 'most favored'
\
Economic transactions come to an equilibrium when the purchaser of the service finds the price acceptable and the provider of the service finds the price sufficient.
\
Most-favored-nations clauses violate that equilibrium since the salaries move upward without further negotiating. The negotiator for the payor, in this case the governor, violates his fiduciary duty to the real payor -- the taxpayer -- with a most-favored-nation clause for the Hawaii Government Employees Association.
\
Maybe an alternative would be for the salaries and benefits to change to a level more favorable to the payors when that is available. Why should most-favored-nation clauses go only one way? Why are the taxpayers not the most favored nation to the governor?

\

\
Hawaii residents pay some of the highest income taxes in the nation and should be gradually reduced; we also pay a regressive gross excise tax on everything, including food and medicine, which should be reduced then eliminated on these items.

No. A rail system is not the singular solution for increased traffic and congestion, particularly without ""smart growth"" planning or designated funding for operations and maintenance. The Superferry, if managed efficiently, can benefit families and have a positive economic impact.
\
Should taxes be cut? Please explain your answer.

Yes, and I voted against the GET for a rail system. Hawaii's tax structure needs revision to efficiently utilize taxes, positively impact job creation, systematically improve the business tax climate, and support working families to have a quality of life.

\
Should taxes be cut? Please explain your answer.
\
Eliminate the 4 percent general excise tax on grocery food because it penalizes low-income, large and local families. Very few states tax food. Proponents of the GET say tourists pay 25 percent, but I see very few tourists in our supermarkets.

I support both, but only with a clear plan. We owe the public an explanation on routes, ridership, and costs before asking them to pay for these alternatives. No one goes to a bank for financing without a business plan.
\
Should taxes be cut? Please explain your answer.
\
This year we started by giving the public $50 million in tax cuts. We need to improve our neglected infrastructure, then return the surplus to taxpayers. We should also end tax credits and exemptions that enrich special interests.

Do you support a rail-transit system for Oahu? What about the Superferry?
\
My hope is to eventually support a rail that can work for Oahu. I have not been convinced it will reduce traffic or have the ridership to help support the cost. The price tag and route have not been finalized.
\
Should taxes be cut? Please explain your answer.
\
There is room for tax relief. High cost of living has social consequences. The economy is doing well, the jobless rate is very low, tax collections are up, yet we have unprecedented numbers in homelessness and Hawaii lacks affordable housing.

\

The 1998 personal income tax cuts were a good start, but we also need to expand the low- to middle- income tax brackets. While not a state issue, I fully support providing the elderly with more real property tax exemptions.

A rail-transit system will reduce the amount of cars on the road at commute time and paying the high cost of parking downtown. The Superferry will provide affordable travel for families, farmers, and transporting supplies and material to all islands.
\
Should taxes be cut? Please explain your answer.
\
A tax reduction should be enacted for lower-income workers. Property tax should also be lowered for owners who live in their residence. Many older people are paying more in taxes than what their mortgage was when they purchased it.

"
48,"Restrictions placed on employment and travel, but no layoffs expected\A hiring freeze is one of a series of cost-saving measures the city is implementing in light of declining tax revenues.\""These are tough economic times, and the city needs to take steps to ensure that essential city services are maintained and that the needs of our residents are met. This is the time to focus only on what we need to have,"" said Bill Brennan, press secretary for Mayor Mufi Hannemann. ""Despite declining revenues, we will not tighten our belt to the extent that public safety is jeopardized. Our city will remain the safest major city in the country.""\In addition to the hiring freeze, the city has said there will be:\- No creation of new positions;\- No reorganizations or promotions that will result in higher-paying job classifications;\- No travel, except for legal requirements such as depositions, professional certifications or licensure, and collective bargaining negotiation;\- No unbudgeted leases or purchase of equipment;\- No unbudgeted leasing of office/storage space or subsidized employee parking;\- Limits on the transfer of lapsed budgets between quarters.\The restrictions were outlined in a memo sent to all city departments Nov. 6 and are the latest belt-tightening moves by the city. In July, the city asked department heads to trim up to 3 percent of their operating budgets for fiscal year 2009. That would amount to $54 million of the $1.8 billion operating budget.\No additional restrictions are anticipated and no city workers will be laid off, according to Mary P. Waterhouse, director of the city department of Budget and Fiscal Services. Capital projects are not affected, with the ongoing emphasis on sewer infrastructure and transit still intact.\""In the current fiscal year 2009 budget, real property valuations are based on the assessments made as of Oct. 1, 2007. The fiscal year 2010 budget will encompass some of the impact of declining home prices, but the full impact of declining home sale prices will not be realized until the fiscal year 2011 budget,"" Waterhouse said. ""The city is anticipating a severe downturn in fiscal year 2011 and is trying to cut expenses now to avoid drastic cuts to programs and services in the future.""\REVENUES DECLINING\The projections are based on declining revenues because of an array of factors, from plummeting visitor arrivals to a decline in property values.\For example, the city's gas tax revenues for the first six months of 2008 are down $3.63 million from the same period last year, according to the state Department of Taxation. Honolulu collects 16.5 cents on every gallon of gas sold on O'ahu.\How each department will adjust to the spending restrictions is still being debated, with the Budget and Fiscal Services Department leaving the window open for appeals.\""Typically what happens in times of sagging economies, government looks at the capital program to provide some relief but that's all in discussion right now,"" said Eugene C. Lee, director of the city Department of Design and Construction. ""It's definitely not pretty, but its something that has happened before and we'll have to figure out how to deal with it.""\If property values are down when next year's assessments come out in December and spending remains the same, an increase in tax rates may follow.\Last year, the total assessed value of residential property on O'ahu decreased for the first time in six years, falling 2.7 percent.\A UNIQUE CRISIS\Downturns in the economy are nothing new, and the city has faced economic troubles in past market cycles.\The state felt the economic pinch in the early 1990s and again after Sept. 11, 2001, but rebounded after the global economy strengthened and consumer habits improved, said Jack P. Suyderhoud, a professor of business economics at the University of Hawai'i's Shidler College of Business.\The current crisis however, is unique, Suyderhoud said, because companies, individuals and municipal governments will be less able to rely on debt to support their spending. That means the growth in consumer and business spending will not be as robust as it was in previous economic expansions.\""The revenue shortfall is very real. For city government, the coffers are not going to fill up as fast as they did in the past in the current low-growth environment. The visitor arrival numbers look dismal through 2009. It's going to be 2010 before the economy gets better, and its going to be the fiscal year 2011 before the city budget gets much better. This is a different animal we're dealing with.""\DIFFERENT OUTLOOKS\There are differing views among Honolulu City Council members about how the Hannemann administration is dealing with the budget issues.\The council will help with city finances to the extent that it can, said council chairman Todd K. Apo. It may be time to return to discussions about relaxing the rules to gain access to a fund that supports vacant, funded positions, he said.\""If there are places that the council believes can be dealt with from a policy position that can help the city with the economic situation, then we will be looking at that,"" Apo said. ""Hopefully, there is room and discussion for those types of situations.""\City Councilman Charles K. Djou said the need to make drastic budget adjustments would not be necessary if the size of government had not grown as much as it has.\""I think the initial steps are good. The hiring freeze and the stops on travel, no promotions, I'm supportive of it,"" Djou said. ""We might even have to go deeper if the fiscal outlook continues to worsen. I have long held that our government is too big and we're spending too much.""\The economic downturn is being felt by municipalities from New York to Los Angeles, as well as the federal government.\New York City is facing a $2.8 billion budget shortfall, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is asking city departments to cut spending by 5.6 percent. In January, Phoenix reported the need to trim more than $70 million from its budget by June 2009 to compensate for shortfalls.\Reach Peter Boylan at 535-8110 or pboylan@honoluluadvertis er.com.\Pull-quote:\""I think the initial steps are good.

Taxpayers pay for homeless
\
Regarding Alvin Murphy's letter, how very sad that the homeless would have to pay $200 to reclaim their belongings taken by the authorities (""Policymakers should try living on the streets,"" Star-Advertiser, Letters, March 3).
\
This wouldn't happen if the homeless didn't just assume they have the right to park themselves on city sidewalks, bus stop benches and doorways, paid for by taxpayers.
\
It seems to me the $200 is necessary to at least partially defray the cost of the homeless on the city.Does anyone notice?They so often have money for cigarettes and liquor.
\
Rather than going to one of the many shelters (never filled because they can't take their drugs and alcohol with them), they prefer squatting anywhere and everywhere, using our parks and landscaping as toilets, and dumping their trash everywhere.Someone has to clean up after them, and it won't happen for free.

UH doesn't need another study
\
More proof of incompetence from University of Hawaii President M.R.C. Greenwood, the Board of Regents and UH staff involved with the Wonder fiasco. An audit, external or internal, will only produce a written report saying what should be done to prevent such an occurrence in the future.
\
Is this needed? No! There already exists policy and procedural documentation within the UH procurement system that should have prevented this situation. It happened because the existing policies and procedures were not followed.
\
What is needed is a legal body with subpoena powers to enforce the production of applicable documentation identifying the people involved in the procurement system violations. This would not cost anywhere near $260,000 and it would reveal those who should be fired for cause.

Publicly funded elections needed
\
Mahalo for your editorial in support of publicly funded elections (""Partial publicly funded elections worth trying out,"" Star-Advertiser, Our View, March 2).
\
It is difficult to estimate the long-term price we all pay for elections controlled by corporate interests, but I think it must be at least a hundred times the cost of publicly funded elections.
\
For example, what is the long-term price of allowing Monsanto and Syngenta to use toxic chemicals on large areas of Hawaii agricultural land? A Legislature not controlled by corporations would certainly require labeling, but it would not stop there. It would also levy a heavy tax on pesticides and herbicides.

Puna residents deserve better
\
Those oppressed can be just as guilty of racism as those who oppress.
\
But what is most disturbing about state Rep. Faye Hanohano's behavior is that the presence of artwork initiated her outburst. What can we expect from her with more serious problems and challenges our state faces?
\
I was a Puna resident for 10 years and still own a home there. I am most sad that someone of Hanohano's character now represents the fine citizens of Puna. They deserve better.
\
As a linguist and an interpreter, I would suggest that the Legislature hire a qualified professional interpreter when Hanohano uses Hawaiian, an official state language, in her work. Interpreters serve these needs throughout the world. A simultaneous interpretation is not only more efficient in terms of time, but it is bad practice for an individual to interpret for himself/herself.

I think people are taking Rep. Faye Hanohano's remarks too seriously. Haven't we all,at some point in our lives, said something we regret?
\
Yes, it was wrong to use racial slurs, but she did apologize and her apology was accepted.Hanohano is a proud Native Hawaiian and is someone who listens to her constituents' concerns in the Puna community.
\
There are many native artists who would love to have their art recognized. Perhaps the State Foundation on Culture and the Arts should include them as well.
\
Although I am of mixed ethnic ancestry, I do have Hawaiian blood and therefore I can rightfully call myself a Native Hawaiian. It is simple: You either have it or you don't.

I am a longtime resident of Aina Haina and am grateful to live in a neighborhood where neighbors care for each other.We know each others' families and we share stories while we walk our dogs or ride the bus.We exchange bananas, mangos and mountain apples from our gardens. We delight in sighting the flock of green parrots flying overhead and watching the fairy terns swooping over the trees. It is indeed a special neighborhood.
\
Many of us have also enjoyed numerous hikes into the upper valley, a place of beauty and peace. Now this serene place is filled with noise from heavy construction equipment, scarring the aina and destroying the remaining artifacts of the Hawaiians who once cared for this land.
\
The developer, Jeff Stone, is exerting his rights to deface the land, pollute the stream with runoff and bar access to the upper valley with a gate and extensive fencing.
\
It is sad that we continue to allow this to happen, that permits for development take no account of preserving our cultural heritage and the health of our environment and our people.

WASHINGTON >> The fiscal crisis for states will persist long after the economy rebounds as states confront financial problems that include rising health care costs, underfunded pensions, ignored infrastructure needs, eroding revenues and expected federal budget cuts, according to a report issued here Tuesday by a task force of respected budget experts.
\
The severity of the long-term problems facing states is often masked by lax state budget laws and opaque accounting practices, according to the report, an independent analysis of six states released by a group calling itself the State Budget Crisis Task Force. The report said the financial collapse of 2008, which caused the most serious fiscal crisis for states since the Great Depression, exposed a number of deep-set financial challenges that will grow worse if no action is taken by national policymakers.
\
""The ability of the states to meet their obligations to public employees, to creditors and most critically to the education and well-being of their citizens is threatened,"" warned the two chairmen of the task force, Richard Ravitch, the former lieutenant governor of New York, and Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve.
\
The report added a strong dose of fiscal pessimism just as many states have seen their immediate budget pressures ease for the first time in years. It also called into question how states will be able to restore the services and jobs that they cut during the downturn, saying that the loss of jobs in prisons, hospitals, courts and agencies had been more severe than in any of the past nine recessions.
\
""This is a fundamental shift in the way governments have responded to recessions and appears to signal a willingness to 'unbuild' state government in a way that has not been done before,"" the report said, noting that court systems had cut their hours in more than a dozen states, delaying actions including divorce settlements and criminal trials.
\
The report arrived at a delicate political moment. States are deciding whether or not to expand their Medicaid programs to cover the uninsured poor as part of the new health care law - an added expense some are balking at even though the federal government has pledged to pay the full cost for the first few years and 90 percent after that. Many public-sector unions feel besieged, as states and cities from Wisconsin to San Jose, Calif., have moved to save money on pensions. And Washington's focus on deficit reduction - and a series of big budget cuts scheduled to take place after the fall election - has made cuts to state aid inevitable, many governors believe.
\
If federal grants to the states were cut by just 10 percent, the report calculated, the loss to state and local government budgets would be more than $60 billion a year - which it said would be nearly twice the size of the combined tax increases that states enacted from 2008 to 2011 in response to their deepest fiscal crisis in more than 50 years.
\
Things are worse than they appear, the report contends.
\
Even before the recession, Medicaid spending was growing faster than state revenues, and the downturn has led to even higher caseloads - making the program the biggest single share of state spending, as many states have cut aid to schools and universities.
\
States do not have enough money set aside to cover the health and retirement benefits they owe their workers. Important revenue sources are being eroded: States are losing billions of sales tax dollars to Internet sales and to an economy in which much consumer spending has shifted from buying goods to buying lightly taxed services. Gas tax revenues have not kept up with urgent infrastructure needs. And distressed cities and counties pose challenges to states.
\
While almost all states are required by law to balance their budgets each year, the report said many have relied on gimmicks and nonrecurring revenues in recent years to mask the continuing imbalance between the revenues they take in and the expenses they face in the short term and long term - and that lax accounting systems allow them to do so. The report focused on California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Texas, and Virginia, and found that all have relied on some gimmicks in recent years to balance their budgets.
\
California borrowed money several times over the past decade to generate budget cash. New York delayed paying income tax refunds one year to push the costs into the next year and raided state funds that were supposed to be dedicated to the environment, wireless network improvements and home care. New Jersey borrowed against the money it received from its share of the tobacco settlement and, along with Virginia, failed to make all of the required payments to its pension funds. Texas delayed $2 billion worth of payments by a month - pushing those expenses into the next fiscal year. Illinois has billions of dollars of unpaid bills and borrowed money to invest in its severely underfunded pension funds.
\
When desperate budget officials go looking for money to balance their budgets, they often see public pension funds as an almost irresistible pool of money. One common way of ""borrowing"" pension money is to not make each year's required government contribution. Most places use actuaries to calculate how much money they must set aside each year to cover future payments - a number known as the ""annual required contribution."" But despite the name, there is usually no enforceable law that the state or locality must pay it.
\
As a result, the task force found that from 2007 to 2011, state and local governments had shortchanged their pension plans by more than $50 billion - an amount that has nothing to do with the market losses of 2008, which caused even more harm.
\
When money is withheld from a pension fund, the arrears can start to snowball, because most states count on the money compounding at a rate of about 8 percent. Eventually the unfunded liability grows unmanageable, given all the other fiscal pressures on states and cities.
\
In addition to pensions, America's states and municipalities are estimated to have promised well more than $1 trillion in health benefits - that most have not started saving for - to their retirees. (The health costs became apparent only a few years ago, when an accounting rule was changed.)
\
Ravitch became deeply concerned about the fiscal problems of the states in 2009, after he won an emergency appointment as New York's lieutenant governor during that year's budget impasse. As he dug into financial records to devise a fiscal plan, he said, he began to see the extent to which officials had been using one-offs and accounting gimmicks year after year to make the budget seem balanced. His plan was rejected.
\
Ravitch spent the remainder of his 17-month term investigating New York State's finances on his own and trying to compare what he found with the problems emerging in other states. But he could not find what he considered an adequate source of information to document the problem, so he and Volcker decided to raise money to create one of their own. Last week, Ravitch was in Washington, presenting the task force's initial findings and recommendations to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke, and others.

I've noticed that traffic is better when UH-Manoa is not in session.\So, logic would tell you that UH-Manoa commuters make up the bulk of the traffic.

52,"With Hawai'i's economic growth projected to cool, Democratic leaders in the state House and Senate will open the 2007 legislative\session on Wednesday with hopeful themes about closing the gap between rich and poor and sustaining Hawai'i's land and culture,\but with an undercurrent of caution about new spending.\Economists have told lawmakers that growth in the current economic cycle likely peaked at the end of 2004 and is now in slow\decline. The state still expects tax revenues to increase and produce a $466 million budget surplus at the close of the budget year in\June, but lawmakers are talking about being much more selective about new spending than they were last session. Last year, the\debate was over how to spend the largest surplus in 30 years.\A tax refund is required by the state constitution this year because the surplus has exceeded state revenues by more than 5 percent for two straight years. Lawmakers also know they have to cover expected pay raises for public-worker unions who are in labor negotiations with the Lingle administration.\Democratic leaders will wait until traditional opening day speeches to announce many of the details of their legislative packages. But\in interviews, they described overarching themes of sustainability and reducing the impact of the state's high cost-of-living on working\families.\Many Democrats also said they would be more realistic when describing their agenda to the public, acknowledging that issues such as\affordable housing or alternative energy could take years to address. These won't, they caution, be wrapped up with a bow and a news\conference when the 60-day session ends in May.\'FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE'\In sessions past, after dust-ups with Gov. Linda Lingle over education reform and drug-abuse prevention, some legislators feel they left\the mistaken impression the issues were resolved when in reality the changes that were made could take years to measure.\""We're going to be fiscally conservative. Very frugal,"" state House Speaker Calvin Say, D-20th (St. Louis Heights, PA[currency] lolo Valley,\Wilhelmina Rise), said when asked about new spending. ""I don't want to go through the peaks and valleys that I did when I was\finance chairman during the recession in the 1990s.""\Say said the House is looking at a range of $25 million to $50 million in spending on tax relief. State Senate President Colleen Hanabusa, D-21st (NA[currency] nA[currency] kuli, MA[currency] kaha), did not provide a comparable dollar figure but said she doubted there was sentiment in the Senate for a large taxpayer refund. Lawmakers agreed to about $50 million in tax relief last session by expanding income tax brackets so many people would pay lower rates. They also increased the standard income tax deduction.\Lingle, in her State of the State address later this month, will likely ask the Legislature for more substantial tax relief than envisioned\by Democrats, but the debate is not expected to be as polarizing as in previous years. The governor has highlighted $128 million in\new spending on the homeless and a $30 million economic innovation plan as centerpieces of her agenda this session.\Since the constitution requires a tax refund, Democratic leaders will be under pressure to explain and defend the size of the rebate they\offer.\""The economy is slowing, so I think we should move cautiously,"" said state Senate Majority Leader Gary Hooser, D-7th (Kaua'i,\Ni'ihau). ""I don't think we should be giving away millions in tax relief.""\Lingle also has asked lawmakers to restore a general-excise tax break on gasoline blended with ethanol that expired at the end of the\year, pushing gas prices higher. Democratic leaders said the gas tax break is not in the majority packages and could cost the state too\much money to restore. But other lawmakers believe the issue may come up for consideration.\QUALITY OF LIFE\Democrats have been returning to quality-of-life themes for the past few sessions, concerned that rising housing, energy and\transportation costs are taking a toll on the poor and working class. The concept of sustainability, for the state's environment, economy\and culture, is shaping much of their thinking, even though they often struggle to connect it to specific legislation.\The priorities this year are targeted improvements in housing, alternative energy, public education, healthcare and disaster\preparedness.\""We talk a lot about sustainability, but we have to think about what that means to people,"" Hanabusa said. ""I think what people are\saying is: 'Will I be able to see my grandchildren grow up here?' ""\State House Majority Leader Kirk Caldwell, D-24th (MA[currency] noa), said lawmakers are listening to people who fear they can no longer\afford to live in the Islands. ""That's one thing that we've heard loud and clear,"" he said. ""More and more people are falling through the\cracks.""\Democrats will likely consider more direct assistance for the homeless, such as money for transitional shelters, along with easing\regulations to encourage developers to build more affordable rentals.\The majority legislative party will likely bring back a revised proposal to provide free basic health insurance for children who are not\eligible for the state's health-insurance program for the poor and are not covered by private insurance. Lingle vetoed a similar bill last\year because it might lead some parents to choose the free plan instead of paying a premium for the superior coverage offered through\the state.\THE REPUBLICAN PLAN\Democrats also may attempt to reshape the state Public Utilities Commission with the aim of making it more effective at regulating the\energy industry. Lawmakers also could take steps to ensure the PUC is pursuing transparency requirements on oil company finances\that were passed last session when a gas cap on wholesale prices was suspended. The mandate to the PUC came without any money\to make it happen.\House Republicans, whose numbers have shrunk to eight after the 2006 elections, plan to use their limited influence on charter\schools, tax relief, homeless and transitional housing needs, and renewable energy.\""We have to redefine success,"" said state House Minority Leader Lynn Finnegan, R-32nd (Lower Pearlridge, 'Aiea, HA[currency] lawa).\""Success for us is not necessarily getting bills passed. It is, in the end, did we shape public policy?""\Senate Republicans also will focus on tax relief and renewable energy, with ideas for renewable energy enterprise zones and money\for hydrogen-powered vehicles. Republicans also will propose a check on tourism growth by setting a maximum number of visitor\rooms in each county and by requiring room operators to have state licenses, which could help corral unlicensed vacation rentals.\State Senate Minority Leader Fred Hemmings, R-25th (Kailua, WaimA[currency] nalo, Hawai'i Kai), said he shares Democrats' concerns about\sustainability but said he has heard identical themes in the past without much action.\""Year in and year out, the majority party has done an excellent job of branding the session, and giving it an image, and running with\issues and making them popular,"" he said. ""It also makes for what I like to call, 'word de jour.' ""\POLITICS AT PLAY\Politics inside the House and Senate caucuses also may give Democratic leaders reason to be more cautious this session.\Hanabusa, the first woman to preside over a chamber of the Legislature, will have to shepherd the Senate's factions and establish\herself as a credible leader after years of maneuvering for the job. Hanabusa has been elevated by her run for Congress, where she\finished second in the primary to U.S. Rep. Mazie Hirono, and she is already being talked about as a potential candidate for governor\in 2010.\In the House, Say will have to manage an unwieldy caucus where a handful of dissidents are in open rebellion after failing to oust him\as speaker.\State Rep.

53,"With Hawai'i's economic growth projected to cool, Democratic leaders in the state House and Senate will open the 2007 legislative\session on Wednesday with hopeful themes about closing the gap between rich and poor and sustaining Hawai'i's land and culture,\but with an undercurrent of caution about new spending.\Economists have told lawmakers that growth in the current economic cycle likely peaked at the end of 2004 and is now in slow\decline. The state still expects tax revenues to increase and produce a $466 million budget surplus at the close of the budget year in\June, but lawmakers are talking about being much more selective about new spending than they were last session. Last year, the\debate was over how to spend the largest surplus in 30 years.\A tax refund is required by the state constitution this year because the surplus has exceeded state revenues by more than 5 percent for two straight years. Lawmakers also know they have to cover expected pay raises for public-worker unions who are in labor negotiations with the Lingle administration.\Democratic leaders will wait until traditional opening day speeches to announce many of the details of their legislative packages. But\in interviews, they described overarching themes of sustainability and reducing the impact of the state's high cost-of-living on working\families.\Many Democrats also said they would be more realistic when describing their agenda to the public, acknowledging that issues such as\affordable housing or alternative energy could take years to address. These won't, they caution, be wrapped up with a bow and a news\conference when the 60-day session ends in May.\'FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE'\In sessions past, after dust-ups with Gov. Linda Lingle over education reform and drug-abuse prevention, some legislators feel they left\the mistaken impression the issues were resolved when in reality the changes that were made could take years to measure.\""We're going to be fiscally conservative. Very frugal,"" state House Speaker Calvin Say, D-20th (St. Louis Heights, PA[currency] lolo Valley,\Wilhelmina Rise), said when asked about new spending. ""I don't want to go through the peaks and valleys that I did when I was\finance chairman during the recession in the 1990s.""\Say said the House is looking at a range of $25 million to\$50 million in spending on tax relief. State Senate President Colleen Hanabusa, D-21st (NA[currency] nA[currency] kuli, MA[currency] kaha), did not provide a\comparable dollar figure but said she doubted there was sentiment in the Senate for a large taxpayer refund. Lawmakers agreed to\about $50 million in tax relief last session by expanding income tax brackets so many people would pay lower rates. They also\increased the standard income tax deduction.\Lingle, in her State of the State address later this month, will likely ask the Legislature for more substantial tax relief than envisioned\by Democrats, but the debate is not expected to be as polarizing as in previous years. The governor has highlighted $128 million in\new spending on the homeless and a $30 million economic innovation plan as centerpieces of her agenda this session.\Since the constitution requires a tax refund, Democratic leaders will be under pressure to explain and defend the size of the rebate they\offer.\""The economy is slowing, so I think we should move cautiously,"" said state Senate Majority Leader Gary Hooser, D-7th (Kaua'i,\Ni'ihau). ""I don't think we should be giving away millions in tax relief.""\Lingle also has asked lawmakers to restore a general-excise tax break on gasoline blended with ethanol that expired at the end of the\year, pushing gas prices higher. Democratic leaders said the gas tax break is not in the majority packages and could cost the state too\much money to restore. But other lawmakers believe the issue may come up for consideration.\QUALITY OF LIFE\Democrats have been returning to quality-of-life themes for the past few sessions, concerned that rising housing, energy and\transportation costs are taking a toll on the poor and working class. The concept of sustainability, for the state's environment, economy\and culture, is shaping much of their thinking, even though they often struggle to connect it to specific legislation.\The priorities this year are targeted improvements in housing, alternative energy, public education, healthcare and disaster\preparedness.\""We talk a lot about sustainability, but we have to think about what that means to people,"" Hanabusa said. ""I think what people are\saying is: 'Will I be able to see my grandchildren grow up here?' ""\State House Majority Leader Kirk Caldwell, D-24th (MA[currency] noa), said lawmakers are listening to people who fear they can no longer\afford to live in the Islands. ""That's one thing that we've heard loud and clear,"" he said. ""More and more people are falling through the\cracks.""\Democrats will likely consider more direct assistance for the homeless, such as money for transitional shelters, along with easing\regulations to encourage developers to build more affordable rentals.\The majority legislative party will likely bring back a revised proposal to provide free basic health insurance for children who are not\eligible for the state's health-insurance program for the poor and are not covered by private insurance. Lingle vetoed a similar bill last\year because it might lead some parents to choose the free plan instead of paying a premium for the superior coverage offered through\the state.\THE REPUBLICAN PLAN\Democrats also may attempt to reshape the state Public Utilities Commission with the aim of making it more effective at regulating the\energy industry. Lawmakers also could take steps to ensure the PUC is pursuing transparency requirements on oil company finances\that were passed last session when a gas cap on wholesale prices was suspended. The mandate to the PUC came without any money\to make it happen.\House Republicans, whose numbers have shrunk to eight after the 2006 elections, plan to use their limited influence on charter\schools, tax relief, homeless and transitional housing needs, and renewable energy.\""We have to redefine success,"" said state House Minority Leader Lynn Finnegan, R-32nd (Lower Pearlridge, 'Aiea, HA[currency] lawa).\""Success for us is not necessarily getting bills passed. It is, in the end, did we shape public policy?""\Senate Republicans also will focus on tax relief and renewable energy, with ideas for renewable energy enterprise zones and money\for hydrogen-powered vehicles. Republicans also will propose a check on tourism growth by setting a maximum number of visitor\rooms in each county and by requiring room operators to have state licenses, which could help corral unlicensed vacation rentals.\State Senate Minority Leader Fred Hemmings, R-25th (Kailua, WaimA[currency] nalo, Hawai'i Kai), said he shares Democrats' concerns about\sustainability but said he has heard identical themes in the past without much action.\""Year in and year out, the majority party has done an excellent job of branding the session, and giving it an image, and running with\issues and making them popular,"" he said. ""It also makes for what I like to call, 'word de jour.' ""\POLITICS AT PLAY\Politics inside the House and Senate caucuses also may give Democratic leaders reason to be more cautious this session.\Hanabusa, the first woman to preside over a chamber of the Legislature, will have to shepherd the Senate's factions and establish\herself as a credible leader after years of maneuvering for the job. Hanabusa has been elevated by her run for Congress, where she\finished second in the primary to U.S. Rep. Mazie Hirono, and she is already being talked about as a potential candidate for governor\in 2010.\In the House, Say will have to manage an unwieldy caucus where a handful of dissidents are in open rebellion after failing to oust him\as speaker.\State Rep. Sylvia Luke, D-26th (Pacific Heights, Pauoa, Punchbowl), said the dissidents will likely become watchdogs within the\majority and, on some issues, such as ethics or tax reform, may reach out to House Republicans or Senate Democrats for leverage.\""We're going to be more of a watchdog to look for and prevent self-dealing or legislation that benefits special interests the leadership\wants to take care of,"" Luke said.\Say, according to some accounts, is upset that the dissidents plan to continue to defy his leadership. But he said he would run the\caucus transparently and is willing to hear contrary ideas.\""I'm a person who is open to constructive criticism,"" Say said.\Reach Derrick DePledge at 525-8070 or ddepledge@honoluluadvertiser.com.\Drop-in:\Starting Tuesday, view our special online report on the 2007 Hawai'i Legislature.\At HONOLULUADVERTISER.COM\Drop-in:\BY THE NUMBERS\State House and Senate party breakdown:\House: 43 Democrats; 8 Republicans\Senate: 20 Democrats; 5 Republicans\LEARN MORE\* Names and faces of the 2007 state legislature | A6, A7\* Jerry Burris details words to know this legislative session | A31"

A recent commentary about use of the Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBA) claimed that students perceive the test as ""inconsequential"" and that they ""have little incentive to take them seriously"" (""New testing regime at public schools is a recipe for disaster,"" Star-Advertiser, Island Voices, Oct. 8).
\
For Hawaii high schoolers, nothing could be further from the truth.
\
UH now uses the 11th-grade SBA results to enable direct placement into college-level courses. And 11th-grade students who are not ready for college can prepare during 12th grade. Avoiding remedial course work increases students' likelihood of timely degree completion and reduces the costs of college.
\
Over 200 colleges and universities have similar programs in California, Washington, Oregon and Nevada. This use of students' SBA scores for college placement has very real positive consequences for our high school students and helps Hawaii reach our shared ""55 by '25"" goal: that 55 percent of adults have a college degree by 2025.

Net metering yields net gains for HECO
\
Net-metering programs have helped solar energy use skyrocket across Hawaii, but unfortunately our state Public Utilities Commission has bought into Hawaiian Electric Co.'s unsubstantiated claim that rooftop solar owners don't pay their fair share to operate the electrical grid.
\
A new report from the Environment America Research & Policy Center documents independent Value of Solar studies in 11 states that found rooftop solar offered electric utilities net positive benefits, including reduced capital investment costs, avoided energy costs, and reduced environmental compliance costs.
\
In other words, utilities were underpaying rooftop solar owners, not subsidizing them, while those same customers were creating downward pressure on electric costs for all ratepayers.
\
Until barriers are removed so consumers can sell their excess power to anyone in a free-market setting, net metering is the only viable alternative. Solar power's benefits are far greater than its costs, and we should be encouraging more of it, not penalizing it.

More of tobacco tax should go to center
\
Michele Carbone, the former director of the University of Hawaii Cancer Center, argues for an increase in the cigarette tax in order to provide adequate funding for the center.
\
The alternative option, he says, is to close the center (""Options for cancer center are close it or raise cigarette tax,"" Star-Advertiser, Island Voices, Oct. 15).
\
There is a third option. Currently only one-eighth of the cigarette tax revenue goes to the cancer fund. Some of the rest is earmarked for other health initiatives, but most of the revenue flows to the state's general fund. Given the proven connection between smoking and cancer, it is very surprising to me that more of the cigarette tax revenue does not go toward cancer research.
\
Doubling the cancer fund's percentage allocation would solve the cancer center's funding problem -- and it would still be only one quarter of the total cigarette tax receipts.

Cheap heroin is all we have to show for war
\
According to Wikipedia, Afghan opium production has increased since the U.S. invasion in 2001.
\
NATO is allegedly afraid of alienating the locals by trying to eradicate this crop, which brings profits of 17 times more than food crops and requires no special storage and is drought resistant. It is estimated that 10 percent of the population is involved in opium production and transport.
\
Corruption is alleged to reach all levels of government.
\
The war in Afghanistan has so far cost American taxpayers $660 billion.
\
That amount of money could have eliminated poverty and rejuvenated our infrastructure. Now all we have is cheap heroin on our streets.

56,"By Jan TenBruggencate\Alternative energy fuels businesses\There's a lot of talk about developing alternative energy solutions in the Islands, but a few small programs are actually working to reduce the state's dependence on imported oil for power.\A shopping center in Hanalei, Kaua`i, has a 9,500-watt solar photovoltaic system on its roof, feeding its own electricity needs as well as hooking into the islandwide utility grid.\The project, installed nearly a year ago at the Hanalei Center, is one of the major net metering projects in the state, and one of a series of pr ojects throughout the Islands that are pushing the envelope on alternative energy.\The Hanalei system has 72 Siemens 130-watt photovoltaic panels feeding three inverters.\Except for one failed inverter, which the manufacturer quickly replaced, it has functioned without serious problems, said Charlie Cowden, whose Hanalei Solar designed the system.\Instead of charging batteries, the Hanalei Center facility hooks directly into the power grid. If the shopping center is using more power than the system produces, the center takes power from the grid. If there's more power than needed, the center ships power to the grid.\The savings, after tax credits provided by both the state and federal governments, mean the system should pay for itself in four to five years, Cowden said.\On Maui, the Maui Recycling Service has arranged with Maui Car Rentals to rent out a Volkswagen Beetle that will operate exclusively on biodiesel fuel. The car is equipped with an unmodified diesel engine, and will use fuel made from used cooking oil, which is processed by Pacific Biodiesel. The recycled fuel can be run in a diesel engine without changes. Biodiesel is a growing application for used oils.\Kona Community Hospital on the Big Island is the first of three members of the Hawai`i Health System Corp. to bring online a new co-generation facility, which will reduce the hospital's power costs by $30,000 a month - the savings will go to pay off the $1.8 million cost of the system, and is expected to do so in six to 10 years, said assistant administrator Glenn Sparks.\The key to the savings is that the Kealakekua hospital's new 475-kilowatt diesel generator will not only produce power, but the hot water from the generator's cooling system will be used to preheat hospital hot water and - as strange as it seems - will help run the hospital's chillers as well. That reduces the need to use electricity or gas to run hot water or chilling systems.\Co-generation systems of this sort still use fossil fuels, but their increased efficiency reduces the overall demand for energy.\Jan TenBruggencate is The Advertiser's Kaua`i bureau chief and its science and environment writer.

While polar ice caps melt and sea levels rise as a result of carbon released from fossil fuels, the globe continues to awaken to the importance of renewables. With an impressive El Nino and a veritable parade of hurricanes passing close to the islands this year, one wonders how long we can be lucky.
\
Concerns for the environment, combined with a recent relaxation in rooftop solar approvals by Hawaiian Electric Co. and the possibility that the Public Utilities Commission will pull back on net metering, has driven a renewed frenzy in solar installations in Hawaii. Still, there is a steady chorus claiming that the production of photovoltaic panels has its own dangerous carbon footprint. Does it?
\
It turns out that PV does have a carbon footprint, but, over the typical 20-year life of a solar panel, it delivers a substantial net benefit compared with fossil fuels such as oil, coal and even natural gas. At the same time, there are multiple steps to the process that create opportunities not only to curb global warming, but also to be socially and environmentally responsible ... or not.
\
The guts of a PV panel come from mining quartz, which is then refined to silicon dioxide. Mining, one of the oldest professions in the world, is subject to a robust safety industry in modern countries but can be frightfully lax in developing nations. Silicosis, a lung disease that comes from breathing silicon dust, is more common in such countries. The process that turns silicon into a solar panel also requires the use of multiple chemicals that may or may not be recycled and/or disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner.
\
In fact, before 2008, PV manufacturing occurred primarily in Europe, Japan and the United States. Today the majority of panels come from China, Malaysia, Taiwan and the Philippines. Case in point: While visiting a PV installer in Australia this past summer, the principal explained that until recently most PV panels down under had been sourced from Germany. Although the quality of Chinese panels was left wanting, to remain competitive on price, his firm had to switch over.
\
The good news is, technology is rapidly advancing, and there always seems to be a better solution around the corner. Thin-film solar-cell technology, for example, can be just as efficient as silicon-based solar cells, less costly to manufacture, and requires less material and energy to build.
\
Moving forward, it will be important to use a comprehensive, balanced scorecard and responsibly evaluate social, environmental and financial factors associated with potential sources of energy. As technologies continue to evolve, statisticians and marketing consultants alike will continue to find new ways of putting lipstick on a pig.
\
Take liquefied natural gas, for example. Not long ago I spoke with one of the local consultants who has been retained to assist NextEra in its quest to acquire HECO. He described those opposed to LNG as ""purists."" What? LNG releases greenhouse gases, just like coal and oil. While it is somewhat cleaner and thought by some to be a ""bridge solution,"" LNG should not be peddled as a renewable.
\
The Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition evaluates solar panels using a broad range of metrics, including emissions transparency, chemical reduction plans, workers' rights, health and safety, modular toxicity, recycling and greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Global warming is real, and curbing the trend must be a global priority. Continuing to develop and employ responsible renewables is a critical part of the solution. Let's be wise about it.

58,"
Before launching into this week's column, I'd like to first recognize the revolutionary steps forward we took in the past two weeks: The Hokule'a arrived in New York; the United States is about to have its first female presidential nominee from a major political party; and the world celebrated the life of a legendary athlete who broke down barriers beyond his sport.
\
And one last one, for good measure: Hawaii is on the nation's radar for energy innovation. The Energy Excelerator was featured in a recent White House blog post, and the administration sent the deputy secretary of energy to visit the startup. A terribly good two weeks, in my opinion.
\
Another highlight, for me, was talking story with Hermina Morita. She was the first chairwoman of the Public Utilities Commission and represented Hanalei, Princeville and Kapaa for 15 years in the state House of Representatives. If you've ever had a conversation with her, you know she speaks with a calm passion. She said, ""All the opportunities in my life, I sort of fell into it. They were never planned.""
\
Growing small
\
""When I was growing up there (on Lanai), it was a really special time and under really special circumstances,"" Morita said. ""It was still a plantation town at the time, but Father was one of the few people on Lanai that didn't work for Dole Company. I had four sisters and three brothers. ... Growing up in a small town, you don't want to bring shame to your family, so you always try to do your best. Knowing that family is important shaped by worldview.""
\
Never again
\
""In 1990 I ran for the Kauai County Council not knowing anything about politics. I lost by 300 votes. I told myself at the time that I'm never going to do this again. I hated campaigning,"" she continued.
\
""Then in 1996, for the state House, there was a bunch of us that was unsatisfied with the incumbent. We spent a long time recruiting a candidate to run against the incumbent. And at the last minute he bowed out. The deadline was approaching, and I thought to myself, 'We cannot just let this guy walk in unopposed.' And since no one else would do it, I filed. I won by 75 votes, and that's how I started my career at the Legislature.""
\
Painfully beautiful
\
""The opportunity (to be a PUC commissioner) came up at the end of 2010. I never thought of myself in that role. I didn't think I had the right qualifications; I'm neither an attorney nor an engineer. But knowing how important the PUC was to the process, I jumped into the fire not knowing what I was getting into,"" she said. ""And it was really rewarding. When my reappointment was up and that became somewhat controversial, I was just sad to see politics take over. And that's the frustrating part right now; there is just too much political interference in a time when we need certainty.""
\
Innovative policy
\
""In my first year as committee chair of the Energy and Environment Committee, the only major bill that I felt moved through was adding a cultural aspect into the EIS (environmental impact statement) process,"" she said. ""It was a down economy year, so a lot of environmental programs were being cut back. I wasn't very successful in trying to get or maintain the budget of those kinds of programs, so I felt ineffective. We couldn't fund these programs without a robust economy, and a big part of the economy is vulnerable to energy pricing. When I started researching energy issues, one of the policies that intrigued me was a renewable portfolio standard (RPS). I started looking more into how to set market standards for renewables. And so, the objective was to start a market for renewables, and the featured policy was renewable portfolio standard and net energy metering.""
\
Minor miracle
\
""I remember when we passed the net metering bill and RPS, Maurice Kaya (former administrator of the State Energy Office from 1988 to 2008) walked in my office and let out a 'Yeah!'"" Morita recalled with a laugh.
\
""It was a matter of working hand in hand with the State Energy Office. They would help with technical aspects, how to draft the bills and what were appropriate goals to set forth. I saw it as my job at the Legislature to educate other legislators and move policy forward. It was a matter of changing mindsets. I look back now and, to me, it was still a miracle that we got the net metering and RPS bill to pass.""
\
Incremental strides
\
""I remember I sat next to a journalist -- he was also a political commentator -- on the plane. I was venting to him about how the net metering and RPS bills had gotten watered down and was told in the negotiation process by members of the Legislature to take it or leave,"" she said. ""It was such a watered-down version, but I took it. He gave me a book that he wrote, and he inscribed it to me saying, 'Half a sandwich is better than none.' That taught me a lot about moving in incremental steps and building upon what you have.""

My heart goes out to those who have lost their home due to illness, abuse and loss of a job. The number is growing to a point of lawlessness that cannot be sustained by a law-abiding population.
\
One thing that may work are mobile parks -- not the blight of dilapidated trailers but ones neatly arranged with fruit trees and vegetable gardens.
\
The parks would have to be sustained by the people living there who take out the refuse to a central point, clean common areas, keep up their living quarters and work in the gardens and police the area.
\
Everyone needs a chance to live here but they need to respect the laws and land and do a fair share of work.

Tour helicopters shatter peace
\
We used to enjoy our quiet times sitting on our lanai enjoying the gentle tradewinds and views of the marina.
\
That has all changed. Now we sit on our lanai and agonize over the constant noise of the tour helicopters flying at low altitude overhead as they conduct their tours, flying from Diamond Head to Koko Head and beyond. Instead of flying along the coastline, they have now decided to save fuel by flying directly over the neighborhoods of Hawaii Kai.
\
If it occurred occasionally, it probably would not be a problem, but it occurs every 20 to 30 minutes every day.
\
Someone needs to help us get our quiet neighborhoods back. Make these tour helicopters use the coastline for their flight patterns while making it safer for everyone should there be an unforeseen accident.

\
Utilities profit from PV systems
\
According to a new report released by Environment America, rooftop photovoltaic systems provide more value to the electric grid than their owners are paid for under current net metering policies.
\
The report documents ""value of solar"" studies in 11 states, and in all nine states where the studies were performed by independent entities, the calculated value was greater than the utilities paid their customers for the solar energy they produced.
\
It also shows how utilities have -- falsely -- asserted that customers with rooftop solar systems are not paying their fair share for electric grid operations, and that instead, those customers have been providing benefits to the utilities far beyond their net metering compensation.
\
These ""value of solar"" studies provide solid evidence that utility efforts to curtail net metering have nothing to do with fairness to ratepayers and everything to do with protecting their monopoly over power generation.

Confederate flag meant treason
\
I am amazed at the insensitivity of those who find the Confederate battle flag as an appropriate symbol of southern U.S. heritage.
\
Lynching is part of that heritage, but that is not celebrated like the flag, except by bigots. Obviously, symbols such as flags have a large subjective and selective element in their popularity with people.
\
Perhaps proponents of that flag need to be reminded from time to time of the original intent behind that flag: the establishment of a slave republic on the North America continent by elite white men by means of treason against the United States of America.

U.S. terror study misleading
\
The Star-Advertiser recently reported a study claiming fewer murders were committed in the name of Islam than were committed in the name of all other fanatic groups combined (""Non-Muslim zealots out-kill jihadis,"" Star-Advertiser, June 25).
\
Of course they were. Just like fewer murders are committed by any one of America's many ancestries -- German, Chinese, Irish, Japanese, African, Spanish, Mongolian, etc. -- than by all the rest combined.
\
Plus, 3,000 terroristic murders in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001, were excluded. And 13 murders of innocent civilians at Fort Hood were reclassified as not terroristic. (Yes, unarmed American soldiers are innocent civilians.)
\
And in more than a dozen places worldwide, thousands to hundreds of thousands recently have been murdered, and continue to be. None in the name of Christianity, Hindi, Judaism, Buddhism, or white supremacy. All in the name of Islam.
\
When any belief includes approval of murdering non-believers, the fact that most of those believers are non-violent matters not.

Dems' legacy not a good one

TMT sides need mutual respect
\
Following the ongoing extensive trouble related to the telescopes on Mauna a Wakea has given me deep feelings of sadness and conflicting responses to those participating in the discussions.
\
I grew up in Waipahu, and still consider Hawaii home.
\
I know which side I support intellectually, but I feel that both sides have behaved very, very badly.
\
It is completely unacceptable to cast the views of those with whom you disagree as evil, or culturally ignorant, when you know that sincere attempts have been made to be culturally sensitive.
\
It is also completely unacceptable to use racist language or to cast the views on the other side as scientifically backwards, when the issues at hand are protection of a mountain and not just scientific pursuits.
\
I love Hawaii and would like to see the intransigence stop and this conflict resolved through discussions that have on both sides genuine and mutual respect.
\
Declaring that the other parties must lose in order for you to win is not the path of aloha; it is genuinely the path of folly.

Narrow pay gap to keep teachers
\
It is disheartening to see the Star-Advertiser take the wrong stance on nearly every educational issue (""Hold principals to higher standards,"" Star-Advertiser, Our View, April 24).
\
I am very fortunate to work at a school with a history of strong administrators, past and present. However, it is common knowledge among experienced teachers that school administrators are rarely drawn from the pool of strongest teachers.
\
In Hawaii, this fact is exacerbated by chronically low teacher salaries and comparatively poor work environments, which cause scores of fledgling teachers each year to flee their classrooms in pursuit of the higher salaries and air-conditioned offices that administrative positions afford.
\
The proper stance to take is to support narrowing the gap between teacher and administrative salaries, thus discouraging novice teachers from pursuing an administrative path before they have acquired a sufficient breadth of experience to effectively administer schools.

New law could hurt Kupuna Care
\
While many seniors celebrated the Legislature's $4.2 million appropriation to the state's Kupuna Care program, the damaging language in the enabling legislation may be felt for years to come.
\
That's because Senate Bill 2346 opened the door for Medicaid-eligible residents to potentially access Kupuna Care services, which was not the program's original intent.
\
Since its establishment in 1999, Kupuna Care has been a program of last resort for lower- and middle-income frail elderly to turn for home and community-based services that delay or prevent the need for costly institutional care.
\
Its intent is to help residents avoid impoverishing themselves and winding up in Medicaid.
\
By expanding Kupuna Care to Medicaid-eligible individuals, lawmakers have provided an incentive for more people to access this limited pool of state funds. This could leaving vulnerable another group of older folks -- those with no public services -- who, without services, may themselves become impoverished in the future.

HECO and city worked quickly
\
Hawaiian Electric Co. gave us a net-metering agreement in a week, the city's electrical inspector approved our installation in a week after the electricians completed the work, and HECO installed our net meter about one week after that (""Solar survey blisters HECO,"" Star-Advertiser, April 24).
\
Our installation included a new overhead service drop to the relocated meter box, which HECO did within a few days of being asked by the electricians.
\
I don't see how anybody could have done it faster. I do not believe that HECO dragged its feet.
\
The city responded quickly also, with the electronic permit filing system now in place, and very quick electrical inspection to close the permit.
\
One of the six solar energy vendors I interviewed before selecting a contractor, would not provide an estimate until I signed a contract.
\
I was told, ""You can always back out later.""

They also seemed more intent on leasing a system, not selling one.

Question: The city is constantly encouraging us to conserve energy. In response, more people have been installing photovoltaic systems as part of Hawaiian Electric Co.'s Net Energy Metering program. After a PV system is installed, it has to be approved by a city electrical inspector before the homeowner can take advantage of the NEM program. Unfortunately, an inspector on the Windward side has been very slow in approving PV systems, saying it is a low priority for him. Some installed last year have still not been approved. Why does the city encourage homeowners to install PV systems while an inspector delays approving them?
\
Question: I had solar panels put on my roof back in December. I have been waiting more than four months to get the new net metering panel from HECO, but the city has not completed the electrical inspection, which needs to be done before they can put in the new meter. Who can I call to speed this up? I live in Kailua.
\
Answer: After we brought up your complaints, the city Department of Planning and Permitting said it is looking at ways to speed up the inspection process.
\
The inspection backlog is not because of any inspector deciding they are a low priority, but because of the large number of new photovoltaic systems being installed and not enough inspectors.
\
""We've seen a tremendous increase in the number of residential photovoltaic systems being installed in recent years as a result of streamlining efforts by the department, including online permitting for PV systems,"" said Art Challacombe, DPP's chief of customer service.
\
There's been a nearly fivefold increase in the number of PV permits issued between 2009 and 2011: 631 in fiscal year 2009 compared with 3,102 in fiscal year 2011.
\
But while the number of permits has risen significantly, the number of electrical inspectors has not because of budget constraints, Challacombe said.
\
""We are conducting the inspections as quickly as we can, based on called inspections from the contacter, and servicing consolidated areas for efficiency and not on a 'priority' basis,"" he said. ""Since being brought to our attention by Kokua Line, DPP is examining options for improving our PV inspection turnaround.""
\
One option is amending the electrical code to allow ""contractor certification,"" which would eliminate the need for an inspector to visit a home.
\
""We expect to go to the City Council with a new electrical code later this month,"" Challacombe said. ""The city appreciates the overwhelming response by residents to calls for energy conservation.""
\
Question: I went to a University of Hawaii Wahine softball doubleheader where there was no admission charge. But there were two guys manning a table with a donation box. I made a small donation to support the program. What are the donations used for?
\
Answer: Donations collected by the Na Wahine Softball Booster Club go ""straight to Rainbow Wahine softball,"" said Kara Nishimura, assistant director for the UH sports media relations office.
\
The money is used to buy food for postgame meals and in-between snacks for the team, additional equipment, even professional development for the coaching staff (such as attending the National Fastpitch Coaches Association meeting this year) -- basically, ""anything that their budget does not cover,"" Nishimura said.
\
Outright cash donations this year totaled about $1,500, not including what was collected last weekend. Club dues also support the team.
\
According to the booster club's website, nawahine.com, its mission is ""to provide financial and moral support, attract new fans, and promote a positive environment that will maintain one of the nations (sic) elite softball programs.""

Hawaii egg production totaled 6.10 million, or 16,944 cases, in August, down 10 percent from a year earlier. Total cattle marketings for the month were 4,100 a head, up 3 percent from August 2007. The increase was due to a 7 percent increase in exports, offsetting a 9 percent decrease in the number of head commercially slaughtered.
\
Hawaii commercial beef production during August totaled 611,000 pounds, up fractionally from a year ago. Pork production was 299,000 pounds, up less than 1 percent.

Watumull buys Big Island complex
\
Watumull Properties Corp., a Honolulu-based real estate investment company, said yesterday it has acquired the fee simple Sunset Plaza office/retail complex in Kailua-Kona.
\
The property, located on Kuakini Highway, is completely occupied with tenants including IBM, the U.S. Army, and Child and Family Services.
\
Watumull now owns five properties in Kailua-Kona and is seeking additional commercial real estate investments in Hawaii.

Isle energy policies get low grades
\
Hawaii was given both average and failing grades for its policies allowing homeowners and small business owners who generate renewable energy to connect to the grid and receive credit for the electricity they produce.
\
Hawaii was given a ""C"" grade for net metering, or billing arrangements with customers who produce their own energy, and an ""F"" for interconnection policies, the Network for New Energy Choices said in a report released yesterday. The grades were unchanged from last year.
\
The New York-based environmental group recommended that Hawaii improve its net metering by increasing system capacity to 2 megawatts and boost program capacity to at least 5 percent of a utility's peak demand. For interconnectivity, the report recommended increasing covered system capacity to 20 megawatts and prohibiting requirements for additional insurance.

63,"\\Two years ago, Gov. David Ige signed into law a bill that directs the state’s utilities to generate 100 percent of their electricity sales from renewable energy resources by 2045 - an ambitious mandate for the most petroleum- dependent state in the nation.\Hawaii’s electricity generation is dominated by fossil fuels. And due to the continued costs tied to importing most of the energy used throughout the state, ratepayers shoulder the highest prices nationwide - more than twice the U.S. average.\But with the clean energy law in place, amid stops and starts, a transition to a fuller, homegrown renewable portfolio for the electricity sector, which promises to better the islands’ economy, environment and energy security, is now underway. For example, today nearly 1 in 3 single-family dwellings here produces power from the sun, with about 80,000 solar systems operating.\Meeting the 2045 deadline also means lowering overall electrical consumption by stepping up efficiency efforts.\ENERGY CONSERVATION CODE\Hawaii’s new energy code is based on the 2015 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) - a model code adopted by many states and municipal governments, which sets minimum design and construction requirements for energy efficiency.\Among the recent statewide upgrades:\>> Compared to the current code (in place since 2006), it reduces energy use up to 33 percent.\>> Savings will add up, year after year. By 2045, the cumulative statewide energy savings will be more than $1 billion.\>> Hotel-related amendments address open lanai doors, hotel room efficiencies and AC use in unenclosed spaces.\>> Better walls, roofs and windows allow smaller AC systems.\>> Reflective and/or shaded walls allow single-wall construction, and are allowed in lieu of wall insulation.\>> Optimized “Tropical Zone” home uses 52 percent as much energy as a fully compliant AC-cooled home. This zone allows ceiling fans in lieu of AC, and jalousie windows.\Source: Hawaii Energy Office\Earlier this year, Ige signed an administrative rule for an updated energy conservation code. (After counties sign off on a version of it, the code will guide new construction and a large slice of residential, commercial and state building renovation.) The previous code was based on 2006 state industry standards.\Much has changed since then to push forward green-minded technology.\For example, most lights used 11 years ago were incandescent bulbs. Today LEDs - touted as an energy-efficiency superhero - are the standard, costing a fraction what they did a decade ago and needing a fraction of the energy that incandescents use.\Among significant changes in the code: a new lighting requirement and a “tighter” building envelope (walls, windows and roofs), which more effectively keep the sun’s heat out, said Howard Wiig, an energy analyst in the state Energy Office.\The old code had no residential lighting requirement. Now: 75 percent of the lights must be high efficiency, “effectively barring incandescents,” said Wiig, adding, “This has the secondary effect of reducing the heat load caused by lighting.”\Ramsey Brown, an energy engineer at Hawai‘i Energy, a program that helps reduce electricity use by providing free or low-cost efficient appliances and other products, points to the code’s residential “Tropical Zone” as a step forward.\“This new requirement is a nod back to more simple construction where it incorporates Hawaii’s tropical breezes as a way to effectively cool a home, along with installing large overhangs to shade windows and sliding doors,” Brown said.\For commercial properties, he said, “commissioning (the process of verifying and documenting the meeting of code requirements) will play a larger role moving forward. Buildings have more complexity, such as intelligent lighting and air conditioning controls, which require fine-tuning and accurate adjustments for efficient and comfortable operation.”\It will cost more to build to the new code, but in the case of homes, that spending can be recouped in energy savings in an estimated 4.3 years. Across-the-board statewide savings, according to the state Energy Office, could total more than $1.4 billion in energy costs over the next 20 years.\The Honolulu Star-Advertiser asked Blue Planet Foundation, a clean-energy focused nonprofit, and the state’s dominant electric utility, Hawaiian Electric Co., to weigh in on progress toward the state’s renewable goal.\FOSSIL FUELS AND RENEWABLES\According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s latest figures, less than 1 percent of electricity in the United States was generated using oil in 2015. By contrast, Hawaii relied on fossil fuels - oil and coal, nearly 70 percent and 13 percent, respectively - for most of its electricity generation. Fossil fuels, which emit carbon dioxide when burned, contribute to environmental problems, including global warming.\WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE TOP STRIDES SINCE THE 2015 LAW TOOK EFFECT?\Jeff Mikulina, executive director, Blue Planet Foundation: \First, simply setting the 100 percent renewable goal reshaped the energy agenda in Hawaii. It changed the conversation about what’s possible - not only in Hawaii, but elsewhere around the globe (California, for instance, is currently deliberating an identical 100 percent mandate). By setting the 100 percent vision, energy stakeholders were able to move past unproductive squabbles about where we are headed so that we can work productively on the “how” details. The law has fostered collaboration and aligned our energy planning with climate reality.\Second, with the law on the books, Hawaii has telegraphed that it is open for clean energy business and innovation. We saw the results of this when the utility cooperative on Kauai, KIUC, inked deals for some of the first-ever solar plus storage projects. These are game­changers on our journey to 100 percent renewable, upending traditional beliefs about clean energy (not dependable, too expensive).\What makes these projects remarkable is not only that they will provide solar energy at night, but they will provide solar at night at prices that beat fossil fuel. The first project with Tesla, which came online this year, provides 13 megawatts of power and 52 megawatt- hours of energy at a price of 13.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. The second project with AES (the same company that owns the coal-fired power plant on Oahu), currently under development, is twice as large in size and storage capacity - but at a lower price of 11 cents per kilowatt-hour. … Our cleanest energy future may also be our cheapest.\Scott Seu, senior vice president of public affairs, Hawaiian Electric Co.: \The 2015 RPS (renewable portfolio standards) mandate was that 15 percent of electricity sales had to come from renewables, and we exceeded that and hit 23 percent. The three Hawaiian Electric Companies are now at 26 percent and we’re still moving forward. Hawaii Electric Light is at 54 percent, the highest in the state, and Maui Electric is almost at 40 percent.\I’d say another important success is how we’ve revamped how we talk to our customers and other stakeholders on creating the roadmaps for getting to 100 percent renewables, like the Power Supply Improvement Plan or grid modernization.\The traditional approach for us engineers is that we start by focusing on the operational and technical issues, come up with the plans and solutions, and then we say: “Here you go.” In this day and age people expect a lot more than that; they want more of a say. What we’re trying to do now is to first ask our communities and customers: “What do you want?” and then go from there.\WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE TOP STALL OR DISAPPOINTMENT?\Blue Planet: Shortly after adopting the 100 percent renewable energy law, the state and utility throttled Hawaii’s biggest clean energy success story: rooftop solar. The policy of net energy metering drove the rapid widespread adoption of solar for households and businesses across the state. In 2007, Hawaiian Electric estimated that through net metering, rooftop solar would grow 20-fold by the end of 2015; instead it grew over 350 times as large as it was in 2007.\… That policy catalyzed over $1 billion in private investment in helping reduce the state’s dependence on fossil fuels. But that solar growth came to a screeching halt in October 2015 when Hawaii became the first state to end the net metering policy. The move devastated the local solar industry, which at one time represented one-quarter of all construction jobs in the islands, forcing the layoff of hundreds of employees. While solar may still rebound with new policies and programs, we’ve essentially taken away the most powerful tool expanding renewable energy and democratizing energy choice.\HECO: In the early days of our clean energy movement there was quick progress almost across the board. Anything from adding rooftop solar to wind farms to solar farms to expansion of geothermal and waste to energy. But as we added renewables, we started to experience technical challenges and had to slow things down while we figured those out, because above all, the lights have to stay on. We’re making really good progress and pushing ahead, but I think everyone would like this to move faster.\The other area where I wish we’d make quicker progress is getting clean energy to become a true third leg of our economy alongside tourism and government, where clean technologies and intellectual property are actually created and produced in Hawaii, and we export this know-how so that revenues flow into the state. We can be so much more than just consumers of clean tech developed outside Hawaii. It would be great to marry up our clean energy policies with economic development policies.\WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE UPDATED ENERGY CONSERVATION CODE?\Blue Planet: While we are supportive of this critical update … Blue Planet Foundation recognizes that the new building standards don’t go far enough - they leave a lot of money (and energy waste) on the table, and they aren’t anticipating the coming evolution of how buildings interact with the energy grid.\Buildings built today will be with us in 2045 and beyond. We should strive for zero net energy buildings - or even energy positive buildings that produce more energy than they consume. New buildings today should enable the building to interact with the modern energy grid, including “demand response” control technologies (that turn off noncritical loads for a short period to help balance the energy grid) and technologies that are responsive to dynamic energy pricing.\Also, buildings should have grid-interactive electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, or at least be “EV ready,” to smooth the deployment of our renewable transportation future.\HECO: This (updated code) is a good thing, in that it reminds us all of the critical importance of energy efficiency. The cheapest kilowatt-hour of electricity is the one that you don’t use, and I really believe that too much of our attention gets focused on how we produce more renewable energy.\The mantra has always been to invest in energy efficiency first - lighting, smart thermostats, solar hot water - since you get more bang for your buck, and then you work on renewable energy generation. Without energy efficiency, our 100 percent renewable energy target will be much higher, and getting there will be much more expensive.\Get the latest news by email Sign Up\Credit: By Maureen O’Connell"
64," Honolulu ranked first among the nation’s 50 largest cities for photovoltaic solar installed per capita, and placed third in total existing solar PV capacity installed to date, according to a survey released Wednesday by the nonprofit organizations Environment America Research & Policy Center and Frontier Group. \ Since the annual survey started in 2013, Honolulu has held first place for PV installed per resident, which amounted to 840.88 watts in 2019, followed by San Diego with 294.8 watts per capita. \ The report, “Shining Cities 2020,” states that more solar capacity was added to the U.S. grid in 2019 than any other energy source, but also warns against loss of momentum in arresting climate change, through such goals as Hawaii’s pledge to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2045, due to the economic crash caused by the coronavirus pandemic. \ “The United States now has more than 77 gigawatts (GW) of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity installed — enough to power more than one in every 10 homes in America,” the report said, compared with approximately 11 GW installed in 2013. \ Honolulu’s total solar PV installed in 2019 was 292.12 megawatts, behind San Diego, which placed second with 420.38 megawatts and top-ranked Los Angeles with 483.8 megawatts. Last year, Honolulu climbed back to third place, a position it attained in 2016 and 2017, after having ranked fourth in 2018 and 2019. \ “Cities are leading the charge to install clean, renewable solar energy,” said Wendy Wendlandt, acting president of Environment America, in a statement. “Each year of our study we’ve found that more local leaders are pursuing solar projects and smart local policies.” \ In 2013, the first year of the study, eight of the cities surveyed had enough solar PV per capita to qualify as “Solar Stars” (cities with 50 or more watts of solar PV capacity installed per capita). In 2019, that number jumped to 26 cities. \ The authors called for continued commitment to solar energy growth. Their recommendations included net energy metering, in which owners of rooftop solar systems earn credits for excess energy they deliver to the grid. \ Net metering ended in Hawaii in 2015, after which Oahu solar permits dropped by between 33% and 50%, according to the Hawaii Solar Energy Association. \ “Now is the time to build the future we need, which means supporting the clean energy sector through the pandemic and incentivising the broad deployment of clean energy technologies like solar at the federal level so we can advance a future powered entirely by renewable energy sources,” said Johanna Neumann, senior director of Environment America’s campaign for 100% renewable energy. \ The report can be viewed at environmentamerica.org/feature/ame/shining- cities-2020. \ Community members also can share their ideas and priorities for green energy and curbing fossil fuel emissions that spur climate change by filling out a survey by Honolulu’s Office of Climate Change, Sustainability and Resiliency, which is seeking public input by May 31 for its first Climate Action Plan.

Leslie Cole-Brooks: Executive director, Hawaii Solar Energy Association.
\
Leslie Cole-Brooks is executive director of the Hawaii Solar Energy Association, whose 83 business members seem to face unending economic challenges, including likely expiration in 2016 of the 30 percent federal solar investment tax credit for customers, problems with interconnecting to Hawaiian Electric Co.'s energy-distribution grid, and, most recently, the proposed purchase of HECO parent Hawaiian Electric Industries by Florida-based NextEra Energy Co.
\
Cole-Brooks joined the nonprofit trade association in May 2012, and said it has matched well with her vision of years ago to work on issues close to her heart.
\
A graduate of Analy High School in Sebastopol, Calif., she said it was shortly after working with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District in the mid-'90s that she realized ""it was the environment and environmental concerns that really mattered to me."" That's also why, after already earning degrees in geology (University of California, Davis, 1982) and both a graduate certificate in energy management and design (1994) and a master's degree in English from Sonoma State University (1997), she decided to also pursue a law degree.
\
""I was working for an advocacy group that worked on clean water in Northern California,"" she said, ""and I saw that law was where the rubber really met the road. They got stuff done. So I just took the leap.""
\
She learned that the University of Hawaii's law school had one of the nation's best environmental law programs, ""and for me as a swimmer, it was just such an easy decision.""
\
Earning her law degree in 2010, Cole-Brooks went on to work for state Rep. Cynthia Thielen, whom she admired for her work on environmental issues, then worked with her husband Andy in their general contracting business while frequently testifying as an individual at the Legislature on bills that she cared about, some of which related to solar energy.
\
That's how she came to meet HSEA co-founder Cully Judd III, which led to her joining the association, which was founded in 1977 and whose members include ""contractors, installers, distributors, manufacturers, utility and other businesses that are involved with the solar industry.""
\
Cole-Brooks is still active as a swimmer at the Oahu Club in Hawaii, and lives with her husband in Kuliouou Makai.
\
Question: What is the purpose of the Hawaii Solar Energy Association?
\
Answer: Our purpose is to promote the adoption of solar energy for a sustainable economy and a clean energy future. We advocate for all renewables, but our focus is on solar hot water and photovoltaic, commercial and residential, so it's more rooftop, even though some of our members do larger projects as well.
\
Q: How are the members of the association doing right now? Are they mostly healthy?
\
A: It's been a tough couple of years. We had changes with the way the tax credit was administered at the end of 2012, and then there's been ...
\
Q: What happened to the tax credit?
\
A: It's kind of a long story, but there was a change in the way the cap was calculated. ... And it closed a loophole, which I think in the long run it's probably a good thing, but it was more the uncertainty that it caused customers and businesses. ... It's like anything, that a business needs stability, and not the sense that something is going to change that could really impact you in the long run. ...
\
But the real issue has been interconnection, and that's what we have been struggling with these last couple of years. The utility (Hawaiian Electric Co.) has said, ""Wait a minute. We have concerns and issues with the degree of penetration of intermittent resources,"" and things slowed down significantly in 2013, and we're still recovering.
\
Q: Is that about how HECO was delaying approval of interconnections to the grid?
\
A: Yes. It is all part of that. Before this change in the way net energy metering (NEM) was administered, on Oahu you could go and get your installations, get your permits and do all that and then you file your NEM application at the end; you knew that you would get in. But now you need to file the NEM application first and get approval before you install an energizing system, depending on where you are.
\
Q: About the tax credits, what do you think about the idea that ... the solar industry has been getting an unfair government advantage and it's time to start ending those government breaks?
\
A: When I hear that we don't need the tax incentive any more, I think, OK, the purpose of a tax incentive is it's a signal from government that says we want to see this happen. And, in fact, we want to see this happen so badly that we're willing to invest in it and create an incentive for customers to invest their own money on that because it's good for everybody, right?
\
So, OK, I see we've got 12 percent of rooftops (in Hawaii) have some form of photovoltaic, but we have 88 percent that do not. So I don't see that as ""mission accomplished."" I don't see that as being ""we're done now."" So when I hear anyone saying ""we need to get rid of the incentive,"" I ask, ""Oh, I guess we're finished, huh? We're good to go? We're 100 percent renewable, and we've done it all?""
\
Q: You wrote a commentary for the Star-Advertiser in September titled ""Is Hawaiian Electric trying to kill rooftop solar?"" Your conclusion then was what, and what would it be now?
\
A: Well, at that point it seemed the change in the way net energy metering was administered, it was so abrupt and sudden that it caused complete chaos for some time, where companies and customers were trying to adjust and figure out what was what, and also that it really depended on where you were, what your circuit status was ... Now we're working our way through it, and I think that through the DER (distributed energy resources) docket (before the state Public Utilities Commission) that we're making progress; it's just been quite a journey and people have certainly lost their jobs, companies have gone out of business. ... It's hard to say, though, what's coming up ... considering all the things going on with the solar industry.
\
We've got the potential change of control of the utility, and we also have the fact that the ITC, the federal investment tax credit, is about to expire for residential systems at the end of 2016. That's a 30 percent tax credit, money that stays here in the state, money that would have been sent off to the federal government on your taxes. That's 30 percent of the basis of the system which will be pau at the end of 2016, unless there's some kind of change. So how will that affect the industry? How will the PUC respond to the DER docket?
\
Q: What's the DER docket all about?
\
A: ""Distributed energy resources"" is another way to say distributed generation. So it's all about rooftop solar, essentially.
\
Q: Regarding the challenges the industry is facing -- lower prices for fossil fuels would be one of them, too, right?
\
A: Well, yes and no. As a geologist, I know that the cost of fossil fuels is only going to go up. And maybe we have this interim period because of what's been happening with geopolitics, but the cost of fossil fuels is going to go up. And Hawaii will always be the most isolated island on the planet, and we will probably always have the highest rates in the nation so long as we are beholden to imported fossil fuels. So to stall our progress right now, getting to 100 percent renewables, because fossil fuel prices are lower, would be a huge mistake.
\
I don't really see that as an issue. I see more the interconnection process and the utility business model and how does the utility adjust to the fact that people can generate their own electricity, and how do we now interact with the utility in a way that is a true collaboration to use all these distributed resources in a way that's a benefit for everybody?
\
Q: How decentralized can we really go?
\
A: That's a great question. Rather, I should say that is the question. The old business model where the utility generates and you buy, and then they send you a bill and you send them a check, that's just gone. And that was great. It was a great party, but now it's done. So now what do we do?
\
This is what's been happening, and, again, it's in the distributed energy resource docket, in phase two, which will be entered soon, where the Public Utilities Commission, along with the utility and all the intervenors, are going to look at the metrics that matter: How much does it cost to keep the grid alive and well, and how much should each individual customer pay in order to be keep this system going?
\
Q: There's this sense that people with net metering are not really paying their fair share for the grid. Is that right?
\
A: We keep hearing that, and our response is, ""Let's please do the analysis to find out what is the right rate.""
\
And the other question is, in terms of distributed resources, ""What is the value of these resources as it pertains to what they give to the grid?"" We only hear about what they call the cost shift ... and it's always said in this way that's final and determined and everyone agrees. But it should be not ""cost shift,"" but rather ""cost shift?"" -- with a question mark at the end. What is it, how is it calculated and what about all of the benefits that distributed generation does and can provide to the grid? That's really an answer to your question about how decentralized can we go. So it's really exciting. That's where we're going and it's new territory.
\
Q: Does it require a big technological advance -- batteries or something?
\
A: Yes, it does. If we're going to get to a 100 percent RPS (renewable portfolio standards) by 2045 or sooner, we absolutely have to have storage. ... Most of the time (in Hawaii) we have this incredible ... cornucopia of resources, right? We have the sun, wind, geothermal, biomass, waves, and we'll have OTEC someday. It's amazing. But unfortunately the generation doesn't always match the load. So what do you do ... if you don't need all that power? We need to store it. ... We need a way to capture that wealth and use it later.
\
Q: What do you think of the proposed NextEra buyout of HEI?
\
A: We're very concerned. When I first filed my motion to intervene, ... I was neutral. ... I wanted to give it a chance. But in ... my direct testimony on behalf of HSEA, I came out against this new control and stated it is not in the public interest.
\
Our concern is really Florida Power and Light's record in Florida -- Florida, the sunshine state, right? Here in Hawaii, we have 12-13 percent of solar on residential roof space, and in Florida, it's something like 0.5 percent of residential customers. ... And they have this huge AC load. So there's this real mismatch. ... But that's the take of what's been happening in Florida, and what's been happening with their efficiency standards, which were severely downgraded. Then there're concerns about PPAs (power purchasing agreements) and the fact that they can't do third-party transactions. Will they behave the same way when they come to Hawaii?
\
Q: Could it be any worse than the way it is right now?
\
A: Yes, absolutely. You know, working with HECO we've had our struggles, but again I think it goes back to the business model, that they're trying to apply an old model to the new reality and utilities aren't known for being these innovative, nimble startups, you know?
\
Q: Speaking of where we want to go, do you really think the 2045 goal to be 100 percent RPS is achievable?
\
A: Yes. We have to do it.
\
Q: You don't think there's a place at all for fossil fuels -- God's gift from the ground?
\
A: (Laughter) Oh yes, there is a place for fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are what fueled the Industrial Revolution, right?
\
Q: Right, and in the Third World, especially, they still need that stuff pretty bad.
\
A: Well, in the 100 percent RPS bill, there are caveats, that it's not what we're going to do no matter what happens. What it is, is it sets the goal and it sets the intention of where we want to go. And I a hundred percent believe that we need to set the goal and the intention, and ... yes, I can see us getting there. I think Hawaii can do it.
\
First of all, we have the resources, which I talked about before. We have the perfect climate. We have the financial driver because of our high electric rates, which aren't going to go down; we have the continued vulnerability of relying on fossil fuels that are coming from elsewhere; and I just think Hawaii has the heart. I think that people care about the environment here, and they see that as a goal that we can embrace. ... Now the hard work begins.

"
67,"\\For the first time in more than a decade, the Public Utilities Commission has accepted an updated Hawaiian Electric Co. plan detailing how it will reach the state’s goal of 100 percent renewable energy. Following years of utility foot-dragging and PUC scoldings - such as assertions that HECO’s vision was more focused on profits rather than customers - the ambitious new draft comes as a welcome relief.\What’s more, the Power Supply Improvement Plan (PSIP) update intends to significantly increase our renewable energy use in the near term, which will put the state on pace to meet its goal five years early. Here’s hoping that this time around (HECO’s third shot in recent years at proposing an acceptable update), the plan’s vision locks in place a new paradigm that will touch off much-needed changes for our economy, environment and energy security.\Two years ago, Gov. David Ige signed into law a bill that directs the state’s utilities to generate 100 percent of their electricity sales from renewable energy resources by 2045. Hawaii’s electricity generation is now dominated by fossil fuels, which emit carbon dioxide when burned and contribute to environmental problems such as global warming. And due to the continued costs tied to importing most of the energy used throughout the state, ratepayers shoulder the highest prices nationwide - more than twice the U.S. average.\With the clean energy law in place - a lofty mandate for the most petroleum-dependent state in the nation - Hawaii must continue its transition to a fuller, homegrown renewable portfolio for the electricity sector. We’ll get there by increasing renewable power generation and lowering electrical consumption until the lines meet.\A key to the PSIP near-term objective calls for acquiring nearly 400 megawatts of new renewable energy resources by 2021 - collectively, the largest new generation procurement ever undertaken in the state. (The acquisition would equal about one-third of the capacity of the three generating plants that HECO operates on Oahu.)\The PUC, which oversees and regulates public utilities for reliable service and reasonable rates, applauds the goal. But it also rightly urges the state’s dominant electric utility to move quickly on a “transparent, timely and successful procurement process” and capture federal investment tax credits before they expire.\Jeff Mikulina, executive director of Blue Planet Foundation, a clean energy-focused nonprofit said: “It is literally hundreds of millions of potential savings for customers, if these projects get procured and built quickly.” However, that’s also the sticking point as the utility lacks an effective, speedy procurement track record. HECO must endeavor to make the most of emerging developer interest in meeting Hawaii’s needs.\Other near-term targets include resolving ongoing rooftop solar issues, further improving grid reliability to accommodate renewable energy, and development of a community solar program. Such a program is worthwhile in that it could serve as a sort of ratepayer equalizer in that it enables everyone - renters and high-rise dwellers, included - to reap renewable energy benefits.\To reach the 100 percent mark, utilities statewide will likely expand solar, wind and biofuel projects. HECO expects private solar systems to more than double by 2030 to 165,000 from the 79,000 now in use across its territories. Such an aim would help the state rebound from costly losses linked to Hawaii’s move in October 2015 to end its net metering policy.\With the PUC signing off on the latest PSIP strategy, there’s no turning back. After 2022, coal won’t be burned to generate electricity on Oahu. While that fossil fuel may be now be the most reliable and cheapest source of power, encouraging advances in technology are making renewables more competitive. The utility cooperative on Kauai, KIUC, for example, is pursuing solar plus storage projects that will provide solar at night at prices that can beat fossil fuels. Its first project with Tesla provides 13 megawatts of power and 52 megawatt-hours of energy at a price of 13.9 cents per kilowatt-hour.\If HECO can make good on its PSIP, its three sister utilities - Hawaiian Electric Co. on Oahu, Maui Electric Co. and Hawaii Electric Light Co. on Hawaii island - will exceed the state’s renewable-energy milestones, reaching 48 percent by the end of 2020; 72 percent, by the end of 2030; and hitting 100 percent by the end of 2040.\Over the past several years, the utility has stepped up transparency and collaboration efforts. The conversation has shifted. Today electricity utilities, ratepayers and other stakeholders agree that achieving 100 percent renewable energy for Hawaii is possible and beneficial.\Get the latest news by email Sign Up"

So far, the state's Green Energy Market Securitization (GEMS) program, is a $150 million bust.
\
Plagued by a long application process and the end of net energy metering, GEMS -- the financing program designed to help low-income residents take advantage of renewable energy technology -- has been woefully ineffective.
\
When the program launched in 2013, the goal was to fully deploy the $150 million by November 2016, but so far, less than 1 percent has been loaned to consumers.
\
Meanwhile, thanks to a monthly surcharge on energy bills, ratepayers will have paid about $21.5 million as of June 30 for GEMS; an additional $6.4 million will be paid from July through year's end.
\
The intent of GEMS was worthy: Provide low-interest loans to qualifying consumers and nonprofits for rooftop solar systems.
\
The program was set up using proceeds from selling $150 million in state bonds to investors.
\
But market conditions have drastically changed and GEMS, much like other government programs, has been slow to adapt.
\
GEMS had to compete with private solar companies offering customers leasing options, and offered a tedious application process.
\
And the outlook for GEMS became even more grim when the state Public Utilities Commission (PUC) in October ended a popular solar-crediting program that offered owners of solar-energy systems a credit equal to the retail rate for the excess energy that their systems sent to the grid.
\
""The biggest roadblocks have been changes in the macroeconomic and policy environment -- most notably the end of net metering -- that affect the attractiveness of existing GEMS programs,"" said Tara Young, who was brought in eight months ago to restructure GEMS as executive director for the Hawaii Green Infrastructure Authority (HGIA).
\
It might be too little, too late. To date, GEMS has funded only 11 installations with 43 applications pending, representing a paltry $370,000 used of the $150 million.
\
The program's serious deficiencies came to light when Gov. David Ige proposed to tap $100 million from GEMS for an aggressive push to cool 1,000 public school classrooms by year's end.
\
Though the PUC confirmed that would have been a permissible use of GEMS financing, it was a dubious mismatch of program intent. Lawmakers ultimately appropriated $100 million in general funds to cool the schools.
\
HGIA is now making a renewed push for GEMS: The coming weeks will see an open solicitation process for proposals for GEMS financing, for projects such as large-scale solar farms and community solar for apartment dwellers or renters. It will even entertain proposals from other government agencies to finance renewable technolo- gies, which could prove valuable if they reduce government's energy consumption.
\
Still, GEMS' lack of progress is frustrating. State Rep. Chris Lee, the House Energy and Environmental Protection chairman, is right in saying the program must quickly refocus on financing photovoltaic with battery storage so that low- to middle-income residents are able to take advantage of new technology.
\
Young said GEMS is already moving in that direction -- and we hope it will come with an easy-to-use process for consumers.
\
It is too early to give up on the program, Lee said, noting no discussions during the 2016 session focused on pulling the plug on GEMS. The bonds and interest would still need to be paid, regardless.
\
As it is, ratepayers continue to repay bond holders through a ""green infrastructure fee"" tacked onto utility bills: about $1.29 a month for residential customers, which has already totaled about $21.5 million as of June 30.
\
The reinvention of GEMS needs to come sooner rather than later. It is unac-ceptable for $150 million to be sitting idle when it could and should be used to finance worthwhile green energy projects.
"

The state's $150 million financing program designed to help low-income residents own renewable energy failed to live up to its hype, due to a long application process and a discontinued solar incentive. Despite its lackluster rollout, Hawaii residents are still on the hook to pay back the bonds.
\
The program called Green Energy Market Securitization, or GEMS, has been in the works since 2013 and was touted as a potential national model. The Hawaii Green Infrastructure Authority, a state agency created to run GEMS, established programs in 2015 in which consumers and nonprofits could apply for financing of rooftop solar systems.
\
GEMS -- which aimed to help homeowners, renters and nonprofits who cannot afford the upfront costs or cannot qualify for other financing own renewable energy -- was set up using proceeds from selling $150 million in state bonds to investors.
\
For homeowners participating in GEMS, 100 percent of upfront financing is available for solar systems.
\
To date, GEMS has funded 11 installations; 43 applications are in the pipeline, representing about $370,000 of the $150 million available for lending. The authority overseeing GEMS discontinued the program for nonprofits.
\
Originally, the program was projected to have fully deployed the $150 million by November 2016 -- two years after the bonds were sold. Six months away from the goal, more than 99 percent of the funds sit untapped.
\
""There is still so much potential this program has that has been left unfulfilled,"" said State Rep. Chris Lee (D-Kailua, Waimanalo). ""We can help so many families by covering their upfront costs.""
\
While the program isn't living up to its potential, Hawaii ratepayers are left supporting the bonds.
\
At the time of GEMS' launch, the typical residential customer using 600 kilowatt-hours a month paid a ""green infrastructure fee"" of $1.29 a month to repay the bond holders.
\
Ratepayers will have paid about $21.5 million as of June 30 for GEMS, according to a filing submitted to the Public Utilities Commission on May 24. Going forward from July to the end of 2016, ratepayers will pay an additional $6.4 million.
\
""GEMS is a complex program that is among the first of its kind in the nation,"" said Tara Young, executive director for the Hawaii Green Infrastructure Authority. ""It is not unreasonable to expect that the implementation of the program would encounter some early obstacles.""
\
Young said the state ending a solar incentive program made the November 2016 goal unattainable.
\
""The biggest roadblocks have been changes in the macroeconomic and policy environment -- most notably the end of net metering -- that affect the attractiveness of existing GEMS programs,"" Young said. In October, the PUC ended a popular solar crediting program that offered owners of solar-energy systems a credit equal to the retail rate for the excess energy that their systems sent into the grid.
\
The PUC replaced net energy metering with two programs. One replacement, grid-supply, credits new solar owners 15 cents a kilowatt-hour for the extra energy their solar-energy systems send into the grid, roughly 8 cents less than the retail rate that had been offered through net energy metering. The second replacement, called self-supply, encourages customers to buy battery systems because this program does not allow owners of solar-energy systems to send any excess energy into the electric grid.
\
In the period prior to the end of net energy metering, the GEMS programs had 101 new loan applications. GEMS has received only 70 since the program was halted.
\
When asked about the impact the PUC ending net energy metering had on the GEMS program, PUC Chairman Randy Iwase said that HGIA needs to find different ways to use the money. ""Battery storage is a way we have to go,"" Iwase said.
\
Young said HGIA supports improving access to energy storage technology for homeowners. She said the agency is broadening what renewable technologies the GEMS program can help finance, as GEMS' existing program only focuses on solar.
\
""HGIA is now working hard to adapt programs to current and future market conditions, improve our responsiveness to what continues to be a dynamic and cutting-edge market, and improve processes to streamline the consumer experience,"" Young said.
\
GEMS could be used for energy storage, utility grid modernization, utility renewable integration, commercial energy efficiency, technologies that incorporate a water-energy nexus, sewage and wastewater treatment, heating, ventilating, and air conditioning and LED systems, according to HGIA.
\
Another problem with the process was the difficult application residents and nonprofits faced. ""There have also been process issues that have made the application process less simple and efficient than we would like,"" Young said.
\
When the consumer loan program began in summer 2015, applicants were required to mail in or fax applications to HGIA's underwriting partner, Energy Finance Solutions. Feedback from the installers was that the process was cumbersome, Young said.
\
Young said HGIA is working to make the process easier.
\
In March HGIA launched a customer portal with an online application. Next month automated decision-making will be added to the online application process, which will give a potential borrower immediate notice of preapproval, denial or pending status following completion and submission of the online application.
\
Jeff Mikulina, executive director of Blue Planet Foundation and an HGIA board member, said problems came from the program having to compete with private solar companies that offer leasing options to customers.
\
""The competition in terms of the private-sector offerings was pretty good,"" he said. ""There were challenges in making a really smooth program for both contractors and the public to participate in.""
\
Despite GEMS' current numbers, Mikulina said he is confident in the program. ""This funding can be used for anything that advances our clean-energy agenda,"" he said. ""Of course execution is another thing. We have been really frustrated with poor execution across the board of clean-energy ideas. I don't want to put this (GEMS) in that category yet. ""
\
While GEMS has yet to live up to its full $150 million potential, the program has helped some residents.
\
Mililani resident Douglas Maginot said he was referred to GEMS through his solar contractor, Island Pacific Energy, after deciding he didn't want to take a second mortgage out on on his house or apply for a line of credit to finance his 40-panel system.
\
""It's an uncollateralized loan, which is really awesome,"" Maginot said. ""If you had to apply for a second mortgage on your home, that is a hassle. Do I really want to have two lien holders on my house? That is the consideration versus someone who is willing to finance your solar system without taking your firstborn.""
\
Sheldon Dudoit of Mauisaid that after qualifying for the GEMS program he finished the installation of his roughly 40-panel system at the beginning of this year.
\
""This has tremendously helped us with our electric bill,"" Dudoit said. ""We use our AC when it is hot and (our electric bill) could reach up to $400 a month. Now we're looking at paying something about $20 or so.""
\
Dudoit still has to pay back the GEMS loan, but the loan is roughly 25 percent of what his electric bill was. ""Even our monthly payment for the GEMS program is way cheaper than the electric bill,"" he said.

I think the state has a long way to go,"" said Keith Cronin, of Island Energy Solutions, whose own home is loaded with alternative energy technology.\Even in the oil-producing state of Texas, critics say, the electric utility Austin Energy pays customers a rebate of $5 per watt for energy generated by solar power. The utility estimates that covers 50 percent to 80 percent of the cost of installing a solar photovoltaic system.\But in Hawai`i, a residential photovoltaic system gets a $1,750 tax rebate-perhaps 5 percent of the cost of the system. It's not nearly enough, said Marco Mangelsdorf, president of ProVision Technologies, a Hilo-based solar power firm.\""The residential market is kind of the holy grail for alternative energy,"" said Mangelsdorf, who recommends the maximum residential rebate for solar, wind, hydroelectric or other alternative energy systems be upped to $8,000. He also suggests the state should support having utilities give other alternative energy rebates like the ones given for solar hot water systems.\He and other critics say Hawai`i has a long way to go.\Said Rick Reed, president of the Hawai`i Solar Energy Association, ""Look, if you put in a 4-kilowatt solar system and a solar hot water system, it's going to cost $30,000 to $40,000, but you're done (with paying power bills).

He said he has cut his home power bill to about $34 a month by using solar water heating, gas cooking, no air conditioner and drying his wash on a clothesline.\But ""the problem with using the tax code to incentivize people to do it is that you don't have the same level of accountability,"" he said.

Then you have a better idea of the kinds of systems going in, and more accountability over the costs to government.""\Hawai`i leads the nation in one area: per-capita installation of residential solar water heating systems. A state tax credit and utility rebates can cut a solar hot water system's cost of roughly $5,000 by half.\But if a resident wants to put up a solar photovoltaic system capable of producing all of an average home's power, which can cost $30,000 to $40,000, the maximum state tax credit is $1,750 - the same as for a water heating system.\By contrast, if a business wants to install photovoltaics or other alternative energy systems, it can get credits of 35 percent of the cost, up to a maximum of $250,000.\Kaua`i resident Moksha McClure found a unique way to take advantage of that in developing her pet-sitting business, Whiskers Resort.\McClure said her leased agricultural site at Kipu is far from the nearest utility pole.\""For me, it would have been really expensive to bring in electricity. I estimated $40,000 cost,"" she said.\She wanted to install a solar photovoltaic system, with a backup power generator that would burn biodiesel-fuel made from recycled vegetable oil. Total system cost, roughly $30,000, and total potential tax credit, $10,500. It would provide all her business's power requirements.\But McClure said she did not expect her business to produce enough profit in its first years to take advantage of the tax credit. So she arranged for Bank of Hawaii to buy the system and lease it to her. This way, the bank could take the tax credit and would reduce her lease payments accordingly.\""My lease rent is something like negative 18 percent,"" she said.\Activities to promote renewable energy in many states is high, said Lewis Milford of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a states' group promoting renewable energy.\When Peter Jones, a resident of South Burlington, Vt., put a $21,000 solar photovoltaic system on his roof, the state government paid a third of the cost. He no longer has electric bills. Vermont pays up to $12,500 toward solar photovoltaic or windpower systems and $7,500 toward solar hot water systems.\New Jersey's Clean Energy program pays up to $5.50 a watt as a rebate for qualified solar power systems. The New York Incentives for Renewable Energy program pays up to $4.50 a watt. Florida Power and Light's Green Pricing Program in 2002 initiated a system paying $2 to $4 a watt.\California offers a range of rebates for systems, depending on size and the technology used. Small photovoltaic systems qualify for $3.20 a watt. Small hot water systems get $3.60 a watt. Small wind energy systems can get $2.10 a watt.\Hawai`i's strong solar water heater program has been used in about 75,000 residential units statewide. But the less aggressive solar electric program has produced only about 50 legal net-metered systems across the state, said Reed, the Hawai`i Solar Energy Association president.\Gov. Linda Lingle has been supportive of alternative energy systems and has strongly backed the state's renewable energy portfolio standards, which require the utilities to produce 20 percent of all their power from non-fossil fuel sources by the year 2020. The state energy office estimated the state was at 8.2 percent renewable in 2003.\But that doesn't necessarily mean the state will dramatically expand the generation of renewable energy to reach that goal. It could also use conservation to get there.\""Hawai`i also defines renewable energy as electrical energy savings brought about by the use of solar and heat-pump water heating, seawater air conditioning, district cooling systems, solar air conditioning and ice storage, quantifiable energy conservation measures, use of rejected heat from small-scale cogeneration, and customer-sited combined heat and power systems,"" the state energy office said in a report to the federal Department of Energy.\Lingle said that both generation and reduced demand meet the goal. ""It makes common sense to me that we do everything to reduce reliance on energy that's imported,"" Lingle said. ""To sit here and stay as we are is not an option.""\Many in the industry are frustrated particularly by the state's failure to support increases in solar photovoltaics.\""We would like to see the power of photovoltaics fulfilled,"" Reed said. He said that if the state fairly priced the costs of oil, including air pollution and the cost of carbon-dioxide emissions promoting global climate change, it would find solar cells to be a good investment.\USA Today contributed to this report.

72,"
Before launching into this week's column, I'd like to first recognize the revolutionary steps forward we took in the past two weeks: The Hokule'a arrived in New York; the United States is about to have its first female presidential nominee from a major political party; and the world celebrated the life of a legendary athlete who broke down barriers beyond his sport.
\
And one last one, for good measure: Hawaii is on the nation's radar for energy innovation. The Energy Excelerator was featured in a recent White House blog post, and the administration sent the deputy secretary of energy to visit the startup. A terribly good two weeks, in my opinion.
\
Another highlight, for me, was talking story with Hermina Morita. She was the first chairwoman of the Public Utilities Commission and represented Hanalei, Princeville and Kapaa for 15 years in the state House of Representatives. If you've ever had a conversation with her, you know she speaks with a calm passion. She said, ""All the opportunities in my life, I sort of fell into it. They were never planned.""
\
Growing small
\
""When I was growing up there (on Lanai), it was a really special time and under really special circumstances,"" Morita said. ""It was still a plantation town at the time, but Father was one of the few people on Lanai that didn't work for Dole Company. I had four sisters and three brothers. ... Growing up in a small town, you don't want to bring shame to your family, so you always try to do your best. Knowing that family is important shaped by worldview.""
\
Never again
\
""In 1990 I ran for the Kauai County Council not knowing anything about politics. I lost by 300 votes. I told myself at the time that I'm never going to do this again. I hated campaigning,"" she continued.
\
""Then in 1996, for the state House, there was a bunch of us that was unsatisfied with the incumbent. We spent a long time recruiting a candidate to run against the incumbent. And at the last minute he bowed out. The deadline was approaching, and I thought to myself, 'We cannot just let this guy walk in unopposed.' And since no one else would do it, I filed. I won by 75 votes, and that's how I started my career at the Legislature.""
\
Painfully beautiful
\
""The opportunity (to be a PUC commissioner) came up at the end of 2010. I never thought of myself in that role. I didn't think I had the right qualifications; I'm neither an attorney nor an engineer. But knowing how important the PUC was to the process, I jumped into the fire not knowing what I was getting into,"" she said. ""And it was really rewarding. When my reappointment was up and that became somewhat controversial, I was just sad to see politics take over. And that's the frustrating part right now; there is just too much political interference in a time when we need certainty.""
\
Innovative policy
\
""In my first year as committee chair of the Energy and Environment Committee, the only major bill that I felt moved through was adding a cultural aspect into the EIS (environmental impact statement) process,"" she said. ""It was a down economy year, so a lot of environmental programs were being cut back. I wasn't very successful in trying to get or maintain the budget of those kinds of programs, so I felt ineffective. We couldn't fund these programs without a robust economy, and a big part of the economy is vulnerable to energy pricing. When I started researching energy issues, one of the policies that intrigued me was a renewable portfolio standard (RPS). I started looking more into how to set market standards for renewables. And so, the objective was to start a market for renewables, and the featured policy was renewable portfolio standard and net energy metering.""
\
Minor miracle
\
""I remember when we passed the net metering bill and RPS, Maurice Kaya (former administrator of the State Energy Office from 1988 to 2008) walked in my office and let out a 'Yeah!'"" Morita recalled with a laugh.
\
""It was a matter of working hand in hand with the State Energy Office. They would help with technical aspects, how to draft the bills and what were appropriate goals to set forth. I saw it as my job at the Legislature to educate other legislators and move policy forward. It was a matter of changing mindsets. I look back now and, to me, it was still a miracle that we got the net metering and RPS bill to pass.""
\
Incremental strides
\
""I remember I sat next to a journalist -- he was also a political commentator -- on the plane. I was venting to him about how the net metering and RPS bills had gotten watered down and was told in the negotiation process by members of the Legislature to take it or leave,"" she said. ""It was such a watered-down version, but I took it. He gave me a book that he wrote, and he inscribed it to me saying, 'Half a sandwich is better than none.' That taught me a lot about moving in incremental steps and building upon what you have.""

73,"
First a warning: This column is going to use words I haven't written, read or used in decades: ""numerator and denominator.""
\
The words come up because of questions raised by Hawaii's well-publicized new law that is to make us the first 100 percent renewable energy state by 2045.
\
The ""100 percent"" label clearly appears to be one of the easiest issues to both like and understand. Too bad it is way more complicated than a simple shot of happy news.
\
Last week, after Gov. David Ige announced the state's new opposition to running Hawaii power plants by burning liquefied natural gas, the news set off a round of praise for Hawaii from the environment-focused news media.
\
Newsweek captured the misinformation best as it gushed, ""Hawaii's utilities must generate 100 percent of their electricity from renewable sources.""
\
That is not accurate; what Hawaii must do is comply with a new state law that says the ""renewable portfolio standard shall be 100 percent on Dec. 31, 2045.""
\
The renewable portfolio standard (RPS) is a formula, which, if you must know, is: (Utility renewable energy + rooftop solar)/net sales = RPS.
\
Net sales are defined as gross demand minus rooftop solar.
\
Henry Curtis, Life of the Land executive director and long-time local energy observer, said the new law ""is being marketed as something that it does not do.
\
""Oil, coal and natural gas can still be used to generate electricity in 2046 and beyond.""
\
Yes, even though coal, oil and gas are not renewable, they will still be in use in Hawaii in 2045 even if Hawaii makes it to 100 percent.
\
Now get ready for the N and D words.
\
""The RPS percentage is a fraction, with the numerator equal to the amount of renewable generation on the system and the denominator equal to utility sales. One thing that is not clearly understood is that the numerator and denominator are not defined in the same terms. The numerator is generation. The denominator is sales,"" explained Carl Freedman, Regulatory Reform Working Group Chair of the Hawaii Energy Policy Forum.
\
It all seems complex to the extreme, but the result, as Curtis explained, is that a renewable standard does not mean renewable energy.
\
""An RPS of 100 percent occurs when the kilowatt- hours of rooftop solar generated equals the kilowatt- hours of fossil fuel derived electricity sold by the utility.
\
""Ironically, the more rooftop solar produced, the higher the amounts of fossil fuel-derived electricity that can be sold by the utility,"" Curtis said in an interview.
\
State Rep. Chris Lee, the Kailua Democrat who chairs the House Energy Committee and helped write the new energy law, said it is still working well.
\
""I think a very small percentage will come from fossil fuels in 2045 and I think we are going to beat the goal by several years,"" Lee said in an interview.
\
Energy observers add that Hawaii, under this formula, could have more than 100 percent of its renewable energy portfolio generated by non-carbon-based fuel, which is both a good thing and also why journalists have a basic mistrust of long division.

74,"PROTECTIONS\Renewable-energy law sound\In a June 25 letter, Mr. Dick O'Connell criticized the economic soundness of the Renewable Portfolio Standard bill, or RPS. Gov. Lingle signed Hawai'i's new RPS into law on June 2.\The RPS requires Hawai'i's electric utilities to provide increasing percentages of sales from renewable energy: 8 percent by 2005, 10 percent by 2010, 15 percent by 2015 and 20 percent by 2020.\This electricity will come from such renewable-energy resources as wind, biomass, municipal solid waste (like H-POWER), geo-thermal, hydroelectricity and methane gas from landfills. It includes solar water heating because that replaces the need for electric or gas water heating. Other renewable energy, like hydrogen fuel cells, would also qualify.\Mr. O'Connell could not have been referring to the final version of the bill because SB 2474 SD3 HD2 - the RPS bill that Gov. Lingle signed - did not contain the inaccurate statement he cited about financial benefits to utilities from oil use. It is regrettable that Mr. O'Connell did not see the three protections added to the bill that are intended to avoid increasing the cost of electricity to consumers while also reducing Hawaici's dependence on oil:\- The RPS bill amended an earlier state law that required the PUC to set the price paid by utilities for renewable energy to be above what it cost the utility to generate its own power. To ensure renewable energy under the RPS would be cost-effective, the law was revised so that renewable energy will be produced equal to or less than the utilities' costs. It also conforms Hawai'i law to federal law.\- Every five years, beginning in 2009, renewable-energy experts at the University of Hawaici will conduct a review to consider many factors to determine whether the RPS can be achieved in a cost-effective manner. This report will also be ""peer-reviewed"" by other experts. Based on this independent study, the PUC may revise the percentage of future standards up or down, as appropriate. This process will be used to set standards beyond 2020. These features are unique to Hawaici's new RPS - no other states with RPS laws include this type of protection.\- If an electric utility cannot meet the RPS in a cost-effective manner due to circumstances beyond its control, which could not reasonably be anticipated or ameliorated, the PUC can temporarily waive the standard.\There are many commercial technologies in use today that can use the renewable-energy resources above to cost-effectively produce electricity, or otherwise replace electricity for essential energy, like solar water heating.\In her State of the State address, Gov. Lingle called for a mandate that 20 percent of all electricity sold in the year 2020 comes from renewable sources to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and move our state to the forefront of leading-edge energy policies. Hawai'i's RPS will help ensure greater use of Hawai'i's abundant renewable energy, reduce the impact of volatile world oil markets on our economy, and protect our environment from the impacts of increased fossil fuel use.\The RPS law is a bold step Hawai'i has taken to address serious challenges as world supplies of cheap, conventional oil diminish, especially critical to our Islands - the most oil-dependent state in the nation.\THEODORE E.

Leslie Cole-Brooks: Executive director, Hawaii Solar Energy Association.
\
Leslie Cole-Brooks is executive director of the Hawaii Solar Energy Association, whose 83 business members seem to face unending economic challenges, including likely expiration in 2016 of the 30 percent federal solar investment tax credit for customers, problems with interconnecting to Hawaiian Electric Co.'s energy-distribution grid, and, most recently, the proposed purchase of HECO parent Hawaiian Electric Industries by Florida-based NextEra Energy Co.
\
Cole-Brooks joined the nonprofit trade association in May 2012, and said it has matched well with her vision of years ago to work on issues close to her heart.
\
A graduate of Analy High School in Sebastopol, Calif., she said it was shortly after working with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District in the mid-'90s that she realized ""it was the environment and environmental concerns that really mattered to me."" That's also why, after already earning degrees in geology (University of California, Davis, 1982) and both a graduate certificate in energy management and design (1994) and a master's degree in English from Sonoma State University (1997), she decided to also pursue a law degree.
\
""I was working for an advocacy group that worked on clean water in Northern California,"" she said, ""and I saw that law was where the rubber really met the road. They got stuff done. So I just took the leap.""
\
She learned that the University of Hawaii's law school had one of the nation's best environmental law programs, ""and for me as a swimmer, it was just such an easy decision.""
\
Earning her law degree in 2010, Cole-Brooks went on to work for state Rep. Cynthia Thielen, whom she admired for her work on environmental issues, then worked with her husband Andy in their general contracting business while frequently testifying as an individual at the Legislature on bills that she cared about, some of which related to solar energy.
\
That's how she came to meet HSEA co-founder Cully Judd III, which led to her joining the association, which was founded in 1977 and whose members include ""contractors, installers, distributors, manufacturers, utility and other businesses that are involved with the solar industry.""
\
Cole-Brooks is still active as a swimmer at the Oahu Club in Hawaii, and lives with her husband in Kuliouou Makai.
\
Question: What is the purpose of the Hawaii Solar Energy Association?
\
Answer: Our purpose is to promote the adoption of solar energy for a sustainable economy and a clean energy future. We advocate for all renewables, but our focus is on solar hot water and photovoltaic, commercial and residential, so it's more rooftop, even though some of our members do larger projects as well.
\
Q: How are the members of the association doing right now? Are they mostly healthy?
\
A: It's been a tough couple of years. We had changes with the way the tax credit was administered at the end of 2012, and then there's been ...
\
Q: What happened to the tax credit?
\
A: It's kind of a long story, but there was a change in the way the cap was calculated. ... And it closed a loophole, which I think in the long run it's probably a good thing, but it was more the uncertainty that it caused customers and businesses. ... It's like anything, that a business needs stability, and not the sense that something is going to change that could really impact you in the long run. ...
\
But the real issue has been interconnection, and that's what we have been struggling with these last couple of years. The utility (Hawaiian Electric Co.) has said, ""Wait a minute. We have concerns and issues with the degree of penetration of intermittent resources,"" and things slowed down significantly in 2013, and we're still recovering.
\
Q: Is that about how HECO was delaying approval of interconnections to the grid?
\
A: Yes. It is all part of that. Before this change in the way net energy metering (NEM) was administered, on Oahu you could go and get your installations, get your permits and do all that and then you file your NEM application at the end; you knew that you would get in. But now you need to file the NEM application first and get approval before you install an energizing system, depending on where you are.
\
Q: About the tax credits, what do you think about the idea that ... the solar industry has been getting an unfair government advantage and it's time to start ending those government breaks?
\
A: When I hear that we don't need the tax incentive any more, I think, OK, the purpose of a tax incentive is it's a signal from government that says we want to see this happen. And, in fact, we want to see this happen so badly that we're willing to invest in it and create an incentive for customers to invest their own money on that because it's good for everybody, right?
\
So, OK, I see we've got 12 percent of rooftops (in Hawaii) have some form of photovoltaic, but we have 88 percent that do not. So I don't see that as ""mission accomplished."" I don't see that as being ""we're done now."" So when I hear anyone saying ""we need to get rid of the incentive,"" I ask, ""Oh, I guess we're finished, huh? We're good to go? We're 100 percent renewable, and we've done it all?""
\
Q: You wrote a commentary for the Star-Advertiser in September titled ""Is Hawaiian Electric trying to kill rooftop solar?"" Your conclusion then was what, and what would it be now?
\
A: Well, at that point it seemed the change in the way net energy metering was administered, it was so abrupt and sudden that it caused complete chaos for some time, where companies and customers were trying to adjust and figure out what was what, and also that it really depended on where you were, what your circuit status was ... Now we're working our way through it, and I think that through the DER (distributed energy resources) docket (before the state Public Utilities Commission) that we're making progress; it's just been quite a journey and people have certainly lost their jobs, companies have gone out of business. ... It's hard to say, though, what's coming up ... considering all the things going on with the solar industry.
\
We've got the potential change of control of the utility, and we also have the fact that the ITC, the federal investment tax credit, is about to expire for residential systems at the end of 2016. That's a 30 percent tax credit, money that stays here in the state, money that would have been sent off to the federal government on your taxes. That's 30 percent of the basis of the system which will be pau at the end of 2016, unless there's some kind of change. So how will that affect the industry? How will the PUC respond to the DER docket?
\
Q: What's the DER docket all about?
\
A: ""Distributed energy resources"" is another way to say distributed generation. So it's all about rooftop solar, essentially.
\
Q: Regarding the challenges the industry is facing -- lower prices for fossil fuels would be one of them, too, right?
\
A: Well, yes and no. As a geologist, I know that the cost of fossil fuels is only going to go up. And maybe we have this interim period because of what's been happening with geopolitics, but the cost of fossil fuels is going to go up. And Hawaii will always be the most isolated island on the planet, and we will probably always have the highest rates in the nation so long as we are beholden to imported fossil fuels. So to stall our progress right now, getting to 100 percent renewables, because fossil fuel prices are lower, would be a huge mistake.
\
I don't really see that as an issue. I see more the interconnection process and the utility business model and how does the utility adjust to the fact that people can generate their own electricity, and how do we now interact with the utility in a way that is a true collaboration to use all these distributed resources in a way that's a benefit for everybody?
\
Q: How decentralized can we really go?
\
A: That's a great question. Rather, I should say that is the question. The old business model where the utility generates and you buy, and then they send you a bill and you send them a check, that's just gone. And that was great. It was a great party, but now it's done. So now what do we do?
\
This is what's been happening, and, again, it's in the distributed energy resource docket, in phase two, which will be entered soon, where the Public Utilities Commission, along with the utility and all the intervenors, are going to look at the metrics that matter: How much does it cost to keep the grid alive and well, and how much should each individual customer pay in order to be keep this system going?
\
Q: There's this sense that people with net metering are not really paying their fair share for the grid. Is that right?
\
A: We keep hearing that, and our response is, ""Let's please do the analysis to find out what is the right rate.""
\
And the other question is, in terms of distributed resources, ""What is the value of these resources as it pertains to what they give to the grid?"" We only hear about what they call the cost shift ... and it's always said in this way that's final and determined and everyone agrees. But it should be not ""cost shift,"" but rather ""cost shift?"" -- with a question mark at the end. What is it, how is it calculated and what about all of the benefits that distributed generation does and can provide to the grid? That's really an answer to your question about how decentralized can we go. So it's really exciting. That's where we're going and it's new territory.
\
Q: Does it require a big technological advance -- batteries or something?
\
A: Yes, it does. If we're going to get to a 100 percent RPS (renewable portfolio standards) by 2045 or sooner, we absolutely have to have storage. ... Most of the time (in Hawaii) we have this incredible ... cornucopia of resources, right? We have the sun, wind, geothermal, biomass, waves, and we'll have OTEC someday. It's amazing. But unfortunately the generation doesn't always match the load. So what do you do ... if you don't need all that power? We need to store it. ... We need a way to capture that wealth and use it later.
\
Q: What do you think of the proposed NextEra buyout of HEI?
\
A: We're very concerned. When I first filed my motion to intervene, ... I was neutral. ... I wanted to give it a chance. But in ... my direct testimony on behalf of HSEA, I came out against this new control and stated it is not in the public interest.
\
Our concern is really Florida Power and Light's record in Florida -- Florida, the sunshine state, right? Here in Hawaii, we have 12-13 percent of solar on residential roof space, and in Florida, it's something like 0.5 percent of residential customers. ... And they have this huge AC load. So there's this real mismatch. ... But that's the take of what's been happening in Florida, and what's been happening with their efficiency standards, which were severely downgraded. Then there're concerns about PPAs (power purchasing agreements) and the fact that they can't do third-party transactions. Will they behave the same way when they come to Hawaii?
\
Q: Could it be any worse than the way it is right now?
\
A: Yes, absolutely. You know, working with HECO we've had our struggles, but again I think it goes back to the business model, that they're trying to apply an old model to the new reality and utilities aren't known for being these innovative, nimble startups, you know?
\
Q: Speaking of where we want to go, do you really think the 2045 goal to be 100 percent RPS is achievable?
\
A: Yes. We have to do it.
\
Q: You don't think there's a place at all for fossil fuels -- God's gift from the ground?
\
A: (Laughter) Oh yes, there is a place for fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are what fueled the Industrial Revolution, right?
\
Q: Right, and in the Third World, especially, they still need that stuff pretty bad.
\
A: Well, in the 100 percent RPS bill, there are caveats, that it's not what we're going to do no matter what happens. What it is, is it sets the goal and it sets the intention of where we want to go. And I a hundred percent believe that we need to set the goal and the intention, and ... yes, I can see us getting there. I think Hawaii can do it.
\
First of all, we have the resources, which I talked about before. We have the perfect climate. We have the financial driver because of our high electric rates, which aren't going to go down; we have the continued vulnerability of relying on fossil fuels that are coming from elsewhere; and I just think Hawaii has the heart. I think that people care about the environment here, and they see that as a goal that we can embrace. ... Now the hard work begins.

76," Businesses around the country are stepping up to address social, political and environmental issues at a level not seen in generations. This is especially evident in Hawaii, where our geography and culture reinforce the value we place on a fair society and a healthy environment. \ Yet climate change, social justice and responsible governance are global issues, not just local ones. It’s no longer enough for Hawaii to look out for our own interests; we must share our experiences on the global stage, to set an example for others grappling with these very serious challenges. \ One example of Hawaii’s leadership is the Aloha+ Challenge, led by Hawai‘i Green Growth. Aloha+ Challenge is a statewide sustainability framework promoting the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Recognized by the United Nations, the Aloha+ Challenge has been held up as a model for island economies as it tackles such challenges as energy and food security, waste management and economic growth. \ In the corporate world, culture and values translate into policies that govern the way a business is conducted, its impact on the natural environment, the types of people it hires and the way those people treat one another, and the investments it makes. In recent years, companies have begun making information like this available in environmental, social and governance (ESG) reports that document their societal and sustainability impacts. \ HEI released its second annual ESG report on Earth Day 2021. Alexander & Baldwin, Hawaiian Airlines, Matson and other local companies have begun sharing similar information. We are doing this because people want to know that the companies that they buy goods from or who provide services to them are operating in ways that are pono and good for our communities and the generations that will come after us. \ Hawaii has led the nation in setting ambitious climate agendas, with a goal to achieve a 100% renewable portfolio standard (RPS) and a carbon-neutral economy by 2045. As the utility serving 95% of our state, Hawaiian Electric plays a central role in the state’s ability to meet these goals. The year 2045 may seem a long way off, but our near-term progress should give us all cause for optimism. We’re aligned with the state’s goals, surpassing the state’s RPS requirement of 30% and reaching 35% RPS in 2020. And last year, despite the disruption caused by the pandemic, we installed 56% more rooftop solar systems than the prior year. \ With regard to social impact, American Savings Bank has undertaken a number of initiatives to strengthen the community. These range from financing affordable housing, to creating a free online resource to help people learn how to better manage their personal finances. \ We often hear about how Hawaii lags behind its mainland and global counterparts in a variety of areas. Yet when it comes to ESG, Hawaii has demonstrated alaka‘i — setting a good example for others to follow. \ This Earth Day, I join with my colleagues in the Hawaii business community as we continue to advance our ambitious environmental, social and governance initiatives within our own organizations and with our partners across the state, and to share our collective accomplishments and experiences with the rest of the world so that everyone can benefit from what we’re learning and doing. \ Connie Lau is president and CEO of Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. "
77," Ulupono Initiative, the impact investment firm created in 2009 by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and his wife Pam, marks its 10th anniversary this year. The company has been busy; as of the end of 2018, Ulupono has built up a $78 million-plus portfolio of projects to advance its ambitious agenda to make Hawaii more self-sustaining through large-scale investments in locally grown food, renewable energy and more efficient waste management. \ The firm has invested in projects as diverse as open-ocean kanpachi farming, seawater air conditioning and a cooperative of ulu (breadfruit) growers that has increased commercial production of the Hawaiian staple. Most recently, Ulupono set up a partnership with Hawaii Energy to offer limited-time rebates for installing electric vehicle charging stations at workplaces and multifamily dwellings. \ Much of the responsibility for Ulupono’s future investments will fall on Greg Gaug, an executive with a finance background who just assumed the title of senior vice president for investment and analytics as part of a corporate restructuring. \ “I joined Ulupono because I wanted to utilize the skills and knowledge I have accumulated to try and make a difference,” Gaug said. \ Sometimes making a difference can be difficult. Ulupono’s efforts to revive Hawaii’s once-thriving but now-moribund dairy industry through a new Kauai dairy farm encountered fierce pushback from the community as well as legal and regulatory challenges. Ulupono ultimately abandoned the project, while reportedly earning about $875,000 in tax credits. But not all was lost, Gaug said: “We made … significant investments in that property that will last well beyond the dairy,” including water infrastructure for irrigation that will improve the value of the land for farming, “whether that’s for dairy or for fruits and vegetables.” \ Gaug, 38, an Akron, Ohio, native, “bounced around quite a bit before making Oahu home,” he said. “Having lived in several different places I can truly say that being on small islands in the middle of the Pacific definitely gives you a unique perspective.” \ He met his future wife, who is from Kalihi, in San Francisco. They now live in Kailua with two young children and a third on the way. \ “I really love doing what I’m doing, and hopefully creating a better community and world for my kids to inherit,” he said. \ Question: How would you distinguish between investment strategies by Ulupono and those of the for-profit business sector? \ Answer: It’s a common misconception that Ulupono Initiative is a nonprofit, which isn’t surprising because our mission to improve Hawaii’s sustainability comes first. As an impact investment firm, Ulupono invests with purpose, and we reinvest any returns back into the work. \ Ulupono’s diverse portfolio comprises nonprofit, for-profit and social investments in mission-focused projects. These investments are selected because they facilitate sound, innovative, community-based ideas with the greatest potential to catapult Hawaii toward catalytic change. \ Q: What do you envision as a sustainable model for electric vehicles (EVs) in Hawaii and supporting networks of charging stations? \ A: The current challenge in supporting networks of charging stations is that electric vehicles (EVs) account for less than 1 percent of all light-weight vehicles on our roads (there are just under 9,000 plug-in vehicles), so it’s tough to get high utilization at any one station. However, the market is seeing 26 percent annual growth, so … increased use should make charging stations more financially viable. I think it will be a mix of private (charge at home), workplace (charge during the day), as well as convenient charging (commercial and retail), and corridor (location-based). \ There are significant benefits if we can charge EVs during the day to capture peak solar power here in the state, so I really like the workplace charging option. \ Q: If EV owners are willing to pay a fee for charger usage, why does government need to provide incentives to install them? \ A: Our research indicated that 68 percent of EV owners are receptive to paying for charging. However, given the low utilization, it is challenging to recoup the relatively high upfront costs related to installing and operating a charging station. So government incentives in these early years can be very effective in encouraging property owners to make the investment. To be clear, the government incentives are not intended to cover 100 percent of the costs — the site owner is still investing out of their own pocket. I believe charging stations have the potential to be self-sustaining once we have strong EV penetration. I would still consider EVs an emerging market until it reaches about 10 percent of all cars on the road. \ Q: What happens to batteries when they end their useful life (currently about 10 years)? \ A: EV batteries end their “useful life” around 20-30 percent degradation, so they still have 70-80 percent capacity left. They are often repurposed into other solutions such as aggregated into a larger, utility-scale battery or used as a portable charging station as seen in Freewire. This extends their useful life for another 20-30 years. Though at some point, disposal could create a challenge, which is why a number of universities and companies are researching recycling technology. Right now recycling is technologically feasible but economies of scale are the challenge. \ Q: How realistic is the goal of eliminating fossil fuels from ground transportation by 2045, a goal set by Hawaii’s four county mayors? \ A: Honestly, I think it’s very realistic to eliminate fossil fuels from ground transportation. My only hesitation is due to the reality that the shift is reliant on vehicle turnover, which can take eight to 12 years. And to be clear, some folks will hold onto their gasoline vehicles (like collectors). However, in context, when the initial RPS (renewable portfolio standard) goals were set in 2008, not many people thought those were realistic. Then, over the last decade, the goals were increased to 100 percent and still at the time, there were many skeptics. Now, the discussion has turned to not IF but WHEN. I think if the same focus, energy and commitment can be put into ground transportation, we’d see similar momentum and confidence that this can be achieved. \ Q: Realistically, what’s the outlook for mass public transportation converting to “green” systems? \ A: The outlook is very strong. Electric buses are already in a number of municipalities. We recently had pilot buses on the roads here in Honolulu, and the counties are planning and evaluating how to best incorporate electric buses into their fleets. Unlike most consumers, public transit agencies really focus on total lifecycle costs and electric buses are very competitive over the life of the vehicle. \ Q: Given cancellation of its plans to establish a Kauai dairy farm, does Ulupono still want to promote and/or invest in dairy farming in Hawaii? \ A: We absolutely support a local dairy industry. Unfortunately I don’t think most folks realize that nearly all of our milk is now imported from California. By the time milk hits the shelves it might be as many as 20-30 days old. The recent milk shortage further highlights the need to support local agriculture and a local dairy industry. A significant portion of Hawaii residents relies on dairy — especially the very young and our elderly population who require it for its nutritional value as a whole food product. I want to give my kids fresh, healthy milk, so hopefully we can find a balance between being environmental responsible and supporting local ag, which we believe our sustainable Kauai dairy farm proposal encompassed. \ Q: Does Ulupono have plans to invest in other agriculture-related ventures? If so, what are they? \ A: We are always looking to support agriculture ventures that can provide large impact opportunities. We like controlled agriculture environments such as greenhouses or vertical agriculture. Though they may require more upfront capital, they reduce operational risk, plus require less land and water. But such operations must be scalable to make a difference in feeding Hawaii’s population and increase our self-sufficiency. Without being scalable, it’s just gardening. "
78,"
ONE of the key issues of the legislative session is energy: where it comes from, what it costs and how it is produced. To keep our state's economy moving, we need to find ways to conserve and we need to explore new energy sources. The ideas are in place, the laws are on the books -- our task for the future is putting ideas into practice.
\
I am pleased to learn that Governor Lingle views alternative energy and fuel conservation as essential elements in her legislative package, and that her administration is prepared to build upon the work the Legislature has done in recent years to advance those goals.
\
As chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy, Environment and International Affairs, I have introduced legislation over the years aimed at:
\
» reducing Hawaii's dependence on fossil fuels;
\
» moving the state toward the use of renewable energy, and setting realistic deadlines for meeting that goal;
\
» creating incentives for private industry to develop alternative sources of energy; and
\
» mandating the application of energy-efficient, environmentally sound practices to the construction of new state buildings.
\
Hawaii's energy situation is critical. We burn more oil to produce electricity than any other state. Our geographic isolation makes us especially vulnerable to disruptions in the worldwide production of oil. We have a potentially crippling dependence on forces far beyond our control.
\
Alternative energy, then, would seem to be a goal everyone could embrace. Solar and wind power, biomass and ocean energy all have tremendous potential. As new systems come on line, the cost of energy is bound to drop. Yet Hawaii has moved slowly toward energy self-sufficiency. The opposition has come from those with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, but their arguments lose value with each passing year. It's unrealistic to expect that the price of fossil fuels will drop in the future; experience suggests that it has nowhere to go but up.
\
A key concept in energy reform is the ""renewable portfolio standard."" This is the notion that a certain percentage of the state's energy should come from renewable sources, combined with a timeline for that goal to be reached. Hawaii has adopted an RPS of 20 percent by the end of 2020. The measure that is currently in place is flawed, and fixing it will be one of my top priorities for the current legislative session. As written, it has loopholes that will slow its implementation. Once those are closed, we will have meaningful legislation. Renewable energy has met its share of resistance in the past, but times have changed.
\
""Net energy metering"" is another energy reform that is now on the books. Like the renewable portfolio standard, it will offer real savings to the consumer as soon as key decisions are made about how it will be administered. Net energy metering encourages the use of renewable energy generators by making renewable energy cost-effective -- a key principle behind the state's new focus on energy reform.
\
Another idea that is coming to the fore is the LEED standard for the development of sustainable, energy efficient construction methods. LEED stands for ""leadership in energy and environmental design,"" and it's another example of energy reform that has met with its share of opposition through the years. The administration now recognizes that construction that applies the LEED standard pays for itself in a very short time and leads to significant savings for Hawaii's taxpayers over the long haul.
\
The Hawaii Energy Policy Forum has created a comprehensive 10-point plan that charts a course for Hawaii's energy future. It calls for the development of renewable energy sources from material already available to us. It encourages the development of solar energy, hydrogen, ethanol and bio-fuels. It strikes a balance between sound energy policy and the energy needs of Hawaii's people. It commits the state to investment in sustainable communities and the reduction of energy costs. Details can be found online at www.hawaiienergypolicy.hawaii.edu/.
\
Whether in the development of renewable energy sources or building construction, Hawaii's state government can lead the way. Government is in a unique position to set standards, create incentives, establish timelines and lead by example. I'm delighted to see that there's an apparent sea change in the administration's attitude toward renewable energy.
\
Despite the undeniable crisis conditions we face, there is reason to hope. For the first time in our history, we have the bipartisan political will to move the state toward energy self-sufficiency. I look forward to working with the administration as we move from the idea stage to the real work before us: the implementation of sound ideas whose time has finally come.

"
79,"\\Two years ago, Gov. David Ige signed into law a bill that directs the state’s utilities to generate 100 percent of their electricity sales from renewable energy resources by 2045 - an ambitious mandate for the most petroleum- dependent state in the nation.\Hawaii’s electricity generation is dominated by fossil fuels. And due to the continued costs tied to importing most of the energy used throughout the state, ratepayers shoulder the highest prices nationwide - more than twice the U.S. average.\But with the clean energy law in place, amid stops and starts, a transition to a fuller, homegrown renewable portfolio for the electricity sector, which promises to better the islands’ economy, environment and energy security, is now underway. For example, today nearly 1 in 3 single-family dwellings here produces power from the sun, with about 80,000 solar systems operating.\Meeting the 2045 deadline also means lowering overall electrical consumption by stepping up efficiency efforts.\ENERGY CONSERVATION CODE\Hawaii’s new energy code is based on the 2015 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) - a model code adopted by many states and municipal governments, which sets minimum design and construction requirements for energy efficiency.\Among the recent statewide upgrades:\>> Compared to the current code (in place since 2006), it reduces energy use up to 33 percent.\>> Savings will add up, year after year. By 2045, the cumulative statewide energy savings will be more than $1 billion.\>> Hotel-related amendments address open lanai doors, hotel room efficiencies and AC use in unenclosed spaces.\>> Better walls, roofs and windows allow smaller AC systems.\>> Reflective and/or shaded walls allow single-wall construction, and are allowed in lieu of wall insulation.\>> Optimized “Tropical Zone” home uses 52 percent as much energy as a fully compliant AC-cooled home. This zone allows ceiling fans in lieu of AC, and jalousie windows.\Source: Hawaii Energy Office\Earlier this year, Ige signed an administrative rule for an updated energy conservation code. (After counties sign off on a version of it, the code will guide new construction and a large slice of residential, commercial and state building renovation.) The previous code was based on 2006 state industry standards.\Much has changed since then to push forward green-minded technology.\For example, most lights used 11 years ago were incandescent bulbs. Today LEDs - touted as an energy-efficiency superhero - are the standard, costing a fraction what they did a decade ago and needing a fraction of the energy that incandescents use.\Among significant changes in the code: a new lighting requirement and a “tighter” building envelope (walls, windows and roofs), which more effectively keep the sun’s heat out, said Howard Wiig, an energy analyst in the state Energy Office.\The old code had no residential lighting requirement. Now: 75 percent of the lights must be high efficiency, “effectively barring incandescents,” said Wiig, adding, “This has the secondary effect of reducing the heat load caused by lighting.”\Ramsey Brown, an energy engineer at Hawai‘i Energy, a program that helps reduce electricity use by providing free or low-cost efficient appliances and other products, points to the code’s residential “Tropical Zone” as a step forward.\“This new requirement is a nod back to more simple construction where it incorporates Hawaii’s tropical breezes as a way to effectively cool a home, along with installing large overhangs to shade windows and sliding doors,” Brown said.\For commercial properties, he said, “commissioning (the process of verifying and documenting the meeting of code requirements) will play a larger role moving forward. Buildings have more complexity, such as intelligent lighting and air conditioning controls, which require fine-tuning and accurate adjustments for efficient and comfortable operation.”\It will cost more to build to the new code, but in the case of homes, that spending can be recouped in energy savings in an estimated 4.3 years. Across-the-board statewide savings, according to the state Energy Office, could total more than $1.4 billion in energy costs over the next 20 years.\The Honolulu Star-Advertiser asked Blue Planet Foundation, a clean-energy focused nonprofit, and the state’s dominant electric utility, Hawaiian Electric Co., to weigh in on progress toward the state’s renewable goal.\FOSSIL FUELS AND RENEWABLES\According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s latest figures, less than 1 percent of electricity in the United States was generated using oil in 2015. By contrast, Hawaii relied on fossil fuels - oil and coal, nearly 70 percent and 13 percent, respectively - for most of its electricity generation. Fossil fuels, which emit carbon dioxide when burned, contribute to environmental problems, including global warming.\WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE TOP STRIDES SINCE THE 2015 LAW TOOK EFFECT?\Jeff Mikulina, executive director, Blue Planet Foundation: \First, simply setting the 100 percent renewable goal reshaped the energy agenda in Hawaii. It changed the conversation about what’s possible - not only in Hawaii, but elsewhere around the globe (California, for instance, is currently deliberating an identical 100 percent mandate). By setting the 100 percent vision, energy stakeholders were able to move past unproductive squabbles about where we are headed so that we can work productively on the “how” details. The law has fostered collaboration and aligned our energy planning with climate reality.\Second, with the law on the books, Hawaii has telegraphed that it is open for clean energy business and innovation. We saw the results of this when the utility cooperative on Kauai, KIUC, inked deals for some of the first-ever solar plus storage projects. These are game­changers on our journey to 100 percent renewable, upending traditional beliefs about clean energy (not dependable, too expensive).\What makes these projects remarkable is not only that they will provide solar energy at night, but they will provide solar at night at prices that beat fossil fuel. The first project with Tesla, which came online this year, provides 13 megawatts of power and 52 megawatt- hours of energy at a price of 13.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. The second project with AES (the same company that owns the coal-fired power plant on Oahu), currently under development, is twice as large in size and storage capacity - but at a lower price of 11 cents per kilowatt-hour. … Our cleanest energy future may also be our cheapest.\Scott Seu, senior vice president of public affairs, Hawaiian Electric Co.: \The 2015 RPS (renewable portfolio standards) mandate was that 15 percent of electricity sales had to come from renewables, and we exceeded that and hit 23 percent. The three Hawaiian Electric Companies are now at 26 percent and we’re still moving forward. Hawaii Electric Light is at 54 percent, the highest in the state, and Maui Electric is almost at 40 percent.\I’d say another important success is how we’ve revamped how we talk to our customers and other stakeholders on creating the roadmaps for getting to 100 percent renewables, like the Power Supply Improvement Plan or grid modernization.\The traditional approach for us engineers is that we start by focusing on the operational and technical issues, come up with the plans and solutions, and then we say: “Here you go.” In this day and age people expect a lot more than that; they want more of a say. What we’re trying to do now is to first ask our communities and customers: “What do you want?” and then go from there.\WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE TOP STALL OR DISAPPOINTMENT?\Blue Planet: Shortly after adopting the 100 percent renewable energy law, the state and utility throttled Hawaii’s biggest clean energy success story: rooftop solar. The policy of net energy metering drove the rapid widespread adoption of solar for households and businesses across the state. In 2007, Hawaiian Electric estimated that through net metering, rooftop solar would grow 20-fold by the end of 2015; instead it grew over 350 times as large as it was in 2007.\… That policy catalyzed over $1 billion in private investment in helping reduce the state’s dependence on fossil fuels. But that solar growth came to a screeching halt in October 2015 when Hawaii became the first state to end the net metering policy. The move devastated the local solar industry, which at one time represented one-quarter of all construction jobs in the islands, forcing the layoff of hundreds of employees. While solar may still rebound with new policies and programs, we’ve essentially taken away the most powerful tool expanding renewable energy and democratizing energy choice.\HECO: In the early days of our clean energy movement there was quick progress almost across the board. Anything from adding rooftop solar to wind farms to solar farms to expansion of geothermal and waste to energy. But as we added renewables, we started to experience technical challenges and had to slow things down while we figured those out, because above all, the lights have to stay on. We’re making really good progress and pushing ahead, but I think everyone would like this to move faster.\The other area where I wish we’d make quicker progress is getting clean energy to become a true third leg of our economy alongside tourism and government, where clean technologies and intellectual property are actually created and produced in Hawaii, and we export this know-how so that revenues flow into the state. We can be so much more than just consumers of clean tech developed outside Hawaii. It would be great to marry up our clean energy policies with economic development policies.\WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE UPDATED ENERGY CONSERVATION CODE?\Blue Planet: While we are supportive of this critical update … Blue Planet Foundation recognizes that the new building standards don’t go far enough - they leave a lot of money (and energy waste) on the table, and they aren’t anticipating the coming evolution of how buildings interact with the energy grid.\Buildings built today will be with us in 2045 and beyond. We should strive for zero net energy buildings - or even energy positive buildings that produce more energy than they consume. New buildings today should enable the building to interact with the modern energy grid, including “demand response” control technologies (that turn off noncritical loads for a short period to help balance the energy grid) and technologies that are responsive to dynamic energy pricing.\Also, buildings should have grid-interactive electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, or at least be “EV ready,” to smooth the deployment of our renewable transportation future.\HECO: This (updated code) is a good thing, in that it reminds us all of the critical importance of energy efficiency. The cheapest kilowatt-hour of electricity is the one that you don’t use, and I really believe that too much of our attention gets focused on how we produce more renewable energy.\The mantra has always been to invest in energy efficiency first - lighting, smart thermostats, solar hot water - since you get more bang for your buck, and then you work on renewable energy generation. Without energy efficiency, our 100 percent renewable energy target will be much higher, and getting there will be much more expensive.\Get the latest news by email Sign Up\Credit: By Maureen O’Connell"
