CARLSBAD -- Words such as ""utmost foolishness,"" ""an abomination,"" ""greed,"" ""stupidity,"" ""nonsense"" and ""grossly unfair,"" were fired at representatives from the New Mexico Environment Department who were in Carlsbad Tuesday to gather comments on the department's cap and trade petition and cap-only petition.
\
The ""cap"" is a legal limit on the quantity of greenhouse gases that a region can emit each year and ""trade"" means that companies may swap among themselves the permission -- or permits -- to emit greenhouse gases.
\
Representatives from the potash, oil and gas industries, local and state government, business leaders and ordinary citizens spoke strongly against the petitions.
\
They said if the cap and trade measure is passed, it will cost more to do business in New Mexico, jobs would be lost and oil and gas companies will flee the state and drill elsewhere.
\
Representatives from Intrepid Potash and the Potash Association of New Mexico said NMED has no science to back up the need for cap and trade and no studies have been conducted to determine the benefits to the state.
\
""In addition to business and industry, cap and trade is detrimental to all our citizens,"" said Steve McCutcheon, Potash Association of New Mexico chairman and a Carlsbad resident. ""The benefit to our state is unknown, and there still will be pollution coming from our neighboring states of Texas, Arizona and Colorado. You have no science to back up what you are doing, yet you are going forward with this without much thought.""
\
Wayne Ballard, a local contractor, drew applause from the audience at the close of his comments.
\
""The Environment Improvement Board, appointed by the New Mexico Environmental Department -- part of the current Richardson-Denish administration -- is espousing the mass stupidity that brings us here today,"" he said. ""It is fostering sedition against the temporary occupants of our state capital. In the past, people who tried to do so much harm to a state were tarred, feathered and run out of state on a rail. Anyone who would try to cripple the economy of New Mexico should be treated no better, as what they are attempting to do is nothing less than treason.""
\
Ballard said that Albuquerque and Santa Fe, which would be exempt from the cap and trade, should be very careful about what they let happen to southeastern New Mexico.
\
""We, down here, know that if anything adversely affects potash mines and the oil and gas industry, the northern part of the state will suffer, greatly reducing the tax revenue that they so richly enjoy,"" he said.
\
Ballard said the NMED should prove its worth and trust and added, ""Be a responsible patriot and change your stance on this abomination. Let us hope that common sense prevails over greed and stupidity. These proposed regulations would have a devastating effect on our future economy. These regulations, if passed, will make us the laughing stock of the entire nation. This cannot be allowed to happen.""
\
Louise Tracy, a former city councilwoman whose family has agriculture holdings in Eddy County, said everything the NMED does has a direct effect on her family.
\
""You want to change the Pecos River into something that it has never had -- sweet water. You want to kill the extractive industries such as potash, oil and gas and coal with the cap and trade proposals,"" she said. ""These industries make your lifestyles possible.""
\
She said that she is looking forward to a change in the current administration in November and added, ""This petition, I believe, is just one last nail that Gov. Richardson wants to nail into industries that he hates.""
\
Carlsbad retiree Wayne Hughes said that in addition to Albuquerque and Santa Fe receiving an exemption, the cap and trade petition also exempts the Indian Nation and the coal plant that sits on its land.
\
The coal plant is considered to be the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the state, according to Rep. John Heaton, D-Carlsbad.
\
""It's grossly unfair,"" Hughes said. ""The Indian Nation is sovereign when it comes to the coal plant, but it's not sovereign when it comes to federal health care and education funding. As for Albuquerque and Santa Fe, if they are tired of their brothers down here, then we can make Las Cruces our state capital.""
\
Representing the Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, Russell Hardy said if the cap and trade was to be implemented on a national scale, he would not have a problem with it. However, New Mexico should not be a lone state for cap and trade regulations.
\
He said it would hurt the economy in Eddy County and other rural areas in the part of the state where the extractive industries provide jobs and help fuel the economy.
\
Heaton, who serves on the New Mexico House Energy Committee, said the committee has heard bills for the past three years concerning greenhouse gas emissions and cap and trade proposals. He said all met defeat, yet the NMED continues to push for these types of regulations.
\
He said there is strong opposition to the cap and trade petition, yet at a time when the state has significant financial problems, money is being wasted on hearings such as the one held in Artesia and Carlsbad on Tuesday.

SANTA FE - The New Mexico Environment Department has released a proposed draft rule for a cap and trade program aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The department has yet to file the proposal with the state Environmental Improvement Board, which would have to approve the measure.
\
The proposal defines the conditions that would allow New Mexico to implement a cap and trade program as part of the Western Climate Initiative regional program.
\
One condition is New Mexico will only participate if there are enough pollution allowances within the WCI to make the program efficient and cost effective. The WCI includes 10 other states and Canadian provinces.
\
The program would initially apply only to sources that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide per year.
\
The department is asking for public comment on the draft rule.

SANTA FE - The New Mexico Environment Department says a new regulation to cap and trade greenhouse gas emissions is necessary if the state wants to limit the potential impacts of climate change.
\
The department started presenting its case to the state Environmental Improvement Board on Monday. The hearing continues Tuesday in Santa Fe and is expected to last through next week.
\
The board sided with the department Monday by approving a motion to strike testimony from one expert who was scheduled to speak on behalf of the Coalition of Arizona/New Mexico Counties for Stable Economic Growth, which opposes the state's plan.
\
The department argued the witness misrepresented himself and lacked credentials to testify.
\
Outside the hearing, Farmington City Councilor Jason Sandel and other critics rallied, saying such a regulation would harm New Mexico's economy.

CARLSBAD -- As people in the state were going to the polls Tuesday, the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board met and quietly adopted a cap and trade program to cut greenhouse gases, a move that is strongly opposed by business and industry in the state.
\
Rep. Bill Gray, R-Eddy and Otero counties, who has fought against the measure, said given the make up of the board, the cap and trade program was destined to pass.
\
He said the unelected board serves at the pleasure of outgoing Gov. Bill Richardson who pushed for cap and trade. Gray said he expects Richardson will sign off on the cap and trade plan before he leaves office.
\
""I don't believe this (greenhouse gas pollution reduction regulations) will have any affect on global climate - not one bit. What it will do is cause New Mexico to lose jobs and revenue. The oil and gas industry will look to drill in other states and build new refineries. Getting New Mexico to be the first U.S. state to get it passed will look good on Gov. Richardson's resume.""
\
John Waters, Carlsbad Department of Development executive director, said the adoption of the regulations on Election Day was a ""sneaky thing to do"" and a ""major slap in the face"" for rural New Mexico.
\
The regulations exclude Albuquerque.
\
""I am very disappointed that they decided to push it through when a big portion of New Mexico - especially southern New Mexico - provide the state with a lot of oil and gas revenue,"" Waters said.
\
""Cap and trade is not going to help New Mexico,"" he added. ""It's going to adversely affect the state. Cap and trade should have been a federal government decision on a national level. Instead, New Mexico passed it first, saying: 'Hey, look at us. Look what we can do.' This is nothing more than a show. What they should have done is show the cost benefits before passing this. If it is going to protect the environment, they should show us how and have the data to back it up. But they haven't done any of that. You can't just do it to make a political statement. Cap and trade is not going to help air quality in New Mexico.""
\
He said the board is stacked with environmentalists and passage of the regulations was inevitable
\
Gray said Gov.-elect Susana Martinez is against cap and trade and is looking at ways to reverse the board's decision.
\
Martinez told the Albuquerque Journal this week that ""I will do everything to research how it is we are able to put a moratorium, or however it is we can put a repeal to that regulation. ""
\
""I hope she eliminates the board and appoints her own board members and hopefully, undo what the previous board has done,"" Gray said.
\
He said the public hearings held by the board around the state to gather input on the proposed cap and trade initiative was a waste of time and taxpayers' money.
\
""It was just a formality,"" Gray said. ""They were going to pass it anyway. We had over 600 people in Artesia and Carlsbad attend the public hearings that were held here. Everyone who spoke at the hearing was opposed to cap and trade. The board apparently chose not to listen. They just rubber stamped cap and trade on the instructions of the governor.""
\
According to the New Mexico Environment Department, the members of the Environmental Improvement Board are not directly answerable to the people of New Mexico. The seven board members are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the state senate. In addition, ""The members of the board are appointed for overlapping terms, with no term exceeding five years. No more than four members are appointed from any one political party.""
\
Of the current seven members, all but two of those currently listed are Santa Fe residents.
\
Gray said although the Republicans still don't have the majority in the House and Senate, Tuesday's elections removed several Democrats from the Legislature, giving the Republicans a few more people in both houses.
\
""I think we will have the votes on both sides of the aisle to break this thing (cap and trade program),"" Gray said.
\
Gray said cap and trade will be devastating to the oil and gas industry in New Mexico, especially in southeastern New Mexico, where the industry is very active. He said cap and trade will also be devastating to the two refineries in New Mexico. Their competition in the Texas Panhandle, El Paso and Big Spring, Texas, will have a significant competitive advantage over the New Mexico refineries.
\
""I was at a meeting just recently and a large petroleum company representative talked to me about the possibility of building a refinery in Eddy County,"" Gray said. ""This was just days before the board approved the cap and trade program. He said if New Mexico has a cap and trade program he will probably look for a refinery site in Texas. The potential for a new refinery in Eddy County is huge. It means more jobs and revenue. But cap and trade could lose that for us.""
\
Gray said the cap and trade program is scheduled to start in 2012 and he is hopeful the incoming administration will be able to stop the measure that, according to the New Mexico Environment Department, is ""the most comprehensive greenhouse gas pollutions reduction regulations in the nation.""
\
The department said the new regulations adopted by the board will enable the state to participate in a regional greenhouse gas cap and trade program with other U.S. states and Canadian provinces through the Western Climate Initiative (WCI). The WCI is a collaborative of seven western states and four Canadian provinces that are developing strategies to address climate change.
\
According to the Environment Department the cap and trade regulations will affect about 63 large industrial sources in New Mexico. Those sources include electric generators and the largest emission sources in the oil and gas sector. Each source would have to reduce its emissions by 2 percent until 2020 or acquire emissions credits from other participants.
\
The program will not be triggered unless at least 100 million tons of emissions are included regionally, which ensures that New Mexico will not implement a trading program alone.
\
Richardson said in a press release that he is happy with the board's action.
\
""I am pleased that the EIB adopted the program I have worked so hard to develop,"" he said. ""I call on the federal government to build on New Mexico's programs and the WCI to implement a national cap and trade program.""

CARLSBAD -- Legislators representing Eddy County, local government officials and industry and business leaders have come out in opposition to a cap and trade petition proposed by the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board.
\
The Eddy County Commission in recent months passed two resolutions opposing the petition and, along with a letter, submitted them to the NMED Board. In addition, a representative for the county testified at a recent hearing on the impact it would have in Eddy County if the petition were to be implemented.
\
On Tuesday, the Carlsbad City Council also came out in opposition, voting to submit a letter to the NMED.
\
Russell Hardy, representing the Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce, in his letter to the editor published Friday in the Current-Argus, explained the petition.
\
""The petition, as currently written, would apply only to rural businesses and industries that produce more than 250,000 tons of CO2 annually and would exempt businesses operating in Albuquerque, Santa Fe and on sovereign Indian Nations,"" he explained.
\
""Businesses and industries in our area that would be impacted would include potash mines, Navajo refineries in Artesia and Lovington, Excel Energy generating stations in Lea County, not to mention large-scale manufacturing, mining and utility businesses throughout the rural regions of the state.""
\
Eddy County Commissioner Lewis Derrick, a rancher in north Eddy County, said the Environment Department's petition will hurt the local economy and will have a far-reaching effect if it passes.
\
""I'm looking at this from the possibility of this petition wrecking our tax base and running off businesses,"" Derrick said. ""It's going to impact not only the oil and gas industry. It will impact farmers, ranchers and the trucking industry. The state should stay out of our business. They need to back off this. It's mind boggling that they would do this to the people of New Mexico.""
\
County Manager Allen Sartin said the wind blows across the border from Arizona and other bordering states, and along with it comes pollutants in the air. He said in order to truly minimize greenhouse gases, similar action would need to be implemented by every state or by federal action for all states to comply.
\
Rep. Bill Gray, R-Eddy and Otero
\
Rep. Bill Gray, R-Eddy and Otero Counties, sent a letter to the Environmental Improvement Board chastising it for its proposed petition.
\
""This is another prime example of why New Mexico is considered an anti-business state,"" he wrote. ""These petitions do not include Bernalillo County or the Native American lands. As a side note, the largest greenhouse gas emitter in the state is on Native American lands.""
\
Gray said it is no secret that the Richardson-Denish administration is against the oil and gas industry.
\
""All one has to do is look at the governor- appointed members, along with the qualifications of the Environmental Improvement Board and the Oil Conservation Commission to see how the boards and commissions are opposed to the oil and gas industry.""
\
Gray, who is familiar with the petroleum refining industry through his years of employment with Navajo Refining in Artesia and surrounding states, said if the petition is successful, it will have a devastating impact on the two refineries in the state.
\
""Their competition in the Texas Panhandle, El Paso and Big Spring, Texas, will have a significant competitive advantage over the New Mexico refineries,"" he said.
\
In his letter to the Environmental Improvement board he further added: ""Business that you cost New Mexico will not benefit the atmosphere because if Giant and Navajo were not in business, it would not diminish the use of petroleum products at all. It would simply be taken up by the Texas refineries, which are protected by their government.""
\
Gray, who serves on the New Mexico House Energy Committee, said the committee has heard similar bills in the past three years concerning greenhouse gases and cap and trade proposals.
\
""All have met with defeat, yet the Environmental Improvement Department continues to push for these types of regulations,"" he said.
\
Gray further said the state has significant financial problems but it is wasting financial resources on the Cap and Trade hearings around the state.
\
Rep. John Heaton, D-Carlsbad
\
Rep. John Heaton, D-Carlsbad, said in this past Legislative session wrote and successfully passed bill that required the Environmental Department to do an economic analysis of the impact of the cap and trade proposal on the economy of New Mexico, taking into account oil and gas production, power generation and potash production. But when the study was completed, it was not what he had envisioned or asked for.
\
""They study they (Environment Department) came back with was really a study based on another study, which is hardly the basis for any primary impact decision,"" Heaton said. ""All assumptions of the study are based on the fact the first study was accurate, which is horrible science and creates a horrible unscientific hypothesis.""
\
Heaton said all of the studies place a significant greenhouse gas emission emphasis on automobiles and energy efficiency.
\
""This was never intended to be a study on these two areas, of which energy efficiency is overstated,"" he said. ""I'm really frustrated, Heaton said. ""I personally resent the fact that the models presented do not present impacts to the industries that were expressly requested in the bill. These industries are responsible for 12 to 22 percent of the state's budget, and how they are impacted is a critical economic decision.""
\
Heaton added that the study he asked for did not include analysis of the increased costs to the oil and gas industry and whether companies would be willing to invest in New Mexico when their profits are significantly diminished by additional overhead caused by cap and trade policies.
\
""It they cannot recover their capital costs within a reasonable period of time it is unlikely they will drill in New Mexico when there are literally thousands of places to drill in this country,"" he said.
\
Heaton said that the cap and trade process proposed by the Environment Department allows New Mexico companies to buy offsets from out-of-state, which means that dollars and the economic base of New Mexico will be potentially transferred to other states.
\
""This is a bad business model,"" he said. ""Cap and trade invites huge political decisions and corruption about what is an offset and what is not. It invites huge political manipulation we all hate. We need a new model that is clear, transparent and uniform and puts money directly into our changing system. We cannot afford to wake up 20 years from now and think that all wind and solar will replace base-load capacity.""

FARMINGTON -- Farmington City Council voted to appeal a decision by state regulators approving a cap-and-trade program, setting the stage for a protracted legal battle that will involve reducing pollution versus protecting economic interests.
\
Councilors voted unanimously at their meeting Tuesday to appeal the state Environmental Improvement Board's decision last month approving a cap-and-trade program aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The decision followed a private meeting during which councilors were expected to discuss legal strategy. The city's policy is to discuss litigation in private.
\
The city isn't only interested in the effects the regulations will have on its utility: The city owns a stake in the coal-fired power plant San Juan Generating Station, Mayor Tommy Roberts said.
\
In addition, ""We have a duty and a responsibility to the people of San Juan County and more specifically to the citizens of Farmington to weigh in on these kinds of regulatory impacts that will have significant consequences to the city of Farmington,"" he said.
\
He explained that regulations could harm San Juan County's economy by causing a ""huge loss of jobs.""
\
The decision to appeal follows approval Monday by the environmental board of a separate plan developed by environmental group New Energy Economy to cap greenhouse gases. The plan calls for coal-fired power plants and refineries to reduce emissions by 3 percent annually from 2010 levels.
\
The cap-and-trade program, formed by the New Mexico Environment Department, calls for 2 percent reductions in emissions by facilities that discharge more than 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases per year.
\
Roberts criticized the regulations, calling them ""symbolic.""
\
""No one asserts that the implementation of these rules will have any significant impact on global warming,"" he said.
\
The environmental board says climate change has led to a declining water supply, snowpack and soil moisture and increased severity and frequency of wildfires.
\
The environment department contends the state won't lose jobs, though job roles may change as New Mexico switches to producing cleaner energy. The program also would spur development of industries that produce clean energy.
\
Under the new regulations, facilities that exceed the cap could buy allowances or offsets as part of a regional trade mechanism. Facilities below the cap could profit by selling their unneeded emission allowances.
\
Free allowances would lessen costs for Farmington's electric utility, according to the environment department. Electric utilities also can reduce emissions by managing energy demand, reducing electricity loss at generating stations, developing carbon capture and storage projects and using renewable energy.
\
The environmental board did not have legal authority to pass greenhouse gas emissions caps, said Tom Outler, an attorney with the Rodey Law Firm in Albuquerque. The city hired the firm to represent it during environmental board hearings and the appeal.
\
Outler explained that because an air quality standard doesn't exist, there cannot be a regulation that attempts to control greenhouse gases.
\
""Since there's no federal or state standard and because the regulations themselves do not attempt to create a standard, the board simply does not have the authority to adopt these regulations,"" Outler said.
\
The city first will file a legal notice with the New Mexico Court of Appeals stating its intent to appeal the regulations, he said. About a month later, it will file another statement that outlines issues and arguments.
\
If additional groups file appeals as expected, the court may combine the appeals, as well as challenges to both greenhouse gas cap programs, he said. Utilities could form one group appealing the decision while the energy industry could comprise another.
\
Litigation could cost the city from $10,000 to $50,000, depending on how many groups join the appeal, he said.
\
The appeals court could take at least a year to rule on the appeal and maybe as many as two years.
\
Meanwhile, attempts by lawmakers and Gov.-elect Susana Martinez to overturn regulations are likely to take place.
\
If those are successful before the appeals court rules, the city could withdraw its appeal, he said.
\
The city's electric utility contends cap and trade will lead to a rate hike of 1 percent annually until 2020 for residential customers and 2 to 2.5 percent for industrial customers.
\
Proponents say cap and trade will reduce greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming in New Mexico and won't lead to an electricity rate hike between now and 2020.
\
The environment department contends that climate change will cost New Mexico households $3,400 annually by 2020, or $3.2 billion, because of increased costs of wild fires, health, energy, lost recreation opportunities and storm and flood damage.

ALBUQUERQUE (AP) -- New Mexico regulators on Tuesday narrowly approved a proposal to establish what state officials call the most comprehensive greenhouse gas pollution reduction regulations in the nation.Supporters of the cap-and-trade program say it's the first step for New Mexico getting a handle on the pollution blamed for global warming, but critics are worried the new regulations will lead to higher electricity costs for consumers and an exodus of businesses and jobs to surrounding states.Public Service Company of New Mexico, the state's largest electric utility, said annual costs to comply with the new regulations are estimated to reach $110 million by 2020. The utility said those costs will have to be passed on to customers.""We remain convinced that comprehensive federal legislation is the only way to meaningfully reduce emissions, minimize costs to customers and to our economy, and not disadvantage any particular state. As a result, we are disappointed by today's decision,"" said PNM Resources chief executive and president Pat Vincent-Collawn.She said the company will continue to evaluate all options, including possible legal action.The New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board spent more than four hours considered a petition by the Environment Department to allow the state to participate in a regional cap-and-trade program with the other Western states and Canadian provinces that make up the Western Climate Initiative.Board members made one change to the proposal before approving it on a 4-3 vote. They included language that would allow the state to propose cost containment measures if the cost of allowances exceed a certain level.The state's program calls for 2 percent reductions to begin in 2012. Facilities that are over the cap would be able to buy and even bank allowances or offsets as part of the regional trade mechanism. Facilities under the cap could profit by selling their unneeded emission allowances.The program will not be implemented unless there are sufficient greenhouse gas allowances to make trading efficient and cost-effective. It also includes a sunset provision if the federal government were to implement its own program.Supporters contend the cap-and-trade program will benefit the economy by encouraging clean energy development.""This regulation sends a clear signal. New Mexico is open for business in the new energy economy,"" said John Fogarty, a Santa Fe physician who is backing a separate emissions cap proposal still pending before the board. ""It will attract new investment to the state and create good high paying jobs in the renewable energy and efficiency industries.""Department officials were elated with the board's decision.""I'm just really pleased with how thoughtful they were in their deliberations and their consideration of the cost to industry and the consumer as well as the urgency of the matter,"" said Sandra Ely, environment and energy policy coordinator with the Environment Department.""Every single board member agreed that climate change is one of most important issues of our time that has to be addressed. What they didn't all agree on was how to address it,"" Ely said.With the board's approval, the program will become effective Jan. 1.Gov. Bill Richardson, who has been pushing for emissions reductions since 2005, called on the federal government after Tuesday's vote to build on New Mexico's program and implement a national cap-and-trade system.The proposal had been the source of much debate among conservationists, electric utilities and other industry representatives, with critics arguing that New Mexico's emissions are only a fraction of the global problem and that handicapping the state's businesses with another regulation could prove economically disastrous.Dozens of experts spent days testifying before the board earlier this year on the potential impacts.New Mexico's coal-fired power plants and the oil and gas industry pump about 24 million metric tons of carbon emissions into the air each year. The state aims to curb the emissions of those that emit 25,000 metric tons or more.

\
SANTA FE -- The New Mexico Environment Department's petition for a new regulation to cap and trade greenhouse gases will be heard this week by the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board.
\
The hearing, which began Monday, is scheduled to continue until Sept. 30 at the old Public Employees Retirement Association building, Apodaca Hall, 1120 Paseo de Peralta in Santa Fe. The hearing, which will begin at 9 a.m. each day, will provide a public comment period from 7 to 8 p.m. each day.
\
Public hearings were held recently in Carlsbad and Artesia, drawing large crowds that included representatives from the potash, oil and gas industries, legislators representing Eddy County, local business and industry representatives and local government leaders. All spoke in opposition to the proposed regulation.
\
Several state and local leaders said they plan to attend the hearings in Santa Fe this week.
\
""New Mexico will not implement the program unless there are sufficient greenhouse gas emissions allowances within the region to make the trading program efficient and cost-effective,"" said New Mexico Environment Department Deputy Secretary Sarah Cottrell in a press release.
\
""Cap and trade makes sense by providing cost effective mechanisms to reduce emissions and giving industry considerable flexibility in deciding how to reduce emissions. New Mexico is vulnerable to higher temperatures, reduced snowpack, more severe droughts and increased forest fires as a result of climate change so it is imperative that we act now to control emissions,"" she said.
\
The proposed regulations will enable the state to participate in a regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program with other Western Climate Initiative jurisdictions. The initiative consists of seven U.S. states and four Canadian provinces working together to address climate change. The proposal is consistent with existing legislative authority to regulate sources of air pollution in the state.
\
Economic data indicates that New Mexico and the surrounding region can reduce emissions with a modest positive impact to the economy. The program would apply to only the largest emitters in the state ? approximately 63 sources including mostly electric generating units and oil and gas facilities would be part of the program. The program is scheduled to start in 2012 and would require sources to reduce emissions 2 percent annually through 2020 or purchase equivalent allowances.
\
The proposed rule includes language that ""sunsets"" the state regulation if the federal government implements an equally effective national cap-and-trade program.
\
The petition can be downloaded at http://www.nmenv.state.nm.us/cc/.

FARMINGTON -- New Mexico's largest electricity provider filed an appeal Tuesday against the state's new cap-and-trade scheme.
\
PNM, based in Albuquerque, said the program approved by the Environmental Improvement Board will impose unnecessary costs and hurt jobs.
\
""We're concerned about the state's cap and trade largely because of economic concern, that it creates a cost for New Mexico that other states do not have,"" PNM spokesman Don Brown said.
\
He said the program could ""result in a loss of jobs."" PNM also questions whether the Environmental Improvement Board has the authority to regulate carbon emissions, Brown said.
\
The cap-and-trade plan stands to affect San Juan Generating Station, a coal-burning power plant of which PNM owns about half.
\
It is not expected to affect Four Corners Power Plant, which sits on Navajo Nation land and outside of state jurisdiction, Brown said.
\
PNM's appeal lands before the New Mexico Court of Appeals. It is not clear when the court will take up the case.
\
The utility's action is separate from the city of Farmington's appeal set in motion last week. Other entities are expected to file notices of appeal as well, said Jay Burnham, city attorney.
\
The Court of Appeals may opt to combine the appeals.
\
Farmington welcomes the allies, Burnham said.
\
""We do think that there's some advantage in a couple of aspects,"" he said. ""One, it shows solidarity on the part of (cap and trade) opponents. Secondly, we can pool our legal and technical resources.""
\
Farmington city councilors voted unanimously Dec. 7 to appeal the state board's decision last month approving a cap-and-trade program aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The city owns a stake in the coal-fired power plant San Juan Generating Station, Mayor Tommy Roberts said.
\
""We have a duty and a responsibility to the people of San Juan County, and more specifically to the citizens of Farmington to weigh in on these kinds of regulatory impacts that will have significant consequences to the city of Farmington,"" Roberts said last week.

The New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) has asked the state Environmental Improvement Board (EIB) to adopt a cap-and-trade system for New Mexico. The proposal is on a fast track: The EIB could approve the proposal as soon as the fall. The ramifications of a greenhouse gas emission reduction regulation would impact the oil and gas industry, the mining industry, the electric generating and transmission industry, the dairy industry and every rural business, large or small in the state outside of the Albuquerque/Bernalillo area. The NMED is asking appointed officials (EIB) to do what state legislators would not do. NMED twice failed to persuade the state legislature to grant EIB the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Just this year, all states participating in the Western Climate Initiative have slowed or completely abandoned plans for state-level carbon regulation with the exception of New Mexico and California. An initiative on the ballot this November in California would delay implementing that state's carbon law until the states unemployment rate drops to a specific level. This would leave New Mexico as the only state to implement such a regulation. We do not yet know the full, potential impact on the state's economy. Though the NMED has said the proposal is economically, we DO know that New Mexico energy costs will increase. Under the proposal the state's electric utilities would be forced to reduce production from exiting fossil fuel-fired power plants or pay a price for reductions achieved by other sources of greenhouse gases. Either way, the price of electricity would rise by an unknown amount. The state's oil and gas production industry, a leading employer and major source of funding for state government, would face a similar choice and similarly unknown costs. These added costs would be unique to New Mexico, creating an economic disadvantage for job growth. These costs would not exist in neighboring states providing a powerful incentive for existing businesses to limit growth or leave the sate.
\
We requested that the Environmental Improvement Board conduct a meeting in Hobbs in order that the citizens of southeast New Mexico would have the opportunity to express their concerns to the committee. Regrettably, they refused to travel to our area due to the cost of travel. The EIB will take public comment on the new energy Economy and New Mexico Environment Department's Greenhouse Gas proposed rules for the record on Wednesday, September 1, between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. at the Lea County Event Center. A hearing officer will take comments on both proposals and will bring a court reporter so that the full board does not have to travel, but can read the transcripts.
\
It is time for citizens across the state to express their concerns regarding the proposed regulations that would set us apart from every other state in the union and threaten the New Mexico economy at a time when revenues are continuing to drop. We strongly encourage you to come to the Lea County Event Center on Wednesday, Sept. 1 and let your voice be heard.
\
(Editor's note: The New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board will also hold public hearings Tuesday, Aug. 31, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. in Artesia at the Artesia Center, 612 N. Eighth St., and from 4 to 8 p.m. in Carlsbad at the Pecos River Carousel House, 711 Muscatel St.)

CARLSBAD -- A bill introduced this week by Sens. Carroll Leavell, R-Eddy and Lea, and David Ulibarri, D-Grants, to repeal cap and trade rules adopted by the Environmental Improvement Board in the final weeks of the previous administration is receiving strong bipartisan support, Leavell said.
\
Leavell said Senate Bill 190 will improve the business climate by repealing the damaging environmental rules over greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The cap and trade program Leavell and others are working to repeal sets a limit on carbon dioxide emissions and allows those who exceed the limit to buy credits from those who have credits to spare.
\
The legislation introduced by Leavell and Ulibarri would repeal four adopted rules. The bill would repeal the rules that place a cap on emissions of greenhouse gases; would repeal requirements for reporting and verifying greenhouse gas emissions for a cap and trade program; and it would repeal the rule that adopted a cap and trade program for the state.
\
The bill also has an emergency clause that would make the legislation effective immediately after it is signed into law.
\
A delegation from Carlsbad this week met with Economic Development Department Secretary Jon Barela and Raj Solomon, New Mexico Environment Department deputy secretary, and urged them to support the repeal of the cap and trade rules.
\
John Waters, Carlsbad Department of Development executive director, and Jack Volpato, Eddy County Commissioner, told the cabinet officials that the cap and trade rules will do nothing to protect the environment, but will cripple businesses in all of rural New Mexico through increased power and operation expenses.
\
They asked Leavell and Sen. Vernon Asbill, R-Eddy and Otero, during their meeting with them in the senate offices, to stay strong in their efforts to repeal the cap and trade rules. Gov. Susana Martinez -- during her meeting with the Carlsbad delegation dubbed the ""Bat Brigade"" -- said she does not support the cap and trade rules.
\
Leavell said the rules are a critical issue and deserve immediate attention from the State Senate.
\
Although the cap and trade rules impact the oil and gas industry -- one of the largest employers in the southeastern and northwestern parts of the state -- the rules affect more than just one industry. Other extractive industries such as potash in Eddy County, and coal and copper mining industries in the northwest of the state are also impacted.
\
""The rules need to be repealed immediately to avoid further layoffs in the oil and gas industry and the electric generation industries, as well as the mining industry,"" Leavell said.
\
Leavell said the reckless rules could create an even bigger crisis for the state.
\
""The Environmental Improvement Board rules have put onerous demands on these industries that have been so good for our state. We have to help stop these industries from fleeing from our state because of the EIB rules,"" he said. ""We need to help improve our employment situation by keeping these good employers in our state and by encouraging those who have left to return.""
\
Leavell said some of his fellow senators are anxious about the hearing over the repeal of the cap and trade rules in the House.
\
""I believe the chairmen and members of the committees that will be hearing this bill understand the critical need that it pass for the sake of New Mexico's economy, business and for the sake of many or our unemployed who could have hope in finding a job if the oil and gas industry is revived,"" Leavell said.
\
After the bill was introduced, it was assigned to hearings in the Senate Conservation and Senate Finance Committee for debate and passage before it is heard on the senate floor.

ALBUQUERQUE (AP) -- New Mexico regulators are set to decide Tuesday whether to adopt a state proposal that would establish a cap-and-trade program to control greenhouse gas emissions.The New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board is considering a petition by the Environment Department that would allow the state to participate in a regional cap-and-trade program with other Western states and Canadian provinces that make up the Western Climate Initiative.Under the state's plan, the program would not be implemented unless there were sufficient greenhouse gas allowances to make trading efficient and cost-effective. It also includes a sunset provision if the federal government were to implement its own program.State officials said the cap-and-trade program would be a first step toward getting a handle on New Mexico's emissions.New Mexico's coal-fired power plants and the oil and gas industry pump about 24 million metric tons of carbon emissions into the air each year. The state aims to curb the emissions of those that emit 25,000 metric tons or more.The proposal calls for 2 percent reductions to begin in 2012. Facilities that are over the cap would be able to buy and even bank allowances or offsets as part of the trade mechanism. Facilities under the cap could profit by selling their unneeded emission allowances.About five dozen facilities would fall under the rule, but that number could grow, as the Environment Department says it would eventually look to expand the scope of sources and emissions to account for industrial, commercial and residential buildings as well as transportation fuels.Jim Norton, director of the department's Environmental Protection Division, said New Mexico has a chance to be a leader when it comes to adopting climate regulations. With global warming, he said the state could face more drought, reduced snowpack and more intense wildfires.Critics argue that New Mexico's emissions are only a fraction of the global problem and that handicapping the state's businesses with another regulation could prove economically disastrous.Public Service Company of New Mexico, the state's largest electric utility, and Colorado-based Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association Inc., which provides power to rural co-ops, have said there will be costs to comply with the proposed regulations and those costs will have to be passed on to customers.Lawyers and experts on both sides spent days testifying before the board earlier this year, and dozens of people turned out for public comment sessions.Board members have been reviewing testimony and other documents related to the case to prepare for the deliberations.

FARMINGTON -- A cap-and-trade plan approved by New Mexico regulators could mean a rate hike for residential and commercial customers of the Farmington Electric Utility System.
\
Electricity rates could increase 1 percent annually until 2020 for residential customers and 2 to 2.5 percent for industrial customers, said Mike Sims, generation manager for the electric utility. The average residential customer pays $70 each month for electricity.
\
""It's going to definitely increase our costs,"" Sims said.
\
The potential rate hike follows approval earlier this month by the state Environmental Improvement Board of the cap-and-trade program aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming. Beginning in 2012, the program calls for 2 percent reductions in emissions by facilities that discharge more than 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases per year.
\
The regulations' effect on the utility ""is something that we need to be thinking about and considering,"" Mayor Tommy Roberts said.
\
""I think ultimately any costs of compliance that are placed on the electric utility are going to be borne by the consumer,"" he said. ""I think there certainly would be deliberations by the administration at the electric utility and City Council about how to mitigate those cost increases that might arise as a result of compliance with the regulations.""
\
Farmington electric utility administrators such as Sims have testified against the proposed plans at recent environmental board hearings.
\
Regulations would require the utility to reduce output at its natural gas power plants, Sims said. The utility already buys power from out of state and the regulations would lead it to purchase additional power from coal-fired facilities because it's less expensive.
\
""We already burn clean natural gas in our power plants,"" he said. ""If we go out on the open market and buy power from Arizona or Colorado or somewhere else, that's probably going to come from coal. It's having the exact opposite effect of reducing greenhouse gas: It's actually making more greenhouse gas.""
\
The utility already buys wind power, but buying additional power generated by that kind of renewable energy will cost more money than buying from coal-fired facilities outside the state. The utility also would spend more to install solar power.
\
Though there's no fuel costs associated with using solar power, the only viable form of alternative energy in San Juan County, the utility still would need traditional fossil fuels as a supplement when the sun isn't shining, he said.
\
The city has tried to seek federal and state money to install solar power, ""but we have just been totally ignored by both the state and the federal government,"" Sims said.
\
The cap-and-trade plan puts New Mexico at a ""competitive disadvantage"" compared with other states, Sims said.
\
The higher cost of electricity could send industrial customers such as natural gas processing facilities out of state where electricity costs less, Sims said.
\
Under the new regulations, facilities that exceed the cap could buy allowances or offsets as part of a regional trade mechanism. Facilities below the cap could profit by selling their unneeded emission allowances.
\
The plan could face challenges.
\
Gov.-elect Susana Martinez's administration is determining the most effective way to reverse the cap-and-trade plan, Martinez spokesman Danny Diaz said in a prepared e-mail statement.
\
""Governor-elect Martinez has been very clear that she opposes cap and trade as it would impose a new energy tax on New Mexico's families and small businesses,"" he said in the statement. ""A cap-and-trade program would make the state less competitive and negatively impact job growth.""
\
House Minority Leader Tom Taylor, R-Farmington, who opposes the cap-and-trade plan, called it ""nothing but a process to make fossil fuels more expensive so that they're more competitive with alternative fuels.""
\
""We're prepared to introduce legislation if necessary,"" he said.
\
City Manager Rob Mayes called Farmington's 45,000 utility customers ""potential victims"" of the plan at a July meeting on the regulations.
\
The regulations would spill over into all sectors of the local economy causing a ""death spiral,"" where energy costs rise, jobs are cut and residents leave the area, he said.
\
New Mexico Environment Department Officials did not return phone messages seeking comment.

CARLSBAD -- An Eddy County lawmaker says some members of the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board involved in the proposed cap and trade regulation may have a conflict of interest and should be recused from making any decisions relating to the issue.
\
Rep. Bill Gray, R-Eddy and Otero, has sent a letter to Attorney General Gary King asking him to intervene and ""pursue all available remedies necessary"" to force the recusal of all board members who have, or appear to have, conflicts of interest with respect to the cap and trade proposals.
\
""New Mexico law and the Environment Department's own regulations protect the integrity of the proceedings such as these by requiring all members that may reasonably appear to have a conflict of interest to recuse themselves from any proceeding where such an appearance of conflict exists,"" Gray states in his letter. ""Contrary to this well-settled law, the board presiding over these proposals is replete with members who either have conflicts of interest or who appear to have conflicts of interest.""
\
Gray further adds that instead of being comprised of persons who can fairly and impartially preside over hearings and decide whether to implement either proposal, the board is stacked with members who have pre-judged issues, are paid lobbyists or are officers or directors of parties to the proceedings -- all situations that at a minimum, create the appearance of conflict of interest.
\
The state Environment Department last week held hearings in Carlsbad and Artesia to gather comments from community and business leaders - who all spoke out against the proposals.
\
In his letter to King, Gray said the members of the board are poised to pass judgment on the cap and trade proposals in a few short months, and with the stakes so high, residents of New Mexico should be entitled to some assurances that the board ""carefully and thoughtfully"" considered the evidence presented to them in reaching a decision on the proposals.
\
Gray told King that the vast majority of the people believe the board is not fairly considering the evidence presented in on-going proceedings and that the board members have pre-determined the outcomes of both proposals.
\
""The various board members' glaring conflicts of interest reinforce these beliefs and serve only to undermine the perceived legitimacy of our government and its officials,"" Gray concluded.

FARMINGTON -- City Council will meet privately Tuesday to discuss a cap-and-trade plan approved recently by state regulators to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Councilors are scheduled to discuss ""threatened and pending litigation,"" according to the city of Farmington, related to the state Environmental Improvement Board's decision to adopt the program aimed at reducing emissions blamed for global warming.
\
The city's policy is to discuss litigation behind closed doors.
\
The meeting is held so councilors can decide whether the city should appeal or seek a review of the board's decision, City Attorney Jay Burnham said.
\
""Some of the discussion could include a legal challenge,"" he said. ""It's just legal options that are available to the city and other opponents of the rule at this point.""
\
Attorneys representing opponents of cap and trade are discussing how to challenge the board's decision, Burnham added.
\
Governor-elect Susana Martinez's administration also is determining the most effective way to reverse the cap-and-trade plan.
\
The city's electric utility contends the cap-and-trade program could mean a rate hike for its residential and commercial customers.
\
Electricity rates could increase 1 percent annually until 2020 for residential customers and 2 to 2.5 percent for industrial customers, said Mike Sims, generation manager for the electric utility.
\
An economic analysis showed no increase in electricity prices between now and 2020, said Sandra Ely, the New Mexico Environment Department's energy and policy coordinator.
\
Councilman Jason Sandel said last week that the city should participate in a legal challenge to fight cap and trade.
\
""I believe it's something that's going to be happening quickly, and something that the city of Farmington needs to be a leader on rather than a follower,"" Sandel said.
\
This won't be the first time councilors have considered entering the foray on legal challenges of proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Councilors decided earlier this year not to join as a plaintiff a lawsuit against the state's environmental board. Instead, city officials fought the greenhouse gas emissions cap by testifying against it at environmental board hearings.
\
Despite the testimony, earlier this month the board approved a program that calls for 2-percent reductions in emissions through 2020 by facilities that discharge more than 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases per year.

As business owners in the Las Cruces area, we're constantly looking for ways to help expand the region's business climate. There are many good reasons for doing so, but two principal reasons come to mind.
\
One, it creates jobs. Two, more jobs mean more people which means more customers for our businesses. It's quite simple. But the real key is not to create jobs for the sake of creating jobs, but to create good paying, long-term jobs that people can still be doing two or three generations from now, and beyond.
\
One way to expand the region's business climate and attract those kinds of jobs is through diversification of the local economy. In other words, in addition to existing industries and businesses, you want to attract new types of businesses that currently may not be here.
\
That is just one reason why we support the proposal before the New Mexico Department of Environment to cap and reduce the state's greenhouse gas emissions. Doing so, we firmly believe, will stimulate New Mexico's economy, particularly in the more rural areas such as Las Cruces. And the facts support this belief.
\
Putting a restriction on carbon, as modest as this proposal is, will send a strong signal to the clean tech world that New Mexico is open for business to the billions that are waiting to be invested. And believe us, the investors are out there.
\
In 2008, a year after the state of California passed carbon regulations, venture capital investment in clean energy technologies reached an all-time high of $3.3 billion, capturing 57 percent of the national total. Today, while the rest of California's economy is suffering, its solar business has exploded. It's worth noting that New Mexico has the second most solar potential of any state in the nation, behind California.
\
It isn't just solar that New Mexico has, however. The state has good geothermal in key locations, along with significant wind resources. And here's the beauty of it - these are resources that can be exploited in the more rural areas of New Mexico, where the resources are located and it's more advantageous to develop. No one will propose putting a wind farm in downtown Santa Fe.
\
There have been a lot of misinformation, and in some cases, outright lies perpetuated regarding the proposed emissions cap. If you were to believe the naysayers, one would think that the state of New Mexico will simply close its doors, all industries will leave, and everyone will be forced to live in unheated caves.
\
In actuality, none of this has an ounce of truth. The oil and gas industry didn't leave Colorado when it enacted tougher regulations. In fact the state is leading the interior west in oil and gas production. At the same time, its renewable energy economy has exploded with 17,000 new jobs in the last five years. The lobbying against the greenhouse emissions cap has been funded by outside big money interests.
\
Your cow or your truck or the air you breathe are not going to get taxed. The only industries that will be affected by the rule, are big stationary sources like coal power plants or refineries that emit over 25,000 tons of CO2 per year. The required reduction is only 3 percent per year, until 2020 when the law sunsets. In other words, the total reduction will be 25 percent. Most experts agree that both the oil and gas and power industries can produce a major share of that reduction through simple efficiency measures, which will in the end, save consumers money.
\
As a builder whose business is highly dependent on a vibrant and growing economy, this doesn't sound too bad. It doesn't really matter whether you agree with the greenhouse gas scenario. What does matter is we reduce emissions, we make the fossil fuels industries more efficient, we save businesses and consumers money, and we stimulate the economy with an influx of clean energy investments. In fact, it sounds like a win-win for everybody.

CARLSBAD -- Legislators representing Eddy County, local government officials and industry and business leaders have come out in opposition to a cap and trade petition proposed by the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board.
\
The Eddy County Commission in recent months passed two resolutions opposing the petition and, along with a letter, submitted them to the NMED Board. In addition, a representative for the county testified at a recent hearing on the impact it would have in Eddy County if the petition were to be implemented.
\
On Tuesday, the Carlsbad City Council also came out in opposition, voting to submit a letter to the NMED.
\
Russell Hardy, representing the Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce, in his letter to the editor published Friday in the Current-Argus, explained the petition.
\
""The petition, as currently written, would apply only to rural businesses and industries that produce more than 250,000 tons of CO2 annually and would exempt businesses operating in Albuquerque, Santa Fe and on sovereign Indian Nations,"" he explained.
\
""Businesses and industries in our area that would be impacted would include potash mines, Navajo refineries in Artesia and Lovington, Excel Energy generating stations in Lea County, not to mention large-scale manufacturing, mining and utility businesses throughout the rural regions of the state.""
\
Eddy County Commissioner Lewis Derrick, a rancher in north Eddy County, said the Environment Department's petition will hurt the local economy and will have a far-reaching effect if it passes.
\
""I'm looking at this from the possibility of this petition wrecking our tax base and running off businesses,"" Derrick said. ""It's going to impact not only the oil and gas industry. It will impact farmers, ranchers and the trucking industry. The state should stay out of our business. They need to back off this. It's mind boggling that they would do this to the people of New Mexico.""
\
County Manager Allen Sartin said the wind blows across the border from Arizona and other bordering states, and along with it comes pollutants in the air. He said in order to truly minimize greenhouse gases, similar action would need to be implemented by every state or by federal action for all states to comply.
\
Rep. Bill Gray, R-Eddy and Otero Counties, sent a letter to the Environmental Improvement Board chastising it for its proposed petition.
\
""This is another prime example of why New Mexico is considered an anti-business state,"" he wrote. ""These petitions do not include Bernalillo County or the Native American lands. As a side note, the largest greenhouse gas emitter in the state is on Native American lands.""
\
Gray said it is no secret that the Richardson-Denish administration is against the oil and gas industry.
\
""All one has to do is look at the governor- appointed members, along with the qualifications of the Environmental Improvement Board and the Oil Conservation Commission to see how the boards and commissions are opposed to the oil and gas industry.""
\
Gray, who is familiar with the petroleum refining industry through his years of employment with Navajo Refining in Artesia and surrounding states, said if the petition is successful, it will have a devastating impact on the two refineries in the state.
\
""Their competition in the Texas Panhandle, El Paso and Big Spring, Texas, will have a significant competitive advantage over the New Mexico refineries,"" he said.
\
In his letter to the Environmental Improvement board he further added: ""Business that you cost New Mexico will not benefit the atmosphere because if Giant and Navajo were not in business, it would not diminish the use of petroleum products at all. It would simply be taken up by the Texas refineries, which are protected by their government.""
\
Gray, who serves on the New Mexico House Energy Committee, said the committee has heard similar bills in the past three years concerning greenhouse gases and cap and trade proposals.
\
""All have met with defeat, yet the Environmental Improvement Department continues to push for these types of regulations,"" he said.
\
Gray further said the state has significant financial problems but it is wasting financial resources on the Cap and Trade hearings around the state.

FARMINGTON -- City councilors are scheduled to decide Tuesday whether to appeal a decision by state regulators approving a plan aimed at reducing greenhouse gases.
\
Councilors will decide publicly whether to authorize the city to file an appeal of the state Environmental Improvement Board's decision with the New Mexico Court of Appeals following a private meeting on the matter, Mayor Tommy Roberts said.
\
""The purpose of the closed session is to receive additional advice from counsel,"" Roberts said. ""Essentially, it's a follow-up by our outside counsel to questions regarding strategy that were asked during the first closed session.""
\
City councilors met privately with attorneys last month to discuss ""threatened and pending litigation"" related to the environmental board's decision to approve a cap-and-trade program.
\
The city hired an attorney with the Rodey Law Firm to represent it during environmental board hearings, and city officials had planned to meet with that attorney during last month's closed meeting.
\
The city's Farmington Electric Utility System, which testified against cap and trade during the hearings, contends the plan could mean a rate hike for residential and commercial customers.
\
Proponents say cap and trade will reduce greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming in New Mexico and won't lead to an electricity rate hike between now and 2020.
\
From 2012 to 2020, the program calls for 2 percent reductions in emissions by facilities that discharge more than 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases per year.
\
The plan could lead electricity rates to increase 1 percent annually until 2020 for residential customers and 2 to 2.5 percent for industrial customers, said Mike Sims, generation manager for the city's electric utility.
\
The environment department contends that climate change will cost New Mexico households $3,400 annually by 2020, or $3.2 billion, because of increased costs of wild fires, health, energy, lost recreation opportunities and storm and flood damage.

CARLSBAD -- ""It's not over until the Legislative session is over.""
\
Those were the fighting words of Sen. Carroll Leavell, R-Jal, after a bill he co-sponsored to repeal cap and trade rules was tabled in committee on Tuesday.
\
""I lost it in the Judiciary Committee with a vote of 7-4. It went down straight by party line vote,"" Leavell said. ""I guess the Democrat committee members like the Environmental Improvement Board rules. We can resuscitate it by having a majority on the Senate floor. But we need 42 votes to move it out of the Judiciary Committee. I just hope it doesn't get reassigned to that committee. There are other two options for committee reassignment of the bill. It could be sent to the Senate Conservation Committee or the Senate Corporation Committee.""
\
Leavell and Sen. David Ulibarri. D-Grants, sponsored Senate Bill 190 that calls for the repeal of cap and trade rules adopted by the State Environmental Improvement Board in the final weeks of the previous administration.
\
Leavell said SB 190 will improve the business climate by repealing the damaging environmental rules over greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The cap and trade rule sets a limit on carbon dioxide emission and allows those who exceed the limit to buy credits from those who have credits to spare.
\
SB190 would repeal four adopted rules. The bill would repeal the rules that place a cap on emissions of greenhouse gases; would repeal requirements for reporting and verifying greenhouse gas emissions for a cap and trade program; and it would repeal the rule that adopted a cap and trade program for the state.
\
The bill also has an emergency clause that would make the legislation effective immediately after it is signed into law.
\
Rep. Bill Gray, R-Artesia, a strong opponent of cap and trade, said he has been told there is a bill similar to SB190 that is going to be introduced in the senate.
\
""The key to SB 190 - and the other bill - is to keep it out of the Judiciary Committee. I know there will be a strong push to keep it out of there,"" he said, adding that lobbyists from the oil and gas industry around the state are making their presence known. They are lobbying hard to get the cap and trade rules repealed.
\
Gray said should the Leavell bill or a similar bill pass in the senate, it will move to the House.
\
""It will go to the House Energy Committee,"" Gray explained. ""If it gets there, it's going to be still tough. There are 12 members on the committee - six Republicans and six Democrats. To get it through they will have to convince the other side of the aisle to go along with it.""
\
Gray said if legislation fails, plan B is for the new Environment Improvement Board to undo what the previous board did.
\
""When Gov, Martinez picked members for the EIB board, she quizzed them on their position on cap and trade. She is against it, so it would probably be repealed. But it would take longer, It would be much quicker getting it done legislatively,"" Gray said.

19," CAMPAIGN ISSUES 2004\ This is another in a series of stories examining the positions of President Bush and Democratic presidential nominee John F. Kerry on major election issues in the nation and the West.\ Distinctions between President Bush and Sen. John Kerry on environmental issues aren't hard to find.\ The Republican president and the Democratic presidential nominee disagree on how to reduce air pollution, manage public lands, tackle climate change and regulate industries that pollute.\ Bush generally favors less government regulation and more voluntary approaches to clean air, endangered species protection and other challenges.\ The president, a former oilman, has sided with industry on issues, such as power plant emissions, and has hired timber, energy, mining and other industry veterans for senior positions in his administration. His Interior secretary, Gale Norton, began her career as a lawyer for the conservative-minded Mountain States Legal Foundation.\ The differences even seemed to be reflected by the towns they chose for campaign appearances in New Mexico last week. The president went to Hobbs, in the heart of New Mexico's oil patch. Kerry visited Santa Fe, where being called an environmentalist is as hip as a soy latte.\ While critics say his record paints a different picture, Bush sometimes sounds downright green.\ ""My administration has put in place some of the most important anti-pollution policies in a decade,"" Bush said in an Earth Day speech in Wells, Maine. ""Since 2001, the condition of America's air, land and water has improved.""\ But Bush has been accused by environmentalists of reversing decades of environmental protection, and he received an F from the League of Conservation Voters, the first failing grade the group has ever given a president. The league also gave him an F for the impact of his policies in New Mexico.\ Bush's agency leaders often frame environmental policy decisions in terms of the need for balance with economic interests. In the second presidential debate this fall, Bush said he has ""a good, common-sense policy"" on the environment and called himself ""a good steward of the land.""\ His approach pleases at least some business interests. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce polled its members and found 79 percent of those responding supported Bush and 77 percent said he would be better for their business. The National Federation of Independent Business surveyed 11,000 members and found 95 percent want to rehire Bush for president.\ ""The Business Roundtable believes that voluntary innovations developed in the private sector can be the driving force for environmental progress,"" said Tita Thompson Freeman, communications director for the association of large U.S. corporations. ""We feel that our environment is best protected when our economy is strong and likewise that protecting the environment makes good economic sense.""\ The environment has been a big issue for Kerry throughout his political career.\ He has been a leading opponent of drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, on the forefront of acid rain legislation and has fought for tough air pollution controls and marine and public lands protection. He advocates tougher government regulation than Bush does.\ ""We can continue to strengthen our national security if we also invest in our capacity to safeguard our environment and make America independent of Mideast oil,"" Kerry said last week in Santa Fe.\ ""Above all, in this part of the country, because of its great heritage, because of the Native American history and presence, above all, you understand that what's good for the Earth is good for the people, good for our economy, good for a safer and stronger America.""\ Kerry has a lifetime score of 92 out of 100 from the League of Conservation Voters, which calls him ""an environmental champion."" He has been endorsed by a number of environmental groups, including the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth Action and Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund.\ Kerry has a ""long record of excellence in the Senate,"" said Betsy Loyless, LCV vice president of policy. He would fund environmental programs and choose Cabinet secretaries who understand their job is to advocate for resource protection as well as manage resource use, she said.\ Kerry also has some business support; he has been endorsed by 200 top business leaders, including the heads of Bank of America Corp., Costco Wholesale, Gateway Inc. and Anheuser-Busch.\ Here are Bush and Kerry's stands on several environmental issues:\ Water and drought\ Bush's primary tool for fighting the water resource crises in the West, stemming from drought and rapid growth, is Water 2025. The program aims to head off water conflicts with the help of federal dollars, technical assistance and research.\ Assistant Interior Secretary Bennett Raley has said the plan was developed specifically with New Mexico in mind.\ The Middle Rio Grande in New Mexico, where battles have erupted over scarce water for farmers, cities and the endangered silvery minnow, is one of the Interior Department's water crisis ""hot spots.""\ The president's proposed fiscal year 2005 budget includes $21 million for Water 2025 programs across the West.\ Critics say it's a drop in the bucket. For example, New Mexico alone has more than $2 billion in water project needs, according to state water officials. But Raley has said the program's focus is encouraging new technologies and collaboration rather than handing out money.\ Kerry would ""work with state and local authorities to encourage eff\ icient water use in industrial, urban and farming operations through the use of incentives; ... and the encouragement of modern water management practices such as water transfers, where appropriate,"" according to his platform.\ Wetlands\ In an April 22 Earth Day speech, Bush announced a new goal to restore 3 million acres of wetlands over the next five years through expanded incentive and partnership measures.\ ""Good conservation and good stewardship will happen when people say, 'I'm not going to just rely on the government to be the solution to the problem,' '' Bush said. ""Government can help but not stand in the way.""\ But the Bush administration meanwhile has undercut protection for some wetlands, which provide important wildlife habitat and act as natural filtering systems to remove contaminants from water.\ In response to a Supreme Court decision, the administration changed federal rules so that developers and others don't need Clean Water Act permits if their projects are going to pollute or dry up certain geographically ""isolated"" wetlands.\ The administration argued it did what the court decision required; opponents have said the government took the ruling too far.\ The move -- praised in New Mexico by ranching and oil and gas in\ dustry groups but opposed by state environment and wildlife agencies -- is already coming into play in places like the Sacramento Mountains and the plains of eastern New Mexico.\ It could ultimately affect 20 million acres across the country, including 20 percent of New Mexico's water bodies.\ Kerry proposes a ""Restore America's Waters"" campaign that would tackle pollution and fight in the courts and in Congress to give wetlands more protection.\ He would renew protection for the so-called isolated wetlands now exempted from Clean Water Act protection by the Bush administration, said Carol Browner, an adviser to Kerry and former Environmental Protection Agency chief under President Clinton.\ Superfund\ In December, work on the Fruit Avenue Plume Superfund site in Downtown Albuquerque was halted temporarily because the project ran out of money.\ This summer, the EPA announced it didn't have enough money for half the Superfund sites in the country that were ready to begin cleanup -- including one on Railroad Avenue in Espanola.\ The program used to be funded by a tax on industry. In 1995, the year the taxing authority expired, taxpayers contributed 18 percent of the Superfund program cost. In the 2004 fiscal year, the entire Superfund appropriation of $1.2 billion came from general tax revenue.\ Kerry co-sponsored a bill that would reauthorize the Superfund tax and has vowed to enact it if elected to hold polluters accountable.\ In addition to criticizing Bush's opposition to a tax on industry, Kerry faults the president for a slowdown in how quickly sites are cleaned up since Bush took office.\ ""They're cleaning them at half the rate that we were cleaning them under Bill Clinton.\ ""Why?"" Kerry asked on\ Earth Day in Houston. ""You'd think if we were being responsible, we'd be speeding up the rate at which we're doing this.""\ Bush wants polluters to pay to clean up their own Superfund sites, but opposes a broad tax on industry to pay for orphan sites where the responsible party can't be found or is no longer in business.\ He has asked Congress for $1.4 billion for the program for the coming year, a 10 percent increase.\ The administration has also argued that smaller contaminated sites are now covered by the federal ""brownfields"" program, which works to revitalize industrial and commercial sites with real or perceived contamination.\ Bush signed legislation, co-sponsored by Kerry, that has sped cleanup of brownfields sites.\ Climate change\ The Bush administration's approach to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions aims to use the power of markets, new technology, increased research funding and voluntary reductions by industry.\ Bush in 2002 set a national goal of reducing greenhouse gas intensity -- a measure of emissions relative to U.S. economic activity -- by 18 percent by 2012, arguing it would prevent more than 500 million metric tons of emissions.\ ""Our approach focuses on reducing emissions while sustaining the economic growth needed to finance investment in new, clean energy technologies,"" Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham wrote in Science magazine.\ But Bush's goal of reducing greenhouse gas intensity allows total emissions to increase as the economy grows.\ Kerry, who served in the congressional delegation to the 1997 Kyoto and 2000 Hague climate talks, has criticized Bush for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to reduce global warming gases. Bush has said the Kyoto Protocol would lead t\ o job losses.\ However, Kerry was one of 95 senators to vote against the Kyoto Protocol as long as developing nations like China and India were exempted. In 2001, he introduced legislation to ""speed national action to address global climate change"" and successfully amended the Bush budget to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\ ""The fact is that the Kyoto treaty was flawed,"" Kerry said in the Oct. 8 presidential debate. ""I was in Kyoto, and I was part of that. I know what happened. But this president didn't try to fix it. He just declared it dead, ladies and gentlemen, and we walked away from the work of 160 nations over 10 years.""\ Kerry's platform calls for the United States to ""join the international community and begin to constrain emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.""\ Kerry supports a cap-and-trade system to limit total greenhouse gas emissions, Browner said.\ Endangered Species Act\ Under Bush, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has dramatically slowed listing of new species while focusing its resources on cooperative projects for species protection with private land owners.\ Those programs include grants to ranchers in eastern New Mexico to protect habitat for lesser prairie chickens and sand dune lizards -- in hopes of keeping the animals off the endangered list.\ The administration has endorsed military exemptions from the Endangered Species Act for national security reasons and allowed the EPA to approve pesticides for use without consulting with federal wildlife agencies to see whether they harm endangered species.\ In response to questions from the science journal Nature, Bush said the act needs to be modernized with reforms such as voluntary agreements with landowners and partnerships with states, tribes and other groups.\ ""These programs could provide far greater conservation benefits while avoiding unnecessary regulatory, economic and social burdens,"" he wrot\ e.\ Kerry told Nature he supports the goals of the act and would implement it in a ""cooperative manner that extends the benefits of wildlife and habitat protection to public and private lands.""\ Browner said he would increase endangered species funding.\ ""There's nothing wrong with cooperative programs with private landowners, but at the end the day you need to make sure there are mechanisms in place that will guarantee progress,"" she said.\ Social studies\ A variety of issues will help determine the next president B8"

Cap-and-trade
\
proposal out
\
The New Mexico Environment Department has released a draft rule that would put a cap-and-trade emissions program into play in the state.
\
Department officials seek public comment on the proposed plan, which would go into effect only if sufficient amounts of greenhouse gases are emitted within a seven-state, Western region.
\
A cap-and-trade program aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on a regional basis by capping the amounts permissible to producers, such as coal-fired power plants, while creating ""allowances"" that can be traded or banked by individual polluters.
\
The draft rule can be found at www.nmenv.state.nm.us/cc. A public meeting is set for Tuesday (May 25) at Santa Fe Community College, from 4 to 6 p.m.

21," Rules: Industries must note new set of emissions\ All power plants, oil and gas refineries and concrete plants must begin reporting their greenhouse-gas emissions next year under a new regulation approved by the state Environmental Improvement Board.\ Industries such as smaller asphalt plants and other companies with state air-quality permits will also have to start reporting greenhouse-gas emissions in 2010.\ The reporting rule is a key step in tracking and eventually reducing gases produced in New Mexico that contribute to global warming, officials say.\ Most of those industries already must report emissions of dust particulates, nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide. The new rule adds reporting requirements for carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride.\ Greenhouse-gas emissions are linked by many scientists to rising global temperatures. In New Mexico, coal-fired power plants are the largest source of greenhouse-gas emissions followed by oil and gas operations and transportation, according to the state Environment Department.\ Gov. Bill Richardson set targets that call for reducing emissions to year-2000 levels by 2012, 10 percent below 2000 levels by 2020 and 75 percent below 2000 levels by 2050.\ The governor also formed a task force to study methods for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. Among the top recommendations by the group is to encourage industry reductions through market-based incentives such as a cap-and-trade system, which allows less- polluting industries to sell reduced-emissions credits to higher- polluting companies.\ Public Service Company of New Mexico, the state's largest utility company, was among industries represented on the Climate Change Advisory Group. ""We support the new rules,"" said Susan Sponar, PNM spokeswoman. ""We also advocate a national approach to controlling emissions through a cap-and-trade program.""\ Sponar said PNM was already reporting greenhouse-gas emissions to the federal Environmental Protection Agency. ""Reporting the emissions is really the easiest thing we'll have to do in regards to climate change.""\ Creating a cap-and-trade system starts with a database indicating how much greenhouse gas the state is producing. ""Greenhouse-gas emissions reporting is an essential tool in tracking whether emissions are reduced,"" New Mexico Environment Department Secretary Ron Curry said.\ The new regulations encourage companies to register emissions with The Climate Registry, a multistate greenhouse-gas tracking system, of which New Mexico was a founding member in March. The Climate Registry includes 39 U.S. states, three tribes, the District of Columbia, the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Manitoba and the Mexican state of Sonora.\ ""The goal is to have a uniform standard for reporting greenhouse- gas emissions,"" Environment Department spokeswoman Marissa Stone said.\ Contact Staci Matlock at 470-9843 or smatlock@sfnewmexican.com."

23," Group agrees to reduce emissions 15 percent by 2020\ Curb: Meeting drew diverse group\ New Mexico and its fellow members of the Western Climate Initiative have set a goal for reducing greenhouse gases blamed in part for the steady warming of the planet.\ The trick now is figuring out how to reach an ambitious goal in the next 13 years without causing energy prices to climb higher, hurting both businesses and consumers, according to officials.\ Gov. Bill Richardson's climate initiative team held a public meeting Thursday in Santa Fe to give an update on the greenhouse gas reduction goals and what will happen next.\ Across the West, climate change is targeted by scientists as the cause of increasing temperatures and less snowpack, leading to increased problems with strained water supplies, flooding and drought.\ Richardson and the governors of California, Arizona, Utah, Oregon and Washington and the leaders of Canadian provinces British Columbia and Manitoba formed the initiative this year.\ The group intends a regional approach to reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Other states, including Sonora, Mexico, are showing interest in the group.\ The group has agreed to reduce gross greenhouse gas emissions 15 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. By next August, the group has to figure\ out how to meet the goal. The emissions limit will include carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, hydroflurocarbons and others included in the Kyoto Treaty, according to Sarah Cottrell, Richardson's energy and climate policy adviser.\ The member states will design a market-based system known as ""cap and trade"" -- capping greenhouse gas emissions and allowing less polluting industries to sell or trade their unused emissions credit to more polluting companies. ""It needs to be comprehensive so we're not picking on one sector,"" Cottrell said.\ Still, it will take more than the cap and trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough to make a dent in the damage it's already causing. The climate partner states are looking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 85 percent by 2050 ""to reduce the most serious consequences of global warming.""\ The meeting drew a diverse group of public land managers, environmentalists and industry representatives.\ Environment Department Secretary Ron Curry has taken a whirlwind climate tour from Congress to California in the last few weeks to promote New Mexico's greenhouse gas reduction goals.\ ""What's happening in New Mexico with regard to climate change is moving so quickly, it's hard to digest how much is being achieved,"" Curry told Thursday's gathering. ""This is an important time in the history of our state and nation.""\ The Clean Car Standard was one of the recommendations of the Governor's Climate Change Advisory group. The Environment Department will ask the Environmental Improvement Board in November to join 12 other states that have already adopted the standards that include California's ultra-low tailpipe emissions regulations and encourages car manufacturers to use recyclable, low-toxic materials.\ Curry said his staff also will ask the board in October to require mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in the state.\ At least a half-dozen state agencies have goals and deadlines to meet under the state's climate plan.\ One challenge to the state is the emissions from existing and proposed coal-fired power plants on the Navajo Nation, over which the state has no control. Desert Rock is a proposed 1,500-megawatt plant and joint venture between the tribe and Sithe Global near Shiprock. It is designed to lower mercury, sulfur and nitrous emissions, but not carbon dioxide. ""If it is built in its current design, it will present a big challenge to reaching our target reductions,"" Cottrell said.\ All sectors of the economy could be impacted by efforts to reduce emissions -- from commercial and residential to agriculture and forestry. For more information on the climate initiatives and how to comment, see the New Mexico Environment Department Web site at www.nmenv.state.nm.us.\ Contact Staci Matlock at 470-9843."
24," New Mexico regulators are decrying a federal plan to give coal- fired power plants and other large-scale producers of mercury pollution some flexibility in how they reduce emissions.\ Public Service Company of New Mexico's coal-fired Four Corners Generating Station produces electrical power for Santa Fe and other cities. State officials say smoke from such plants in New Mexico puts about a ton of mercury into the air every year.\ Mercury is harmful to people and causes developmental disorders in children. It accumulates in animals, and state agencies have issued repeated warnings against eating fish in many areas because of high mercury levels.\ The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is leaning toward adopting a regulation on mercury emissions that would allow power- plant operators to trade pollution credits among themselves on the open market.\ In theory, the EPA proposal could allow some power-plant operators to buy credits for years instead of making immediate strides toward reducing mercury emissions. Federal officials, however, say they believe the so-called ""cap and trade"" approach will lead to lower emissions.\ The New Mexico Environment Department opposes the EPA proposal, saying it weakens mercury regulations proposed by the Clinton administration.\ The Clinton plan would have required plants to install filters or other mechanisms to reduce emissions. This so-called ""maximum achievable control technology"" approach would result in lower emissions, state officials say.\ Michael Leavitt, administrator of the EPA, will make a decision on the matter by the end of the year.\ The EPA announced its intention to adopt a rule on mercury emissions in January and promptly held three meetings on the East Coast to discuss the proposal.\ In response to requests from Gov. Bill Richardson and others to hold a public hearing in the West, the EPA recently agreed to hold a meeting March 31 in Denver.\ John Millett, spokesman for the EPA in Washington, said Thursday that agency officials favor the ""cap and trade"" approach ""because they feel it will achieve deeper cuts over a longer period of time than the maximum achievable control technology.""\ Millett said the ability to sell pollution credits to other operators would give industry an incentive to reduce emissions quickly. ""One anticipated benefit of that would be steep early reductions of mercury in order to build up credits to be in a beneficial trading position,"" he said.\ Sandra Ely, air quality bureau chief with the New Mexico Environment Department, said Thursday her department believes that simply requiring industry to comply with the most stringent possible limits on mercury emissions is the best approach if it's done correctly.\ Using the best technology, it's possible to remove about 90 percent of mercury from coal-plant emissions, Ely said. She said the EPA itself estimates that the ""cap and trade"" approach will achieve only about a 70 percent reduction in emissions by 2018.\ ""There's no doubt that this is a poison that needs to be dealt with, and we don't think that the administration is dealing with it appropriately,"" Ely said.\ While private industry has generally favored ""cap and trade"" programs for other air pollutants, Ely said mercury demands special treatment given that it accumulates in people's bodies.\ ""I don't think that it's appropriate to control every pollutant through a cap-and-trade program,"" Ely said. ""And when you're talking about neurotoxins, I don't think it's a good idea.""\ The public should make its feelings known to the EPA, Ely said.\ Amy Miller, spokeswoman for PNM in Albuquerque, said Thursday that the company hasn't taken a position on whether it would favor a ""cap and trade"" program or a flat requirement that coal-fired plants install the maximum achievable technology.\ ""Typically, we have supported cap and trade plans,"" Miller said."

CARLSBAD -- ""It's not over until the Legislative session is over.""
\
Those were the fighting words of Sen. Carroll Leavell, R-Eddy, after a bill he co-sponsored to repeal cap and trade rules was tabled in committee on Tuesday.
\
""I lost it in the Judiciary Committee with a vote of 7-4. It went down straight by party line vote,"" Leavell said. ""I guess the Democrat committee members like the Environmental Improvement Board rules. We can resuscitate it by having a majority on the Senate floor. But we need 42 votes to move it out of the Judiciary Committee. I just hope it doesn't get reassigned to that committee. There are other two options for committee reassignment of the bill. It could be sent to the Senate Conservation Committee or the Senate Corporation Committee.""
\
Leavell and Sen. David Ulibarri. D-Grants, sponsored Senate Bill 190 that calls for the repeal of cap and trade rules adopted by the State Environmental Improvement Board in the final weeks of the previous administration.
\
Leavell said SB 190 will improve the business climate by repealing the damaging environmental rules over greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The cap and trade rule sets a limit on carbon dioxide emission and allows those who exceed the limit to buy credits from those who have credits to spare.
\
SB190 would repeal four adopted rules. The bill would repeal the rules that place a cap on emissions of greenhouse gases; would repeal requirements for reporting and verifying greenhouse gas emissions for a cap and trade program; and it would repeal the rule that adopted a cap and trade program for the state.
\
The bill also has an emergency clause that would make the legislation effective immediately after it is signed into law.
\
Rep. Bill Gray, R- Eddy, a strong opponent of cap and trade, said he has been told there is a bill similar to SB190 that is going to be introduced in the senate.
\
""The key to SB 190 -- and the other bill -- is to keep it out of the Judiciary Committee. I know there will be a strong push to keep it out of there,"" he said, adding that lobbyists from the oil and gas industry around the state are making their presence known. They are lobbying hard to get the cap and trade rules repealed.
\
Gray said should the Leavell bill or a similar bill pass in the senate, it will move to the House.
\
""It will go to the House Energy Committee,"" Gray explained. ""If it gets there, it's going to be still tough. There are 12 members on the committee - six Republicans and six Democrats. To get it through they will have to convince the other side of the aisle to go along with it.""
\
Gray said if legislation fails, plan B is for the new Environment Improvement Board to undo what the previous board did.
\
""When Gov, Martinez picked members for the EIB board, she quizzed them on their position on cap and trade. She is against it, so it would probably be repealed. But it would take longer. It would be much quicker getting it done legislatively,"" Gray said.

SANTA FE - The New Mexico Environment Department is asking a state regulatory panel to consider a proposed regulation to cap and trade greenhouse gas emissions in the state.
\
The department announced Friday that it has filed a petition seeking a hearing before the Environmental Improvement Board.
\
The proposal would enable the state to participate in a regional cap and trade program. One condition is New Mexico would only participate if there are enough pollution allowances within the region to make the program efficient and cost effective.
\
The proposal also includes language that would end the state regulation if the federal government implements an ""equally effective"" cap and trade program.
\
The department says the proposal included in the petition was changed to reflect public comments the agency had received.

FARMINGTON -- Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Turner said he filed a lawsuit Friday intended to head-off new emissions regulations being considered by the state Environment Department.
\
The legal action requests a temporary restraining order against Gov. Bill Richardson as a catch-all approach to prevent the state Environment Department from filing a proposed emissions cap-and-trade regulation with the governor-appointed Environmental Improvement Board.
\
The lawsuit, prepared to be filed in a Santa Fe state district court, was announced Friday at San Juan College while Turner was campaigning in the Farmington area.
\
The Environment Dep-artment in March published proposed regulations that could establish an emissions cap-and-trade program in New Mexico. The outlined rules are expected to be submitted in a petition to the Environmental Improvement Board in June.
\
The new emissions rules are timed by the state administration to be enacted before the November general election, Turner claimed.
\
""The timing of the proposed regulation does not give the citizens of New Mexico and interested groups enough time to consider broad and sweeping regulation that will drastically affect the state's economy,"" a draft of Turner's legal filing states.
\
A similar petition filed by the environmental advocacy group New Energy Economy already is under consideration by the Environmental Improvement Board. A lawsuit is pending in that case as opponents of the emissions regulations claim the EIB does not have authority to impose such rules. No court decision was made in that case following an April 1 hearing.
\
""The idea here is just to stop a potential train wreck, stop the, I think, abuse of rule-making process that circumvents the people who were elected in the state, namely the state Legislature,"" Turner said of his legal action.
\
Amid a competitive race for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, Turner acknowledged his court action is politically motivated.
\
""That we are in Farmington is representative of a community that could potentially suffer,"" said Turner, an Albuquerque business owner. ""It's important here.""
\
Environment Department Secretary Ron Curry blasted the proposed court action as baseless.
\
""This injunction is premature, particularly since the Environment Department has not yet filed a petition for hearing concerning greenhouse gas emissions,"" Curry said in a prepared statement. ""This is an unfortunate attempt by a gubernatorial candidate to grab a headline rather than offering real solutions for addressing climate change. This is also a waste of taxpayers' money on state resources to defend such a baseless legal action.""

SANTA FE -- New Mexico Economic Development Secretary Jon Barela told a delegation from Carlsbad he strongly believes his department must work with communities around the state to help them - and the state as a whole - to remain competitive and economically strong.
\
A delegation of 50 local business, community and education leaders descended on Santa Fe Monday to meet with cabinet secretaries and legislators. Dubbing themselves the Bat Brigade, the delegation split into groups and made the rounds at the state capital and other departments.
\
Barela listened to the concerns of Carlsbad's business representatives who told him the problems they have encountered with the state Environment Department and its bureaucratic red tape.
\
Carlsbad Businessman Frank Witt provided Barela an example of how difficult he believes it is doing business in the state. He said with the current reconstruction of Canal Street, the contractor, James Hamilton Construction, needed a permit to crush and recycle the concrete and asphalt ripped up from the road. But, according to Witt, the Environment Department held up the permit because of a lack of knowledge by someone in the state office.
\
""They asked that the contractor send them photos of the site where they wanted to take the asphalt and concrete to crush. They did as they were asked. The permit was held up again because the Environment Department saw some round structures in the photo,"" Witt said. ""They wanted to know if people were living in the structures. The structures were actually tank batteries.""
\
Barela said Witt's story is not the first he has heard about the Environment Department, and he pledged to do whatever he can to help businesses continue to be economically viable and productive.
\
""Tell me what you need to help in your community. We will work with the Environment Department and other state regulatory agencies,"" Barela told the Carlsbad delegation. ""Local people know what's best for the community and it should not be hard to do business with the state. I want to get one-stop shopping for small businesses where they can come and get the answer to all their questions. It may not be the answer you want to hear, but we will give you an answer.""
\
Barela said his department needs to work not only well with the business communities around the state, but also with the federal government.
\
""I know Carlsbad knows how to work with the federal government,"" he said. ""I saw that when I worked for Congressman (Joe) Skeen. Carlsbad worked hard to get WIPP (the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant) open.""
\
John Waters, Carlsbad Department of Development executive director, voiced concern over oil and gas regulations and the cap and trade regulations that were passed last November by the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board.
\
""It needs to be repealed as soon as possible,"" Waters said. ""The oil, and particularly the natural gas industries in Eddy County, was hard hit by the one-size-fits-all regulations imposed by the last administration. These rules should be site-specific and based on science.""
\
Waters added that he believes that the cap and trade program passed at the eleventh hour by the outgoing Environmental Improvement Board will literally cripple business in all of rural New Mexico through increased power and operating expenses. He said Carlsbad's potash industry would be hit hard financially.
\
""It will do nothing to protect the environment,"" Waters said. ""But it does help our neighboring states like Texas and Colorado to offer comparatively lower power and operational costs to their impressive list of incentives they already offer prospective companies.""
\
Barela said Gov. Susana Martinez has appointed a new Environmental Improvement Board and he assured that the cap and trade regulations will be repealed. He said Martinez is against cap and trade and in his opinion, it is certainly detrimental to the state's economic well-being.
\
Members of the Bat Brigade also met with Toni Balzano, a Carlsbad High School graduate who is the acting tourism secretary. She is also cousin to Eddy County Commissioner Jack Volpato.
\
Balzano said her department is working much leaner, meaning with fewer people and a smaller budget. On top of that, the department is facing a possible merger with other departments.
\
In a move to streamline state government and cut costs, the Legislature is considering a merger of three cabinet-level departments that include the tourism, economic development departments and Work Force Solutions.
\
The Carlsbad delegation that met with Balzano told her they are against her department merging with the other departments.
\
""We will do whatever we can to help you from that happening,"" said Ken Britt, spokesman for the Carlsbad group.
\
Stopping at the Round House to visit with Eddy County legislators, the issue of the merger was brought up.
\
""We need the tourism department to remain on its own,"" said Dave Rogers, a local pastor and strong promoter of Carlsbad.
\
But Sen. Carroll Leavell, a Republican from Lea and Eddy counties, gave little hope that the department will survive the proposed merger.
\
""We have so many cabinet members now that they can't all get into the cabinet room,"" Leavell said, adding that merging departments abolishes a number of cabinet-level positions and saves money.

30,"Elizabeth Kolbert's recent lecture at the Lensic Performing Arts Center concerning global warming included the usual suspects, such as deforestation, coal-burning power plants, gas-guzzling cars and trucks and a myriad of other human activities. Though she was long on cause and effect, she was shy on the ""why.""\She showed dramatic slides of Alaskan coastal villages being gobbled up by the ocean. Because of melting permafrost, huge sink holes have suddenly been appearing on the campus of the University of Alaska, and forests are leaning over like drunken sailors. Based on ice core samples, her charts and graphs depicted the history of the earth's temperature fluctuations over the past 400 thousand years. Modern human activity has literally spiked the data off the charts.\To this aged tree hugger, her presentation looked like dej vu all over again. As a member of several environmental groups since my college days in the late 60s, I am wondering why it has taken us so long to finally see the forest for the trees. Way back then all of those organizations and a group of concerned environmental scientists called The Club of Rome were trying to show us the handwriting on the wall. Unfortunately, the general public preferred to shoot the messengers, and the mainstream media relegated the warnings to page 12 of section C.\So here we are now fast approaching the tipping point when there will be no going back. We have cut so many strands of the web of life that dire consequences might very well be unavoidable. The days of silver-bullet solutions are far behind us and drastic measures are about our only option. Changing out a few light bulbs, over-inflating our tires and taking the bus now and then ain't gonna cut it because all of the environmental problems we now face can be traced back to one thing -- the impact of over-population and its ugly twin of over-consumption. We simply have to stop making babies. If you absolutely must have a child, adopt one of the many who need a good home.\There is a new catch-phrase called ""carbon footprint."" Industries refer to it as ""cap and trade"" or carbon overload based on their propensity to pollute the environment. Technically speaking, all of us and every child go through life leaving an ever-increasing carbon footprint of consumption and cast-off, especially in developed countries such as the U.S. and Western Europe.\It is time to get serious about reproductive rights. I envision a system of rewarding people for not having children. Free vasectomies for men and free tubal ligations for women should be readily available. Tax deduction incentives for bearing children should be eliminated and replaced by rewards for married couples who remain childless.\Granted, because of religious beliefs, maternal instincts, male egos and family traditions, my proposal would be a very hard sell, but because human reproduction is the ""why"" of the possible demise of our species, it must be addressed immediately.\If you want to see the startling hypothesis of my beliefs visit www.grothismadness.org or www.overpopulation.org or www.balance.org. At www.cosmosmith.com/human-population-crisis.htm watch the tallying population clock, and you might be convinced that the only decisions we have left are drastic ones.\Warren Dunn lives in Santa Fe and says he's ""proud to be a lifelong, kid-free environmentalist."""
31," Big questions loom about how New Mexico and other western states will meet their goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.\ And the eight U.S. western states and Canadian provinces partnered in the Western Climate Initiative have only a year to come up with answers.\ State environment officials met with industry and environmental representatives Thursday in Santa Fe to detail the work plan for developing a market-based system to reduce emissions by 15 percent below 2005 levels within 13 years.\ The meeting at the state Environment Department headquarters was the first in a series of New Mexico meetings about the initiative, which is expected to rely on a cap-andtrade program in which there are economic incentives for companies to pollute less. Under such a system, the government sets a cap on the amount of pollutants that can be emitted.\ Companies and other emitters of greenhouse gases are given allowances for how much they can pollute. Companies that need to pollute beyond their limit can then purchase additional allowances from those that pollute less.\ But which sectors of the economy will be subject to the program still needs to be determined, officials said Thursday. That's because while it's easy to track emissions from the electric industry, for example, but calculating how much the agricultural sector is polluting is trickier.\ Another question: whether the pollution credits should be given away free, auctioned off or transferred through combination of the two approaches.\ Five subcommittees made up of representatives from the participating states and provinces will tackle these and other issues over the next year with the goal of having the outlines of a capand-trade program completed by August 2008.\ The initiative comes as states across the country are taking steps to curb climate change in response to what critics consider a lack of leadership on the issue in Washington.\ ""At the federal level in the United States there's an absence of strong action on climate change,"" said Sarah Cottrell, Gov. Bill Richardson's energy and environmental policy adviser.\ The Western Climate Initiative is made up of Arizona, California, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington and the provinces of British Columbia and Manitoba.\ The initiative could present a challenge to states like New Mexico that include tribal lands, where the state regulators have no jurisdiction.\ Jeff Burkes of PNM, participating in the meeting via speaker phone, said New Mexico was proposing to shift the burden for reducing emissions from sectors of the economy that the state can't regulate -- like those on reservations -- to industries that it can.\ But in the case of a proposed coal-fired power plant on Navajo reservation, the pollutants likely won't count towards the state's total emissions levels under the cap-and-trade system anyway, because the electricity is expected to be exported out of state, said Jim Norton, director of the state Environment Protection Division.\ The meeting was attended by about 40 representatives of the oil and gas industry, environmental groups, state agencies and other stakeholders.\ Jennifer Knowlton of Yates Petroleum Corp. in Artesia, N.M., said it was critical that the subcommittees listen to industry input throughout the development of the cap-and-trade system. What may look good on paper, she said, could prove impractical for the companies that have to implement the policy.\ Erik Schlenker-Goodrich of the Western Environmental Law Center said it was important that the participation by industry not ""drag down the process.""\ The partnering states have not set goals beyond 2020. Current science suggests that rolling back threats to the climate will require worldwide reductions of between 50 percent and 85 percent in carbon dioxide emissions from current levels by 2050, according to www.westernclimateinitiative.org.\ The regional, economy-wide goal for 2020 does not replace states' existing goals. In 2006, Richardson issued an executive order laying out a plan that calls for reducing carbon dioxide and methane emissions from oil and gas operations."
32," Air polluters in New Mexico will have a chance to voluntarily reduce their emissions under a haze-reduction program state regulators announced Tuesday.\ Industry and environmental groups alike praised the New Mexico Environment Department's choice of the voluntary approach to complying with a federal rule that requires states to take action to control haze.\ The federal government requires all states to make substantial progress toward returning visibility in key parks and national monuments to natural conditions by the year 2064.\ New Mexico and most other Western states had a choice between the voluntary approach and an option that would have required polluters to install particular pollution-control technology on their plants.\ Sandra Ely, chief of the Air Quality Bureau at the Environment Department, said polluters in New Mexico will have until 2012 to meet emission-reduction requirements. If they fail to meet them, she said the state will implement a ""cap and trade"" program. It would force plants that exceed requirements to purchase from others in the same industry the right to emit pollution in excess of standards. The threat of such a program provides a stiff financial incentive to comply voluntarily.\ ""I expect to see that that cap-and-trade program won't go into effect, that we will get those voluntary reductions,"" Ely said. ""Industry says that they will get their emissions down to such a point that we won't have to enter into a cap-and-trade program, and I believe them.""\ The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency enacted its Regional Haze Rule in 1999, requiring states to curtail pollution to improve air quality at 156 parks and national monuments around the country. Among those in New Mexico are Wheeler Peak, Bandelier National Monument, Bosque del Apache Wildlife Refuge and others.\ 'What we'll eventually see is clearer skies in our Class One areas,"" Ely said. ""Our goal is to enhance the beauty of some of the most pristine areas of the state.""\ Ron Curry, New Mexico environment secretary, said the decision to allow industry to undertake voluntary pollution measures will result in quicker action than the option of requiring specific technology on particular plants.\ ""By using the approach developed by Westerners for Westerners, (the environment department) will be able to begin working to decrease haze now and not put off tough decisions,"" Curry said.\ Phelps Dodge Mining Co., which operates copper mines in southwestern New Mexico, had encouraged the state to choose the voluntary approach to reducing emissions.\ ""We think it's a reasonable way to go forward because it builds on an existing regulatory framework that we understand,"" Richard Peterson, spokesman for Phelps Dodge in Silver City, said Tuesday.\ Phelps Dodge has two copper smelters in New Mexico but neither is operating now, Peterson said. He said the haze-reduction rule will require a reduction in sulfur-dioxide levels during any future operation, but said the company believes it can meet the levels.\ Amy Miller, spokeswoman with Public Service Company of New Mexico in Albuquerque, said Tuesday the company likes the approach the state chose because it gives the company some regulatory certainty. The federal government hasn't yet announced what pollution-control measures it would require under the other haze-reduction option.\ Jon Goldstein, spokesman for the state environment department, said Tuesday that the New Mexico Citizens for Clean Air and Water, an environmental group, also supported the haze-reduction option the state chose. An attempt to reach a spokesperson for the group was unsuccessful on Tuesday."

SILVER CITY The evidence that the climate is growing warmer is overwhelming, but the usage of greenhouse gas-producing fossil fuels is not decreasing, said retired U.S. Senator and former Silver City resident Jeff Bingaman.
\
Bingaman was in Silver City on Friday speaking on energy and climate challenges for the Western Institute for Lifelong Learning at Western New Mexico University's Global Resource Center auditorium.
\
Bingaman's talk was titled ""Meeting the World's Energy and Climate Challenges,"" and the former senator discussed the world's use of fossil fuels and the importance of aligning energy and environmental policies.
\
During his career in the Senate, Bingaman earned a reputation as being an advocate for the environment.
\
Bingaman and former Secretary of State and Treasurer George Shultz co-authored ""The State Clean Energy Cookbook"" last year, Bingaman said. Published by the Stanford University Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance, the report is available at the website steyertaylor.stanford.edu/statepolicyreport.
\
""The report observes that with growing gridlock in Washington, states throughout the country -- both red and blue -- are implementing innovative renewable energy and energy efficiency programs which could be adopted by their neighbors to improve their economies and reduce emissions cost-effectively,"" the website states.
\
These policies could be particularly valuable for states in meeting pending regulations by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to cut carbon emissions.
\
According to the website, the report reaches ""an encouraging conclusion"" noting, ""Both red states and blue states are turning green -- whether measured in dollar savings or environmental improvement.""
\
Bingaman has served as an elected official both in the state of New Mexico as well as representing the people of this state in the United States Senate.
\
He was born in El Paso and attended public schools of Silver City, according to a news release from the Western Institute for Lifelong Learning.
\
He graduated from Harvard University in 1965 and then from Stanford Law School in 1968 which led to his admission to the New Mexico bar that year. He became assistant New Mexico attorney general in 1969 and a counsel to the state constitutional convention in 1969. He entered private law practice in 1970. He served in the United States Army Reserve from 1968-74, according to the release.
\
Bingaman was elected attorney general of New Mexico and served from 1979-82. In 1982, he was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate and served in that capacity for 30 years.
\
Bingaman's Senate career included being chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, as well as serving as a member of a number of committees, including the Armed Services Committee, Finance, Joint Economic Committee, and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
\
Since 2006, Bingaman had worked on a bill that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions via a ""cap and trade"" system. His goal was to see his plan implemented so that emissions would be reduced to 1990 levels by 2030. In the Senate, Bingaman was a backer of the Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012, which would have given federal help to all low-carbon electricity producers. It did not pass.
\
In February, 2011, he announced that he would not seek re-election for a sixth term in 2012. Upon his retirement, Bingaman accepted a fellowship at Stanford in 2013 to specialize in renewable energy.
\
Bingaman served as a distinguished fellow for one year, working to develop policies to assist states and local communities in promoting increased use of clean energy.
\
In 2014, ""The State Clean Energy Cookbook"" was published by Stanford University.
\
Getting a control on greenhouse gases has been a focus of Bingaman's environmental policies, and by implementing efforts at the state level, from the bottom up, Bingaman said there was hope for eventual change.
\
""Whether or not that change will be enough, or will come in time to reverse the damage that we have done with our emissions, we don't know,"" Bingaman said.
\
As Western countries begin looking at improving the quality of the environment, the emerging nations of the world, especially China, are rapidly increasing their use of fossil fuels and the resultant emissions.
\
Meanwhile, improving the environment at home entails cost, and power companies are loathe to pay the initial expense of moving to alternative energy sources, which would ultimately land on the consumer, he said.
\
""Bringing an end to carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere would be reflected in the cost of energy, which means higher prices, and there is great resistance to that, both from the consumer and the energy companies,"" Bingaman said.

34," Sen. Jeff Bingaman just got the go-ahead to guide our nation out of its rut as the world's biggest belcher of greenhouse gases.\ He's chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee -- and Monday's two Supreme Court rulings confirming government authority to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases gives Congress all the constitutional muscle it needs to go after global warming in a big way.\ Bingaman quickly extended a hand of cooperation to the White House, which our country's highest court had just backhanded for its unwillingness to confront global warming.\ Bush's Environmental Protection Agency, said the court, must reconsider its bashfulness about regulating emissions -- and it must face the growing scientific evidence of the harm our carbon- burning society does to this fragile planet.\ Between Congress and the EPA, Bingaman figures, our country can meet the challenge our leaders too long have dodged.\ Bingaman has long advocated a ""cap-and-trade"" approach: The EPA sets a limit, or puts a cap, on the amount of pollutant an industry and its products can emit. The responsible companies are given emissions allowances, since hardly anything is emissions-free.\ Companies exceeding those allowances must buy the right to do it from companies or organizations that come in under the limit. That's the ""trade"" part of the cap-and-trade system.\ Complicated? Oh, yeah. But doable? Uh-huh.\ New Mexico Environment Secretary Ron Curry already has made our state a part of something called the Chicago Climate Exchange, dedicated to emissions-reduction. Fellow members include DuPont, IBM -- and, perhaps most important, Ford, whether sincerely or merely for public-relations purposes; automobiles, even in this era of catalytic converters and fuel efficiency, remain major spewers of carbon, in monoxide and dioxide form.\ Car manufacturers lately have seen the handwriting on the wall, so few were shocked by the court decisions. Many are willing to knuckle under new laws and rules -- which makes us wonder why America's Big Three weren't doing more in recent years to reduce pollution. Were they waiting for Japanese or European competitors to beat them once more to the punch?\ At any rate, they say they'll take an economywide approach to global warming -- and that, from companies too long in denial about the stuff coming out of their tailpipes, is good; so is Detroit's promise to deliver cleaner-combusting engines with its 2009 line of cars.\ But Bingaman can't just sit back and applaud; he's got to lead the charge toward energy-policy reform on many fronts. Felizmente, we're seeing early signs of a freshly roused lawmaker; more about that in a few days ...\ Monday's main decision was 5-4, with Bush appointees Samuel Alito and John Roberts joining Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in a minority reduced to quibbling over the ""standing"" of lead plaintiff Massachusetts and 11 other states, including New Mexico, to challenge the EPA's laxity.\ But its second Clean Air Act decision of the day, a broad reading of the Environmental Protection Agency's authority over factories and power plants that add capacity or make renovations that increase emissions of air pollutants, went 9-0 in favor of stiffening the EPA's spine.\ Monday was a day of bold decisions on behalf of an endangered globe; decisions on which Sen. Bingaman and the rest of the slim majority of Congressional Democrats should act -- with or without the help of Republicans who for far too long have dragged their heels."

ALBUQUERQUE (AP) -- New Mexico's largest electric utilities, the oil and natural gas industry and others are seeking to have the state's greenhouse gas emissions rules overturned. Petitions to repeal the rules were filed late last week with the state Environmental Improvement Board (EIB). The board was expected to decide Aug. 1 whether the case will go forward. Championed by former Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson and environmentalists, the rules are aimed at establishing a cap-and-trade program and curbing greenhouse gas emissions among coal-fired power plants, refineries and other large polluters. The rules were approved in the waning weeks of Richardson's tenure. Republican Gov. Susana Martinez, a vocal opponent of the state's effort to control carbon emissions, has called the effort a ""cap and tax."" The utilities and industry groups argued in the petitions that the rules will have devastating consequences for New Mexico's economy. Each petition targets a specific element of the greenhouse gas emissions program -- reduction of emissions, cap and trade and the reporting of emissions by those industries affected by the rules. The groups said the limited availability of cost-effective technologies for controlling emissions and the cost of purchasing offsets to comply with the cap would make for a significant financial burden. ""This burden will mean that companies will be faced with difficult choices, including investing less in their New Mexico operations or shutting those operations down to meet the reductions required under the rule. Of course, the costs of compliance by the utility sector will be passed back to New Mexico customers,"" one petition states. The groups also argue the rules do not have any discernible benefits to human health or the environment given that New Mexico's carbon emissions ""barely register in the context of national and international emissions."" Supporters argue otherwise, saying they will defend the rules before the Environmental Improvement Board and through the court system. Mariel Nanasi, executive director of New Energy Economy (NEE), the environmental group that initially petitioned the board in December 2008 for a carbon emissions reduction program, said she suspected the board will move forward with the petitions since its members were appointed by Martinez. She also accused the industry groups of meeting with the board prior to filing the petitions. ""This is a biased board, period,"" she said. ""The party who is in front of the board that's supposed to be adjudicating it, judging it, had discussions before the petition was even filed. We've never heard of such a thing."" One of the petitioners, Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM), also took its case to the Court of Appeals soon after the rules were approved. In June, the court sent the case back to the Environmental Improvement Board, and NEE filed a motion with the state Supreme Court seeking to intervene. New Energy Economy said in court filings it's concerned the fate of the rule would be ""entirely in the hands opponents -- PNM and the newly appointed members of the EIB."" PNM contends proponents of the rules would have an opportunity to voice their position, either in the appellate court or during hearings before the board. The other parties who have petitioned the board to repeal the rules include the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Southwestern Public Service Company, the Independent Petroleum Association of New Mexico, the city of Farmington and its electric utility and El Paso Electric Co. Louis Rose, an attorney representing the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, said his clients are hopeful the board will agree to hear the petitions. However, even if it does, the process of reconsidering the rules will likely take months. ""We don't expect to even get to a hearing any sooner than November,"" he said, pointing to notice requirements under state statutes. The initial battle over regulating greenhouse gas emissions also took months. Several public meetings were held, court briefs were filed and board members reviewed 200 hours of technical testimony, public comments and complex documents relating to proposals from both New Energy Economy and the state Environment Department before reaching a decision.
"
36,"The New Mexican\Public Service Company of New Mexico, Navajo Refining and more than a dozen other companies will be affected by a preliminary rule for a greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program released this week by the state Environment Department. The rule is meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which scientists believe are a contributor to climate change. The department is seeking public comment on the draft rule by May 28 and must file the rule with the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board.\A cap-and-trade program sets a limit on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that can be produced each year. Companies that emit greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are allotted a certain number of emissions ""allowances"" and can trade with each other. \The proposed rule only applies to sources emitting more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide a year, an estimated 63 facilities. Most are coal or natural gas power generation stations and other oil and gas facilities. The rule allows companies to postpone compliance until 2015.\New Mexico will only use the rule if enough partners in the Western Climate Initiative regional program participate to make a cap-and-trade program cost effective. The WCI states include California, Washington, Oregon, Utah, Montana, Arizona and New Mexico.\Public comments can be submitted through the Department's Web site by May 28 at www.nmenv.state.nm.us/cc/. The Environment Department will meet with stakeholders about the proposed rule, including a meeting at the Santa Fe Community College from 4 to 6 p.m. Tuesday."
37,"Greenhouse-gas regulations, \rule-making process under fire as legislative session begins\By Staci Matlock\The New Mexican\Environmentalists say they're fighting to hold on to gains made in recent years, while oil, gas and utility representatives, with support from newly elected Gov. Susana Martinez, are trying to roll back regulations they say hurt New Mexico businesses.\""We're looking at a defensive session here,"" longtime Sierra Club lobbyist Dan Lorimier said of the 2-month lawmaking session that got under way last week in Santa Fe. ""We're going to try and hold the Legislature to their decisions to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink.""\Representatives of various industries, looking for help from the new Republican administration and a more politically conservative Legislature, say it's time to change the way rules and regulations are adopted.\""These rules are done by boards that are not elected,"" said Beverlee McClure, president of the 1,400-member Association of Commerce and Industry of New Mexico. \""People tend to say this is an oil-and-gas issue. But it is really a small-business issue. They don't have the money to hire attorneys for all these rule hearings and to get through the regulatory quagmire.""\Sen. Peter Wirth, D-Santa Fe, hopes there's a way to avoid a big fight between oil-and-gas interests and what he and others see as policies that support the state's best possibility of a stable future economy: clean energy. \""We are an oil-and-gas state,"" he said. ""There is no question that is a very important part of our economy. At the same time, we don't want to see a fight between green energy and oil and gas to the point we undo all the work we've done in the last eight years, just for a resource that is finite.""\Battling over \cap and trade\The governor-appointed state Environmental Improvement Board spent a couple of years sitting through dozens of hours of testimony and sifting through hundreds of pages of documents before approving two greenhouse-gas emissions rules in the fall. Both are aimed at reducing and capping carbon emissions from large producers such as coal-fired power plants, oil refineries and natural-gas plants.\Industry representatives fought against state adoption of the rules, saying the rules would raise costs and make them less competitive with businesses elsewhere.\Both Martinez and her Democratic gubernatorial rival, Diane Denish, opposed the state's greenhouse-gas rule during their campaigns. Denish argued that any effort to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions must be global and national, not state-by-state. \Martinez has said she thinks the rule is not only anti-business but also does little to help the environment and isn't based on ""sound science.""\Martinez is blocking enforcement of the greenhouse-gas emissions rule and other rules by preventing their publication in the state Register, a move that environmental activists are challenging in court. The governor has given a task force 90 days to review the rules ""and determine which ones are productive and which ones need to be altered or eliminated.""\Meanwhile, state Sen. Clint Harden, R-Clovis, filed a bill, SB 91, that would suspend the recently approved rules for greenhouse-gas emissions, the cap-and-trade system and clean-car standards until they have been reviewed. The bill would give agencies 180 days to reconsider the rules through a new hearing. Failing that, the rules would simply be suspended.\Rep. Mary Ellen Garcia, D-Las Cruces, introduced HB 22, which would require agencies to evaluate the economic, social and environmental impacts of rules on people and businesses. And Aztec Republican Sen. Steven P. Neville has proposed a joint memorial to amend the state constitution so that the Legislature could overturn any agency rule with a two-thirds vote in both chambers.\Steve Henke, president of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, said the new rules ""put a regulatory burden and extra costs on our producers, refiners and transporters that are not borne by our competitors in other states.""\Henke said the rules would affect 63 sites, including power utility companies, oil refineries and natural-gas processing plants. He worries the requirement for companies to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by 3 percent a year from 2010 levels will drive some out of the state or out of business. \""Common sense would say compliance with this rule is going to cost,"" Henke said. ""And those costs cannot be passed on to consumers because this is an interstate market.""\He added, ""Obviously, we want to unwind those regulations as quickly and effectively as possible. I don't think there's any question it puts our refiners and processors at a disadvantage regionally.""\In the name of jobs\Sen. Peter Wirth, D-Santa Fe, said he's worried about the direction the Martinez administration has taken in pushing back recent environmental rules in the name of jobs. \""I think the last eight years, with the efforts we've taken to protect the environment and to use our green energy resources as a clean economic driver in the state, she's putting jobs at risk here,"" Wirth said. ""Certainly, oil and gas represents jobs, but people forget how many renewable-energy jobs have been created. We're right on the cusp of moving New Mexico forward as a leader in clean energy. I worry if we roll back all the steps we've taken, we're going in the wrong direction with this state's future economic development.""\Oil and gas help drive the state's economy, both in terms of jobs and revenue. The industry supported 15,000 direct jobs and 13,000 to 17,000 service-related jobs in 2009. Taxes on the industry provide 15 percent of the state's general fund.\While the total number of jobs in clean energy still lags, advocates say the potential for growth in the nascent market is better than in the oil-and-gas market. A 2009 Pew report on the Clean Energy Economy found 577 New Mexico ""clean businesses"" had generated 4,815 jobs in 2007 -- a 50 percent increase from 1998 -- and investors put $147.9 million in venture capital into state clean-energy projects. \New Mexico is ranked highly for potential utility-scale solar, wind and geothermal projects, in addition to having the brain trust and space for developing new products and manufacturing.\The greenhouse-gas emissions rules, along with requirements for state utilities to purchase more renewable energy, will drive innovation and jobs, advocates claim. Business Facilities magazine in 2010 ranked New Mexico eighth for economic growth potential, fifth among alternative energy business leaders and second for solar energy manufacturing.\Martinez, Henke and others in the oil-and-gas industry say the greenhouse-gas emissions rules make New Mexico less competitive and drive production jobs to other states. They say it makes little sense to let those rules stand when they will do little to actually reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.\New Mexico began working on greenhouse-gas emissions rules as part of a regional group, the Western Climate Initiative, which included Western states and Canada. But New Mexico has been one of the few to follow through on the process.\Wirth sees a connection between environmental issues and another major industry. \""Tourism is our second-biggest economic driver, especially in parts that aren't oil and gas. Our environment, our landscapes play an incredible role in the product we have to offer,"" Wirth said. ""If we've got drilling rigs going up everywhere, we are basically saying goodbye to a huge portion of that economic base. There has to be a balance, because we're playing with jobs on both sides of this discussion.""\McClure of the Association of Commerce and Industry of New Mexico said renewable energy is a great and growing sector of the economy. \""But we have to be honest that so far that sector of our economy hasn't been that strong,"" she said. \Martinez agrees. ""As we work to harness these new energy sources, we must recognize that New Mexicans now receive \90 percent of their electricity from coal-fired power plants and that percentage is not likely to drastically change overnight,"" she said. \As for jobs: If climate-change predictions by hundreds of climate scientists prove correct, there will be direct and lasting impacts on New Mexico's economy, not to mention the environment, in the years ahead. \In May, a dozen Sandia National Laboratory scientists drafted a 259-page report looking at the near-term risk of climate change on individual state economies. \The picture, at various estimates of risk, isn't pretty. Basically, the report found that the more-severe droughts in the Southwest induced by climate change will cost the state billions in lost gross domestic product and hundreds of jobs by 2050.\Changing the \rule-making process\Wirth said there's been plenty of talk about the roles of the elected state Legislature and governor-appointed state boards in rule making. Some, like McClure, think state boards circumvent and approve rules that the Legislature has already nixed. \""People don't realize that New Mexico allows rules to be debated by elected officials in the Legislature and defeated, but still get approved by these appointed boards after hearings,"" McClure said.\Sens. Timothy M. Keller, D-Albuquerque, and Thomas C. Taylor, R-Farmington, have introduced SB 30 to clarify the rule-making process and public notification for agencies.\Some have suggested the Legislature review all rules approved by boards. Wirth called that idea unrealistic.\""We are a citizen Legislature and we are in the middle of a budget crisis,"" Wirth said. ""The idea that we could hear the issues of both sides when there's been weeks of testimony is completely unrealistic. There is a place for rule making. Attempts to legislate every single matter is just unrealistic.""\Finding a little common ground\Industry and environmental advocates agree on one thing: They want an independent office for all hearing examiners in regulatory cases. \Currently, each state agency has its own in-house hearing examiners or contracts for them. \""I think if a bill like that was introduced to establish an independent office of hearing examiners, our inclination will be to support it,"" said Douglas Meiklejohn, head of the New Mexico Environmental Law Center, which is taking Martinez to court over her decision to stop publication of the greenhouse-gas emission rules. \McClure said her organization also would support a move to a single office of hearing examiners not directly employed by the agencies considering regulations.\Contact Staci Matlock at 986-3055 or smatlock@sfnewmexican.com."

ALBUQUERQUE (AP) -- A regional official with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday commended Gov. Bill Richardson and the New Mexico Environment Department for trying to establish a greenhouse gas emissions cap and trade program.Dallas-based EPA regional administrator Al Armendariz sent a letter to the governor, praising the state for pushing forward to reduce emissions by 15 percent within 10 years, despite other parties questioning the necessity of curbing the pollution being blamed for climate change.""With the electricity generating and oil and gas sectors so important in contributions to GHG emissions, as well as being important New Mexico industries, the state's leadership in this particular rule-making is exemplary,"" Armendariz wrote.He also noted that the EPA has made action on climate change one of the agency's top seven highest priorities and that New Mexico's efforts are ""a well-reasoned and fully participatory means of arriving at effective GHG mitigation.""Armendariz's letter gives the state a shot in the arm following a two-week hearing in which critics denounced the cap and trade proposal over concerns that it will cost New Mexico's economy upward of $3.7 billion and force jobs to neighboring states while having little to no impact on a problem that is global in nature.The New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board heard on Wednesday and Thursday from economists and scientists called to testify by electric utilities, one of the industries challenging the proposal.The board is considering the state's proposal, as well as one from an environmental group that aims to curb greenhouse gas emissions from the state's largest polluters: coal-fired power plants and the oil and natural gas industry.New Mexico's power plants, refineries and other oil and gas operations pump about 24 million metric tons of carbon emissions into the air each year. The state wants to limit the emissions of those that emit 25,000 metric tons or more.Jim Norton, director of New Mexico's Environmental Protection Division, called it an honor to have support from the EPA at such a high level.""The state is really trying to do its share to address climate change, just as I think EPA is trying to do its share lacking a federal bill,"" he said.State officials say 63 facilities would fall under the proposed rule, but that number could grow, as the environment department says it would eventually look to expand the scope of sources and emissions to account for industrial, commercial and residential buildings as well as transportation fuels.Under the state's current proposal, New Mexico would be able to participate in a regional cap-and-trade program with other Western states and Canadian provinces. New Mexico would not implement the program unless there were sufficient greenhouse gas allowances to make trading efficient and cost-effective.The proposal also includes a sunset provision if the federal government were to implement its own program.Armendariz said in his letter that New Mexico's proposed program may enable participating jurisdictions to link with other cap-and-trade programs in North America, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the Northeast.Some critics of New Mexico's plan have argued that the state should let the federal government take the lead on controlling greenhouse gases so regulations are consistent across state borders.The board is expected to make a decision on the state's proposal in early November.

SANTA TERESA - An experienced engineer and adjunct professor was nominated Friday by Gov. Susana Martinez to run a state agency that has been in the spotlight recently over its plans to participate in a regional cap-and-trade program aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions.
\
F. David Martin, a New Mexico Tech adjunct associate professor, was selected as cabinet secretary of the Environment Department.
\
Martinez also named retired Col. Timothy Hale as secretary of Veterans Affairs. He commanded the 486th Expeditionary Operations Group during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
\
""As a decorated Air Force veteran and an experienced engineer, Col. Hale and Mr. Martin have the expertise it takes to help move our state forward to a more prosperous and successful future,"" the Republican governor said.
\
Martin, who holds engineering degrees from New Mexico Tech and Texas Tech, teaches in the petroleum and chemical engineering department. In 1990, he was appointed by then-Gov. Garrey Carruthers to coordinate policy between the state and the U.S. Department of Energy.
\
Martin said he looks forward to working with Martinez to ""implement commonsense policies that keep New Mexico beautiful and protect our environment while allowing for responsible development of our vast natural resources.""
\
The Environment Department oversees permitting programs for everything from power plants and mining operations to national laboratories and other industrial operators to ensure state air and water quality standards are maintained and public health is protected.
\
The department successfully petitioned a state regulatory board to adopt new rules for a regional cap-and-trade program.
\
Supporters contend the program will benefit the economy by encouraging clean energy development and help the state prepare for any potential future federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Martinez has been a vocal opponent, promising to undo the cap-and-trade program along with other rules aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in New Mexico.
\
Hale, who retired from the Air Force in 2008, heads Higher Calling Aviation Inc., which provides flight training in central New Mexico. He holds a bachelor's degree from St. Louis University and master's degrees from Webster University and from the National Defense University in Washington, D.C.
\
Hale said he was honored Martinez tasked him with ensuring that New Mexico fulfills its commitment to veterans.
\
""Our veterans put their lives on the line for their country and we owe it to them to provide the care and services they deserve,"" he said.

FARMINGTON -- A New Mexico Environment Department meeting hosted in Farmington on Wednesday to detail proposed greenhouse gas emissions rules, including a cap and trade program, drew more than 75 participants.
\
The forum was hosted as an open house, allowing participants to browse 26 posters on the wall of a San Juan College lecture hall and ask questions of six NMED staffers regarding the proposed cap and trade and industrial emissions monitoring programs.
\
The New Mexico Environment Department has proposed for power plants, generation substations and large oil and gas facilities a cap of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions with required
\
2 percent annual reductions. The proposed rule also would allow for excess emissions to be bought and sold as a commodity on an open market shared with California and two Canadian provinces pursuing similar emissions rules.
\
NMED has identified 53 sources around the state emitting more than 25,000 tons of greenhouse gasses per year that would be affected by the cap and trade rule. Farmington area community leaders say more than 60 percent of the affected sites are located in the Four Corners region.
\
The state regulatory agency also has proposed an emissions reporting rule for any industrial operation emitting more than 10,000 tons of greenhouse gasses per year, equal to the annual emissions of approximately 1,800 passenger vehicles. A version of that rule was proposed last year and drew criticism during a Farmington meeting, but action on that rule was delayed until 2010.
\
Environment Department officials said the meeting was an important tool to get localized feedback on the proposed emission rules before the regulations are heard by the Environmental Improvement Board starting Sept. 20.
\
""We think it's a really useful kind of forum for getting more specific, direct information about the proposal that's in front of the (Environmental Improvement Board) now,"" said Jim Norton, director of the NMED Environmental Protection Division. ""We really bend over backward to provide as many public involvement opportunities as we can.""
\
But many participants of the Wednesday meeting expressed frustration that posters with bullet points of the complex regulations being proposed did little to help understand the process or the state's motivation to establish new rules within the next two years. Nine of the 26 posters presented were unrelated to the proposed New Mexico rules.
\
David Wilson, owner of WIPS industrial generator sales in Aztec, said he hoped for a public presentation and question-and-answer session to hear explanations of the emissions rules that could affect his business operations.
\
""There's no tangible information here. We need tangible information,"" Wilson said. ""This stuff directly impacts me and directly affects my business. I'm looking hard for solutions.""
\
Lacking a public presentation, NMED staff were free to dodge tough questions posed by some San Juan County residents, said Darrel Clark, of Farmington.
\
""They're trying to look proactive, but if they were really proactive we would have a true question-and-answer session, instead of being walked away from like has happened to me twice so far,"" Clark said.
\
The NMED Environmental Protection Division director, however, said the open house is an ideal format that allows people to get as much detail as needed.
\
""We think there's a real advantage to having one-on-one discussions so that people can ask questions about portions of the proposal that interest them, or that they don't understand and want to have clarified,"" Norton said. ""That, we find to be really more useful than someone standing up in front of a crowd grandstanding. That doesn't really give us useful information as we're considering changes to the regulations.""
\
San Juan Economic Development Service initially voiced support for the informational hearing being held in Farmington, but after learning of the meeting's format, SJEDS Director Margaret McDaniel expressed concern that the community feedback process was superficial.
\
""This seems to be very misleading in order to say the NMED had provided an opportunity for residents in San Juan County to voice concerns,"" McDaniel said in an e-mail

LAS CRUCES - If anything was clear about a Tuesday hearing regarding proposed statewide, clean-air standards for industry, it's that there are plenty of strongly held beliefs and emotion fueling the debate.
\
A hearing officer hosted a more than six-hour session at the Farm and Ranch Heritage Museum in Las Cruces. Concerns about people's health and the future of the environment; questions about the validity of scientific research; and the possible economic impacts of implementing the rules were all raised.
\
A number of members affiliated with the Las Cruces Tea Party attended to protest the proposed new standards, considered the state's version of ""cap and trade"" rules.
\
Woody Crawford Sr. of Las Cruces, who owns a 100-rig trucking company, said he's worried about the costs of implementing the measures. It will add expense and cause companies to relocate to other states, he said.
\
""Everybody is up in arms because it's going to increase electrical bills, and we're already paying enough,"" he said.
\
Two proposals are on the table before the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board. One, put forward by state Environment Department staff, would require the larger-scale greenhouse gas emitters in New Mexico to reduce their emissions by 2 percent per year from 2012 to 2020. A second proposal, by the environmental group New Energy Economy, would require industries to reduce levels 3 percent per year for three years, also starting in 2012. Both would set benchmark years on which the reductions would be based.
\
Both proposals would allow for companies to secure ""allowances"" from other emitters that would allow them to meet the needed reduction in a given year.
\
Sandra Ely, environment and energy policy coordinator for the New Mexico Environment Department, said a key difference between the proposals is that NMED's would allow emitters to seek the offset credits from a multi-state region in both the United States and Candada that agrees to adopt the clean-air standards. And the entire proposal would only take effect if other states adopt the rules, too.
\
New Energy Economy's proposal calls for the offset credits to be secured within New Mexico only.
\
Ely noted that both differ from many proposals that have been put forward on the national level because they don't require companies to pay for each unit of greenhouse gas emissions, even those below the benchmark levels. That, she said, means it will cost much less for companies to comply, should the rules pass.
\
The Environment Department's proposal would apply to emitters of more than 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases per year - about the amount produced by 5,000 passenger vehicles - estimated to be about 63 companies in New Mexico.
\
The hearing officer, Felicia Orth, was gathering what's called ""non-technical"" testimony about the proposals. But additional technical testimony will be heard in Santa Fe, with a final decision on both proposals likely occurring in November or December.

43,"SANTA FE -- Many New Mexico companies, especially power producers and the oil and gas industry, would have to begin reducing greenhouse gas emissions or pay a price beginning in 2012 under a plan being developed by seven Western states and four Candadian provinces. \But motor vehicles, which account for a big share of the region's emissions linked to global warming, would get a pass until 2015. \The Western Climate Initiative would set caps on emissions from power plants and other industries in the seven states and four provinces involved. \Companies would be allowed to exceed their caps only by buying credits from others that have reduced their emissions more than required. The program, called ""cap and trade,"" is an attempt to enlist market forces to make greenhouse gas reductions as economical as possible. \A draft of the proposal, more than a year in the making, was unveiled in a series of meetings around the West over the last two weeks, including a gathering in Santa Fe on Friday. \The goal is a reduction in regional greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 to levels 15 percent below their 2005 levels. \The initiative has drawn cautious support from those interested in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \""The Western Climate Initiative proposal is a big step forward for an effective climate change solution,"" said Lauren Ketcham of Environment New Mexico. \The biggest complaint from industry is that the initiative is regional rather than national in scope, creating the potential for inequities and uncertainties in a national economy. \""We support and are advocates for a national approach,"" said Bruce Gantner of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association. \Many details remain to be worked out as the plan is developed over the next sev- eral years, with much still uncertain about what the final greenhouse emissions reduction approach will look like. \Regional reservation \Climate scientists say excess greenhouse gases from human activities, primarily carbon dioxide from car tailpipes and factory smokestacks, are warming Earth's climate and changing patterns of floods and droughts. In New Mexico, the scientists say, we could see substantially deeper and longer droughts in the 21st century as a result. \The Western Climate Initiative is one of a number of state-level initiatives being developed in response to a lack of federal action. \Derek Walker of the Environmental Defense Fund said the Initiative and a similar effort among states in the Northeast have a ""a huge effect politically"" by demonstrating to Congress that action on climate change has political support. \In New Mexico, coal-fired power plants are one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions, making electricity provider PNM, operator of one of the major plants, a big player in the discussion. \PNM is one of a number of companies that have banded together with environmental groups to push for a national greenhouse gas reduction system. But Jeff Burks, who works on greenhouse initiatives for the companies, said the regional approach being pursued by WCI is flawed. \The problem, he said, is the difficulty in keeping track of electricity generated inside the WCI states that is consumed inside the states. Accounting for such flows of electricity, keeping track of who is responsible for which greenhouse gas emissions, will be a difficult problem, Burks said in an interview. \Another uncertainty is how the greenhouse pollution credits will be distributed -- whether they will be given to industries for free, or sold at auction. Industry tends to support free distribution, while environmentalists favor an auction. \Concern about autos \The decision to include only industry and leave the transportation sector for later also has drawn criticism. Angus Duncan, chairman of the Oregon Global Warming Commission, said \he understands the Initiative's desire to ""chew up one mouthful and swallow it before it takes the next bite."" But Duncan said leaving emissions from cars and trucks for later will make it harder to achieve greenhouse emissions goals once the transportation sector is brought into the program. \Even among those who favor greenhouse gas reductions, a cap-and-trade proposal that does not have global reach has its detractors. \One risk, according to University of Colorado political scientist Roger Pielke Jr., is that a cap-and-trade system here in the United States, either regionally or nationally, could reduce our consumption enough to cause a corresponding global drop in the price of fossil fuels. \In response, countries like China might then increase their consumption, Pielke said, resulting in no net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. \The next step for the Western Climate Initiative is a final overall plan, which is due in September. That plan will provide the general framework for the cap-andtrade system, and then it will be up to individual states to implement detailed stateand province-level regulations. The New Mexico state Legislature is expected to take up the issue in its 2009 session."

FARMINGTON -- Following proposals to establish a ""cap and trade"" greenhouse gas emissions rule in New Mexico and other industry emissions reporting requirements, the state Environment Department is looking for feedback.
\
The state environmental regulatory agency has announced plans to host an open house-style public meeting Wednesday at San Juan College to answer questions about the proposed emissions rules, which will be considered by the state Environmental Improvement Board later this year.
\
The New Mexico Environment Department has proposed for power plants, generation substations and large oil and gas facilities a cap of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions with required annual reductions. The proposed rule also would allow for excess emissions to be bought and sold as a commodity on an open market shared with other western states pursuing similar emissions rules.
\
NMED has identified 53 sources around the state emitting more than 25,000 tons of greenhouse gasses per year that would be affected by the cap and trade rule. Farmington area community leaders say more than 60 percent of those 53 sites are located in the Four Corners region.
\
The state regulatory agency also has proposed an emissions reporting rule for any industrial operation emitting more than 10,000 tons of greenhouse gasses per year, equal to the annual emissions of approximately 1,800 passenger vehicles. A version of that rule was proposed last year and drew criticism during a Farmington meeting, but action on that rule was delayed until 2010.
\
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed emissions monitoring rules for emitters exceeding 25,000 tons per year, more than double what the state of New Mexico hopes to require, Ely said.
\
No public presentation will be made during the Wednesday meeting. Rather, those with questions will have an opportunity to speak directly with state regulators about the proposed rules.
\
""We're just traveling around the sate, just letting people know about our proposed greenhouse gas reduction rule as well as our reporting rule,"" said Sandra Ely, state environment and energy policy coordinator. ""We're hoping to educate the public on it and potentially get more input on our rule.""
\
Similar public meetings are planned for Las Cruces, Roswell and Clovis. An Albuquerque meeting was held last week.
\
Industry and area economic development groups have voiced opposition to the state's proposed emissions rules, claiming the new regulations would create an unfair burden for industry in the state, forcing many to take their businesses to neighboring states where such strict rules aren't in place.
\
However, it's good to see the state regulatory agency is bringing the conversation to Farmington before the rules are presented to the Environmental Improvement Board, said Margaret McDaniel, director of San Juan Economic Development Service.
\
""If they get (NMED) up here so we can talk to them, that's got to be a good thing,"" she said.

45,"The president and the Democratic Party have had their way. Inheriting a faltering economy, they chose to prioritize their ideology, and, after almost a year, they passed national health care in a way that rewarded drug, health-insurance and hospital companies. Political contributions were the predominant influence. \Next, they rewarded their union supporters with the rescue of GM, Chrysler and subsidies to save government employees' jobs. The other non-union 90 percent of American workers with 18 percent unemployment rate are now seen to be a political liability. The Democrats are responding, ""blame it on Bush."" What hogwash. \If you believe in socialism, tax-and-spend and believe government can create jobs, then you should vote Democrat. Flush with money from trial attorneys, public employee unions and corporations, the Democrats will soon blitz the media and hope everyone else takes their eyes off the ball. \Johnny Swift\Santa Fe\Fight back Nov. 2\I attended the congressional forum in Albuquerque Aug. 28 to hear both District 3 congressional candidates -- challenger Tom Mullins and incumbent Rep. Ben Ray Lujn. Lujn didn't show. He has reason to hide. He voted consistently with Nancy Pelosi to pass bills like Obamacare and cap and trade and other debt-increasing legislation.\Nancy said she and her lap dogs had to pass Obamacare so we'd know what's in it. Now that we do, almost 60 percent of Americans want it repealed. It doesn't cover all Americans, it's already driving up the cost of health care, and the increased cost is a reason employers aren't hiring. Cap and trade would cause huge energy-cost increases, in essence a tax on everyone, and it would impose significant regulations on homes, increasing the cost of home ownership in an already depressed market. The Senate hasn't passed this bill yet. We still have time to vote out these progressive socialists before they drag our country into a depression. \Rose Stephens\Los Alamos\Hiring Catch-22\It seems that employers who hire illegal immigrants can be fined, but the Obama administration warns that they can also be fined for asking legal immigrants to show their green card before hiring them. How do I know that they are legal if I can't ask for their green card? Duh!\The Justice Department says a valid driver's license and a Social Security card are sufficient. Not in New Mexico because illegal aliens can obtain a valid driver's license, and we see many counterfeit Social Security cards.\How about a little sanity from Congress on this one?\Bill Elliott\Santa Fe\Let 'em vend\A sign reading ""No Vending On Highway Right of Way"" recently appeared on a piece of land adjacent to the bridge over Interstate 25 at the Pecos/Glorieta entrance.

In these economic times, we should encourage entrepreneurs to find honest ways to sustain themselves and their families, not shut them down.\New Mexico prohibits vending on rights of way, but excepts ""from these prohibitions any vending-type businesses established with prior department approval on highway right of way by a federal, state or public agency providing a service to the public.""\Selling local produce and homemade crafts in these days of outsourcing provides a significant ""service to the public,"" which we should applaud, not condemn.\Doug Booth\Santa Fe\No reason needed\Regarding the Sept. 8 article, ""Secretary of State terminates 'at-will' employees"": \State agencies are authorized to hire a small number of at-will employees, exempt from the classified personnel system, who ""serve at the pleasure"" of the agency director. At-will employees serve as the agency's core management team. They're paid attractive salaries, expected to be loyal, work long hours and support the goals and initiatives of the administration. They don't have the job protection of classified employees and are typically replaced by an incoming administration. \At-will employees can be terminated at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all. If an at-will employee is disloyal, unproductive, creates chaos within the work environment affecting morale, snoops within agency records to obtain confidential information, disseminates false and misleading rumors to undermine the agency, or if he dislikes working in the agency, it's time for him to resign or be fired -- plain and simple. \Mark Valdes\Santa Fe\Prioritize spending \""The economic forecast is dire"" said State Rep. Brian Egolf, who promised to continue the fight for education at the meeting Thursday for Atalaya and Acequia Madre elementary school parents. Continued budget cuts are a huge problem for Santa Fe public schools and schools across the state. \Flooding, mold and a long history of bad construction at Agua Fra Elementary School came to light in their recent master planning process. That facility has big problems that need attention and a lot of money. \Atalaya Elementary struggles with a poorly designed and constructed facility. Problems of safety and security have been identified and the money is there to fix these issues. That work needs to be done now. \Acequia Madre has an adequate facility and the school is working well both economically and academically. Acequia Madre is not a problem.

I can stay home and draw unemployment each week, often as much as I would get working.

I still have not found a job in my field, so what am I to do? Oh wait, Brother just gave me another three months of unemployment. Guess I will look for work next week (not). If I can get something for nothing, then why work for it?\Big Brother needs to quit handing out money for doing nothing. Unions are going to cost our great grandkids for our laziness.

Many feel a federal bailout will be required, especially for those who cannot pay mortgages. If we tie requirements/incentives to those bailouts to make homes more energy efficient, we could jump-start the new green jobs economy. \8. Nuclear is unsafe and extremely expensive. If we provided the same subsidies for solar and wind as for nuclear and fossil fuels, we would already have the clean, green energy future we will now have to struggle to create. \9. One would be hard pressed to find a credible scientist who didn't agree human activity is causing climate change. We must act urgently to lessen the impact of the climate crisis. This is the single greatest threat we face. \10. Yes.

CARLSBAD -- An Eddy County lawmaker says some members of the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board involved in the proposed cap and trade regulation may have a conflict of interest and should be recused from making any decisions relating to the issue.
\
Rep. Bill Gray, R-Eddy and Otero, has sent a letter to Attorney General Gary King asking him to intervene and ""pursue all available remedies necessary"" to force the recusal of all board members who have, or appear to have, conflicts of interest with respect to the cap and trade proposals.
\
""New Mexico law and the Environment Department's own regulations protect the integrity of the proceedings such as these by requiring all members that may reasonably appear to have a conflict of interest to recuse themselves from any proceeding where such an appearance of conflict exists,"" Gray states in his letter. ""Contrary to this well-settled law, the board presiding over these proposals is replete with members who either have conflicts of interest or who appear to have conflicts of interest.""
\
Gray further adds that instead of being compromised of persons who can fairly and impartially preside over hearings and decide whether to implement either proposal, the board is stacked with members who have pre-judged issues, are paid lobbyists or are officers or directors of parties to the proceedings -- all situations that at a minimum, create the appearance of conflict of interest.
\
The state Environment Department last week held hearings in Carlsbad and Artesia to gather comments from community and business leaders ? who all spoke out against the proposals.
\
In his letter to King, Gray said the members of the board are poised to pass judgment on the cap and trade proposals in a few short months, and with the stakes so high, residents of New Mexico should be entitled to some assurances that the board ""carefully and thoughtfully"" considered the evidence presented to them in reaching a decision on the proposals.
\
Gray told King that the vast majority of the people believe the board is not fairly considering the evidence presented in on-going proceedings and that the board members have pre-determined the outcomes of both proposals.
\
""The various board members' glaring conflicts of interest reinforce these beliefs and serve only to undermine the perceived legitimacy of our government and its officials,"" Gray concluded.

FARMINGTON -- Residents offering comment during the state Environmental Improvement Board hearing in Farmington were split between opposition of proposed emissions caps fearing economic harm and support for the cap praising the improved environmental protections.
\
Dozens of residents shared opinions of the two petitions being considered by the EIB, including the cap and mandated reduction requested by the Santa Fe environmental advocacy group New Energy Economy, and a cap-and-trade program with mandated annual reductions proposed by the state Environment Department. Both proposals focus new regulation on the state's largest emitters of greenhouse gasses, including power plants and oil and gas facilities located in northwest New Mexico.
\
Most comments presented during Wednesday's seven-hour hearing were generic statements that did not address specifics of the proposed rules.
\
Residents who voiced opposition to the petitions rules frequently stated doubt of the validity of science behind global warming theories and a concern that emissions rules applied only to New Mexico will drive jobs out of the state.
\
Advocates who spoke in support of the new rules, a majority of whom were Navajo, expressed concern regarding rising levels of pollution in the Four Corners region and deteriorating public health among residents of Navajo communities.
\
Claiming more than 35 percent of state tax revenues is paid by the oil and gas industry, Farmington resident Johnny Ahlm accused the EIB of preparing to ""kill the goose that laid the golden egg"" with poorly planned regulations.
\
Ahlm, who works in the oil and gas industry, said his company would move energy jobs out of state rather than comply with the new state rules.
\
""You people need to rethink this. You're making a terrible mistake,"" Ahlm said in his comment to the EIB.
\
Other residents employed by the oil and gas industry repeatedly referenced the so-called pit rule for natural gas drilling, claiming the 2008 regulation is an example of the state overstepping its regulatory authority without ample research of the cost and benefits of the policy in San Juan County.
\
Supporters, however, cited general environmental concerns, many of which were not directly related to global warming or greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Norman Patrick Brown, of Gallup, claimed the oil and gas industry has taken resources from American Indian lands and leaving only pollution. That pollution deteriorates the traditional way of life for many Navajo living in the Four Corners, he said.
\
""A lot of my elders out there, they have no running water or electricity. That's fine for us. Our way of life requires clean air, requires pure water, requires love for our land, requires love for who we are as a people. ... This is our land, this is a part of us,"" Brown told the EIB. ""Do what you've got to do. I hope you regulate them, and I hope you do a cap and trade. Make this a message.""
\
Others who spoke in support of the emissions cap petitions asserted the new regulations will have minimal economic impact to the state, contrary to the claims of many energy industry officials. Oriana Sandoval, of Albuquerque, said the demand for ""green jobs"" is growing and such work will come to New Mexico if such greenhouse gas limits are required of the fossil fuel industries.
\
Several elected community leaders, including Farmington Mayor Tommy Roberts, Rep. James Strickler and Aztec Rep. Paul Bandy, also spoke out against the proposed emissions rules emphasizing concern that emissions limits, if adopted, will more severely affect communities in San Juan County where the energy industry is the primary economic driver.
\
""While the health of our environment is extremely important to all of us in this community, our economic health is equally important,"" Roberts said. ""It is my opinion that any proposed regulation, whether it be pro-environment or pro-industry in orientation must evidence a balanced consideration of the physical health, the environmental health and the economic health of our community.""
\
Roberts warned the proposed emissions limits would mean significant loss of employment and community tax revenues in the Farmington area.
\
EIB member Leland Gould, who works in the oil and gas industry, was the only voting member of the state board in attendance at the Farmington meeting. The Farmington meeting is last of six scheduled field hearings held in communities across the state. Comments were recorded for transcription by a hearing officer and will be presented to EIB members for review.
\
The EIB in August began its formal hearing process for the New Energy Economy petition in Santa Fe. That hearing will resume in October. The board will begin to hear technical testimony for the New Mexico Environment Department petition on Sept. 20.

Veterans beware
\
Harry Teague hasn't been truly honest with us veterans about all the things he's said he's done for us.
\
I looked up his voting record on military personal and veterans from April 4, 2009 to Aug. 10, 2010. There were 18 bills in the House pertaining to military and veterans and he voted ""no"" on six important ones like, ""Increase Health Benefits of Survivors,"" and ""Military Personal War Zone Toxic Exposure Prevention Act."" These are just a couple of examples of the important bills Teague didn't support.
\
Also from the same time period, Teague, sponsored 11 bills, for example, ""Reaching Rural Veterans through Telehealth Act"" and ""Energy Jobs for Veterans Acts."" Out of these 11 bills he sponsored, none of them were ever brought up in the House for a vote.
\
I'm a Korean veteran and I served from December 1951 - December 1955. So I would advise you as a veteran to take Teague with a grain of salt because I don't believe he's quite honest with us veterans as he claims to be.

Cap and trade
\
Recently, you printed a letter entitled ""NM cap-and-trade-legislation"" that contained the statement, ""Cap and trade is nothing but a tax scheme on the consumer and an excuse to grow big government"" that I would like to comment on. I don't think anyone wants ""big government."" Government exists to protect us from each other. That's why we have laws. And the more we want protection, the more the new laws and regulations will make government grow.
\
Now, about cap and trade, let's call it what it is - ""Pay to Pollute."" We as consumers demand products that force industry to pollute our environment (44 of the lower 48 states have consumption restrictions on fresh water fish). We can pay for that in three ways. We can force industry to limit pollution output while realizing the cost will be passed on to the consumer. But increased regulation and oversight will increase the size of government. Or we could just continue to let industry pollute at will and leave the clean up to the government. This, too, will increase the size of government and raise taxes.
\
Or we could do nothing and have our children play in the filth and pay the ultimate price from the cancer, asthma, and heart and lung diseases. You choose - while looking at your kids.

The real climate question
\
Charlie Revie (Sept. 19) thinks climate variations are controlled primarily by the sun, but in fact the geologic record shows that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases were the principal drivers of climate change over millions of years. His theory fails completely in recent times, precisely where data are most reliable: no upward trend in solar output over the last half century, yet global temperature increased markedly.
\
Mr. Revie errs again in discussing a lag of several hundred years in carbon dioxide concentration relative to temperature rise, in ages past. He neglects to mention that he is referring to circumstances at the end of an ice age, where the lag in carbon dioxide is best described by slow feedbacks initiated by orbital changes.
\
But the current global warming does not show a lag in carbon dioxide concentration relative to temperature rise. This is the crucial point. The current warming is happening under circumstances much different from an ice age, and the current rise in carbon dioxide is unquestionably of human origin. Global temperature is now responding in close agreement with the greenhouse effect, as hundreds of scientific studies have shown. Ice ages and global warming are distinctly different phenomena. The attempt to use the former to disprove the latter is a failure of logic.
\
The real question is not whether human-produced climate change is real (it almost certainly is), but whether the cost of allowing it to get worse is worth the cost of trying to stop it. This question encounters a wide spectrum of pros and cons involving economics, societal impacts, food production, long-term energy security and major ecological consequences. A complex issue indeed, and which deserves very serious consideration on the part of the present generation.

50," Governor's order takes aim at global warming\ Gases: Richardson might consider emissions cap on power plants\ Gov. Bill Richardson signed an executive order Thursday that sets high goals for the state to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.\ The order directs state agencies, including the Environment Department, to study the creation of a regional carbon trading program, a greenhouse gas reporting system and improved building codes, for example. It also aims to encourage more organic farms and the production of more ethanol and biodiesel, which are alternative fuels for cars.\ ""Climate change is the No. 1 environmental issue of our time,"" Richardson said before signing the order. ""There's nothing that poses a bigger threat to our water, our quality of life, than a warming climate.""\ A broad group of advisers from government, industry and the public gave Richardson 69 recommendations. If all of them were mandatory or achieved, New Mexico would reduce greenhouse gases by 267 million metric tons from 2007-2013, and save an estimated $2 billion through energy efficiency.\ Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that's produced when fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline are burned.\ Many scientists agree that too many greenhouse gases can harm the environment by trapping heat in the atmosphere and altering weather patterns and crop production in negative ways.\ Richardson also said he would consider pushing a state law that would limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and oil refineries, similar to legislation recently signed by California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. ""We're considering it,"" Richardson said. ""Our plan is not developed.""\ That proposal would be subject to approval by the Legislature, which meets next month for a 60-day session.\ Overall, the state's largest utility company is supportive of Richardson's initiatives, said Marc Christensen, communications director for Public Service Company of New Mexico. ""Of course, from our point of view, we really want to focus on the aspects of energy efficiency,"" Christensen said.\ When asked about PNM's position on a potential law limiting greenhouse gases like California's, Christensen said his company would support a national program. ""We really prefer a national cap and trade system,"" he said, ""and we think that only ... a system that works on the national level can be cost effective and efficient.""\ That way, he explained, different states don't adopt different rules.\ A cap and trade system is a system where emissions are capped but companies can buy and sell permits, the Union of Concerned Scientists explained on its Web site. For example, some companies may pollute more than the limit and would need to buy more permits. Companies that polluted less than the limit could sell extra permits to others.\ Environment Secretary Ron Curry said the top three greenhouse gas producers are coal-fired power plants; the production side of the oil and gas industry, which drills for those resources in New Mexico; and the state's transportation sector.\ The recommendations were produced by the New Mexico Climate Change Advisory Group, which has produced a report on the issue.\ It offers details, for example, as to why organic farms can reduce greenhouse gases. Organic farms have higher levels of soil carbon, which helps keep carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the report says. And less chemicals used on that farm means less chemical production, which makes greenhouse gases as a byproduct.\ The report also suggests consumers buy more food that is produced in the state. Just\ 3 percent of the food eaten in the state is produced locally today, according to the report, and much of that is dairy products.\ Contact Andy Lenderman at 995-3827 or alenderman@sfnewmexican.com."
51,"Little more than a change in title separates the border between New Mexico and Colorado north of Farmington. The landscape remains an expanse of low, brown hills spotted with stout juniper trees. Untamed Siberian elms burgeon along La Plata River, which runs between the two states. Oil rigs speckle both horizons, and, floating unseen in the air above, is a cloud of methane the size of Delaware. \The biggest change that occurs at the state line is in the policies that govern the air pollution both states share. North of the border, Colorado has one of the nation's most rigorous laws for the oil and gas industry to limit methane emissions, rules that the federal government -- under the Obama administration -- and other states used as the gold standard on which to model their own regulations. \But for wells operated south of the state line, there are zero state-level requirements on the amount of methane they can release into the environment. While New Mexico does require companies to report the amount of gases vented or flared into the atmosphere from their wells, producers have been slow to comply, and penalties are negligible, state documents show. \""You don't just turn on the faucet and keep it running,"" said Gwen Lachelt, director of the Western Leaders Network, a nonprofit aimed at uniting local policymakers in Western states. ""Nobody does that, except New Mexico, and now the federal government -- who say the oil and gas companies can pollute the air and diminish our natural resources."" \Methane is considered a distant second to carbon dioxide as a contributor to global warming. It is far more potent, however, trapping over 20 times more heat in Earth's atmosphere in the first 20 years after it is released than carbon dioxide, according to the EPA. \Under former President Barack Obama's administration, two sets of regulations were established by the federal Bureau of Land Management and the Environmental Protection Agency that, together, required companies on private, state, federal and tribal land to limit methane emissions and install leak-detection monitors. The rules would have required oil and gas companies in all states to comply with methane requirements similar to Colorado's beginning in June and would have helped the U.S. meet its obligations to limit greenhouse gas emissions under the international Paris climate accord. \The implementation of these regulations also might have helped the nation better document specific sources of methane emissions. \But President Donald Trump's administration has embarked on an aggressive rollback of federal environmental regulations, not only withdrawing from the climate agreement, but suspending the requirements for companies to comply with the BLM and EPA methane rules until pending litigation has been resolved and reviews and revisions of the rules have been completed -- a process expected to last at least two years. \The Trump administration's actions have launched a series of federal lawsuits. On \July 2, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \District of Columbia ruled that the administration could not enact a 90-day stay on the EPA's methane regulation, already in effect, while conducting a review of the rule. While the agency had the right to review the rule, the court said, it could not postpone the date for the regulation to come into effect -- and for companies to become compliant with the rule -- while that review was underway. \The court is separately considering the EPA's proposal to delay the rule's effective date, not just 90 days but two years. \This month, a number of parties, including New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas and environmental groups such as the Sierra Club, filed a suit against the U.S. Department of the Interior, challenging its authority to stay the BLM's methane rule. \Trump's rollback efforts are putting more responsibility on states to regulate methane and other greenhouse gases. \In New Mexico, the regulatory environment has become crucial, with more than $13 billion invested in the last six months in the Permian Basin, which straddles Southern New Mexico and Texas. Environmentalists fear the consequences of this impending drilling, without any regulations to limit methane emissions, could be catastrophic. \How Colorado and New Mexico's differing policies are impacting the amount of methane leaking into the air from oil and gas production is hard to know. Federal laws do not require individual oil and gas wells to report methane emissions, so data on emissions per well, state to state, do not exist. \Even if these measures were reported, the amount of methane produced by each state would have to be compared with the amount of oil and gas extracted that year, because emissions inherently fluctuate with production levels. \But between 2011 and 2015, collective methane emissions reported for both states -- including from power plants, refineries, minerals, waste and other sources -- dropped by 1.5 million tons per year in Colorado, a 30 percent decrease, while rising 0.6 million tons in New Mexico, a 38 percent increase. \Jon Goldstein of the Environmental Defense Fund said using such measures to understand emissions is problematic, because they exclude both small sources of emissions, like individual wells, and ""super emitters"" -- wells that leak a large amount of gas. \Still, he said, ""New Mexico would benefit greatly from sensible methane waste and pollution requirements like Colorado has put in place."" Such rules would reduce pollution, improve public health and boost the economy, he added. \""With the great deal of uncertainty that is going on at the federal level, it makes sense for states like New Mexico to step forward and create certainty,"" Goldstein said. \States lead climate action \Since 2014, 13 states, in addition to Colorado, have adopted methane-capture or leak-detection regulations to limit methane in the environment. California adopted the nation's most aggressive methane regulations in May, and policies have been crafted in New York and Pennsylvania since the federal rollbacks began. In addition, 12 states have joined a climate alliance, committing them to remain in the Paris climate agreement and strive to lower greenhouse gas emissions at the local level. \At least 274 mayors have signed on at the city level, including Santa Fe Mayor Javier Gonzales. \New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, who has received more than $1 million from the oil and gas industry in campaign contributions since 2010, mostly has kept silent on climate change and problems regarding methane emissions. But earlier this year, she wrote to the House of Representatives, asking for a repeal of the BLM's methane rule using the Congressional Review Act. She said the costs for companies to comply would hurt the state and its schoolchildren, who rely on oil and gas royalties, in part, to fund public education. \Martinez has declined to answer a number of questions regarding her stance on whether the state should have its own methane regulations to offset a lack of federal policy. A spokesman for her office simply said her letter asking Congress to repeal the law was not related to campaign contributions. He referred further questions to the state's energy and environment departments. \Before Martinez took office in 2011, New Mexico was one of the states leading the charge on climate action. But since then, she has shifted New Mexico's climate-change and greenhouse gas monitoring policies significantly. \""Elections matter when it comes to the environment,"" said Lachelt, with the Western Leaders Network. Before she started the nonprofit, Lachelt served as a county commissioner in Colorado's La Plata County, which shares the largest portion of the methane cloud with New Mexico. \She worked with Democrat Bill Richardson on climate policies when he was governor of New Mexico. Methane regulations don't need to be partisan, she said, but Martinez's agenda is ""very in line with the oil and gas industry."" \""Susana Martinez was elected and just slowly began eroding the great policies we put in place or simply left things unenforced,"" Lachelt said. \New Mexico policies \In 2005, then-Gov. Richardson issued an executive order for New Mexico to take action on climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. He said the state was committed to joining other states, specifically California and then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, in ""assuming a leadership role in addressing the risks of climate change."" \Richardson said the state would reduce its emissions of methane 20 percent by 2020. He established the Climate Change Action Council, to be led by the state's environment and energy departments, and the New Mexico Climate Change Advisory Group to help the state reach an ultimate goal of lowering all greenhouse gas emissions 75 percent below 2000 levels by 2050. \Under Richardson, the state Environmental Improvement Board approved regulations on greenhouse gas reporting, a greenhouse gas reduction program and cap-and-trade program. \The state encouraged oil and gas companies to enroll in a voluntary methane-reduction program through the EPA, called Gas STAR, and said more than \70 percent of companies operating in the state were enrolled as of 2007. \But within her first year as governor, Martinez appointed new members to the Environmental Improvement Board, and the revamped panel repealed all of Richardson's climate and emissions rules; his climate action committees went defunct. \In 2016, the Environmental Improvement Board went further, repealing part of New Mexico's 1978 air quality regulations, which were intended ""to minimize emissions from petroleum or natural gas processing facilities."" The board said the regulations were redundant. \Only 10 natural gas producers out of more than 600 operating in New Mexico are still voluntarily complying, according to EPA data and the Western Environmental Law Center. \Still, the state says emissions have gone down. \Beth Wojahn, a spokeswoman with the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, said in an email, ""The Department is dedicated to protecting our natural resources while helping our economy grow and thrive. We've worked with stakeholders to improve New Mexico's oversight of venting in a way that both protects our economy and creates jobs."" \From May 2016, when the plan went into effect, to May 2017, she said, the amount of methane flared compared to total production was reduced to 0.89 percent from 1.5 percent, and the amount of gas flared was reduced by more than 10 billion cubic feet per day. \An inventory of New Mexico's greenhouse gas emissions published in December 2016 also found that emissions in the state decreased between 2000 and 2013. \But these reductions were ""likely a result of reduced production in response to lower gas prices and decreases in total natural gas and condensate wells count since 2010,"" the report said. \The state lost 10,000 natural gas and condensate wells between 2000 and 2011, the report said, which accounted for lower methane levels. \But how much released methane the state effectively tracks is unclear. \State air quality monitored by the New Mexico Environment Department is based on compliance with a 1995 regulation, which only requires reporting from large emitters -- companies that release more than 100 tons per year of air pollution or 10 tons per year of hazardous air pollutants, like mercury or lead. The rule does not set specific emissions limits for individual oil and gas operators. \Air quality monitors in the state track nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter -- but not methane. \In 2016, the state Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department's Oil Conservation Division began requiring companies to submit a gas-capture plan. But as of March 2017, only 51 operators out of 603 were complying with reporting requirements, according to a news release signed by David Catanach, director of the Oil Conservation Division. \The gas-capture plan, which came into effect in January 2016, is a two-page form that asks for well location, the amount of gas produced and the amount flared or vented. The document says it is intended to limit venting and flaring of operators, but it does not set limits on how much gas can be vented or flared. \Gov. Martinez declined through a spokesperson to comment on her position on methane regulations and said the comments made by the state energy department fully reflected the administration's position. \When asked by The New Mexican about state-level climate action, she said, ""the issues are being dealt with"" and that the state has ""measures in place"" to address climate change. \She was referring to the state's 2015 Energy Plan. \That 48-page document makes no mention of climate change and just one mention of greenhouse gases, but only in reference to the EPA rules for carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. \Allison Majure, a spokeswoman for the state Environment Department, declined multiple requests to answer questions about the state's air quality regulations, saying she had hundreds of emails she needed to address first. \Colorado policies \Colorado's methane regulations are still relatively new, but state officials are optimistic that they are working to improve air quality. \In 2014, the state finished a yearlong rule-making process to bring parts of the state into compliance with federal ozone requirements. \Jeremy Neustifter, air quality planner and spokesman for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said methane reduction was the added benefit of that policy. \""We are trying to clean up the air in the Denver area and reduce the ozone,"" he said. ""And as a co-benefit, we got a pretty large reduction of methane."" \The regulations include limiting emissions from existing petroleum storage tanks; adding gas-capture devices to those tanks; requiring leak detection; repairing existing wells and compressor facilities; adding flare-control devices and requiring that gas streams be connected to a pipeline. \Based on a two-year pilot project conducted by Colorado to determine the rule's impact, the number of leaking oil and gas facilities fell by 75 percent between July 2013 and June 2015, Neustifter said, adding that the industry was very involved in creating the rule. \Colorado says the cost to the oil and gas industry is negated by the benefits. \According to a state-produced cost-benefit analysis in 2014, the industry would see a $42.5 million annual cost, with a one-time cost of $2 million to fix existing leaks in wells. But, the analysis said, there would be a reduction of about 93,500 tons per year of volatile organic compounds, which contain carcinogenic chemicals and build ozone, and a reduction of 65,000 tons per year in methane and ethane emissions. \The industry's costs average about $453 per ton of reduced volatile organic compounds, the document said. Neustifter said the costs would have to exceed $5,000 per ton to outweigh the benefits. \Advocates of methane regulations say complying with requirements to limit emissions will increase companies' profits. They say the methane captured by fixing leaks and limiting venting practices can be resold on the market, allowing companies to make more money, which would, in turn, increase royalties and taxes that states collect from mineral extraction on state and federal land. \Opponents of methane rules say the cost of compliance would hurt profits. \In 2014, Colorado's oil and gas industry generated $15.8 billion, according to the Colorado Oil and Gas Association. That means the industry's total cost for leak controls was far less than 1 percent of its profits that year. \But Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, an industry group that has been a vocal opponent of the federal methane regulations and is involved in litigation, said New Mexico's gas capture plan is ""more collaborative with industry"" and more cost-effective for the industry than Colorado's. \""The beauty of states is there are \50 different laboratories,"" she said. ""So what has worked in Colorado may or may not work in North Dakota or New Mexico."" \The industry is already incentivized to capture methane, she said, and has been effectively self-regulating and reducing emissions without regulation. \""The leak-detection repair approach that Colorado has taken results in very high costs for very low additional methane capture,"" Sgamma said, ""and when costs are so out of proportion with the environmental benefits, then you put at risk job creation and economic growth needlessly."" \This is a key argument of the oil and gas industry in New Mexico and across the nation. But advocates of methane regulations say Colorado's policies have created job growth, rather than loss. \Colorado says it doesn't have data to definitively prove either argument yet. \""There are many variables that affect how an oil and gas company performs financially, such as the price of oil and natural gas,"" Neustifter said. \The state does not have more information on profit analysis since the cost-benefit analysis report, he said. \The Colorado Oil and Gas Association also hasn't released a profit statement since 2015. \In February, U.S. Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., asked Jack Gerard, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, if he could provide evidence that methane regulations would contribute or have contributed to job losses, based on existing regulations in Colorado and Wyoming. Gerard was not able to provide evidence at the hearing. \""There's no evidence that there has been any job loss in Colorado as a result of Regulation 7, and also, the Colorado Business Review in 2016 took a look at this issue and found that there wasn't any job loss,"" Udall, who supports the federal methane regulations, told Gerard. \The Environmental Defense Fund, a supporter of methane research, has funded studies that show leak-capturing requirements have created jobs specific to the work of finding and fixing methane leaks. \Other research points out that capturing methane does lead to increased profits. \The EPA's Natural Gas STAR program, after a decade of companies voluntarily complying to reduce methane, found in 2016 that installing devices that lower the bleed rate of pressurized natural gas valves (part of Colorado's rule) would save between 50 million cubic feet and 260 million cubic feet of natural gas each year. \The report said partners in the program had collectively saved $254.8 million worth of gas by installing the devices. \Contact Rebecca Moss at 505-986-3011 \or rmoss@sfnewmexican.com.\Credit: Rebecca Moss The New Mexican"

This week's column involves global climate change and a proposed cap-and-trade program, but it's not really about that.
\
Rather, it is about good government and whether sweeping changes that would impact every resident and business in the state should be made by elected officials who are accountable to the voters, or by a small, appointed board.
\
In Washington, D.C., a federal cap-and-trade bill passed in the House of Representatives on June 26, 2009, but has languished in the Senate ever since, and will die at the end of the session if no action is taken. Should that happen, it would be a huge disappointment to those who believe climate change is an existential threat, and worked so hard to get a bill through the House.
\
But, it would also likely reflect the will of the majority. And, if voters are upset, they can elect new members to ensure that the bill gets through next time.
\
In New Mexico, we don't have to fuss with the messy process of legislation. Instead, we have delegated this issue to the Environmental Improvement Board - a seven-member body appointed by the governor. On the current board, five members are from Santa Fe, one is from Albuquerque and one, Abbas Ghassemi, is from Las Cruces.
\
The board is responsible for ""the promulgation of rules and standards"" for, among other things, food protection, water supply, liquid waste, air quality management, radiation control, occupational health and safety, hazardous waste and solid waste.
\
No small feat for a board that typically meets once a month.
\
Earlier this month, the board meet in Las Cruces to consider two proposals regulating large-scale greenhouse gas emitters in New Mexico. Like all cap-and-trade bills, both would allow those that fall short of meeting the proposed requirement to purchase allowances from those that exceed the standard.
\
A final decision is expected in November or December. Which is convenient, because, while Gov. Bill Richardson is a strong supporter of state emissions standards, the candidates running to replace him - Democrat Diane Denish and Republican Susana Martinez - are both vehemently opposed.
\
Meanwhile, the State Environment Department is proposing sweeping new regulation for about 700 miles of rivers and streams, 29 lakes and more than 4,900 acres of wetlands in a dozen wilderness areas. An amendment would add another 800 miles of waterways.
\
It is something Richardson has been pushing for since 2008. Last week the Supreme Court gave its approval for hearings to begin.
\
I'm not questioning the merits of either proposal. I'm all for clean air and water. But I do question whether such important changes should be made by appointed boards in the final months of a lame-duck administration.

While I tend to lean toward one party, I like to vote on the individual candidates so I went to last Tuesday's Carlsbad candidate's forum -- and walked out with a clear answer.
\
In a rough economic environment, Harry Teague made a strong case: he has directed funds toward our district, created hundreds of jobs at WIPP and is helping New Mexico move toward the energy of the future with the CEHMM biofuels facility. Perhaps most importantly, he was instrumental in passing Katie's Law.
\
The kicker, though, was when Steve Pearce had to reach back to when he was a state legislator to come up with something constructive he had done on education, and even that was pretty flimsy -- inviting high-schoolers to learn how the legislature worked. Yikes.
\
Pearce continued the GOP vilification of what was a GOP idea before they had to oppose it because it was in Democratic legislation: cap and trade, a smart, market-based solution to a crisis Pearce pretends doesn't exist. Independent economists say the cost burden to consumers would be much smaller than Pearce tries to scare us into thinking.
\
And while climate legislation would move America toward energy independence and create jobs, it would also help do a much more important job: save our kids and grandkids.
\
Teague 3, Pearce 0. Decision made.

54," New Mexico is the first state to sign up with the Chicago Climate Exchange, an organization that harnesses market forces to the goal of reducing the greenhouse gases linked to global warming.\ CCX members, including IBM, Motorola, DuPont and the cities of Boulder and Portland, Ore., agree to cut emissions by 4 percent -- and to buy credits to cover the gap if they can't achieve the goal.\ New Mexico can't this year unless it can add 9,000 metric tons to the 2,000 tons of reductions already achieved. Environment Department Secretary Ron Curry estimates his Air Quality Division will have to buy from $30,000 to $50,000 worth of credits.\ Savings so far have been racked up in direct energy use -- natural gas for heating a state building or fuel for state vehicles. Phase two of the program, which the state has not yet undertaken, entails indirect use -- the light switch in Curry's Santa Fe office that eventually connects with a coal-fired generating plant in northwestern New Mexico.\ Power plants are the No. 1 source of carbon dioxide in New Mexico. The reduction goals and requirement to buy credits make players in the cap-and-trade game mindful of such out-of-sight plants.\ The incentives are more direct for business members of the climate exchange, which have to make money, than for governments. But quantifying conservation in terms of dollars and cents creates budgetary pressures that will keep managers' attention more focused on the goal than a forest's worth of wellintentioned memos.\ Two thousand metric tons of anything, much less something in a gaseous state, seems like a lot. But it's just the first step toward reducing state government's share of the problem by 4 percent. It's also a step toward ""do as I do"" leadership that reinforces ""do as I say"" regulation."

My magic wand is on the fritz, otherwise we'd have a big, new federal program to free America from its dependence on oil. Like other environmentalists, I'm sad that the calamity in the Gulf of Mexico hasn't spurred Washington to more vigorously promote America's exit from this curse.
\
The fault may lie with President Obama's timidity, a public scared by major new government programs or fossil-fuel interests flashing their campaign dough. Probably it's all three, but the bottom line is this: An all-out effort to unchain America from hydrocarbons is essential to national security, a healthy environment and economic prosperity in the 21st century. But it's not politically possible.
\
And so we must look at what's passable. Fortunately, there's one piece to the escape strategy that business leaders, military brass and the buying public all like -- and would create jobs. Most importantly, it has bipartisan support in Congress.
\
We speak of electric cars, specifically the ""Electric Vehicle Deployment Act of 2010."" Sponsored by Sens. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., the bill's goal is to electrify half of America's cars and trucks within 20 years. That, its backers say, would cut America's dependence on petroleum by a third. Similar legislation is before the House.
\
The Senate bill would name at least five communities to be models for electric-vehicle transportation. They would build stations where motorists could recharge their cars' batteries. Residents would be offered a $10,000 tax credit to buy electric cars. And the federal government would put $1.5 billion into research for improving electric-car technology.
\
Electric cars don't appear to be a very hard sell to those who would buy them. The first all-electric model, the Nissan Leaf, will hit the U.S. market at the end of the year. (The batteries will be made in Smyrna, Tenn.) But you won't be able to just pick one up, because the year's production is already sold out. More than two-thirds of the 19,000 preorders are from the United States.
\
The Chevy Volt will reach showrooms around that time. Its battery range of 40 miles is considerably smaller than the Nissan Leaf's 100 miles, but the Volt has a small gasoline engine to keep the car going if a recharging station is not handy.
\
In any case, more than 75 percent of Americans commute 40 miles or less a day. That means most of them could plug in their Volts at the end of the day and drive off fully charged in the morning.
\
Being both an environmentalist and a fan of high automotive performance can be awkward. But car makers are learning to put zoom into their fuel-efficient models. The Ford Fusion Hybrid, for example, gets 41 miles-a-gallon in the city, but can pull away from a stoplight at a respectable pace. ""Sustainable mobility solutions"" need not be as boring as they sound.
\
What about the source of the electric power? Although an all-electric vehicle puts out zero emissions, that is probably not true of the plant that provides the electricity. While California has moved its mix of electricity sources toward clean, renewable energy, other parts of America are still highly dependent on dirty, coal-powered plants.
\
However, electric cars cut global warming pollution even where coal supplies the power, according to a study by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash. That's because cars plugged in overnight employ unused capacity in the current electric system.
\
So let the brawl over cap-and-trade proceed. Outside of the oil business, most everyone seems enthusiastic about accelerating a move toward electric cars. Nothing should stop Congress from revving up the process. Right?

SANTA FE Environmentalists were celebrating and a lot of energy companies were grumbling after the Obama administration rolled out new Environmental Protection Agency regulations on Monday but New Mexico's largest utility company was taking a wait-and-see attitude.
\
Saying that the EPA draft rule ""is a lengthy and complex document,"" Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) senior vice president of public policy Ron Darnell said in a statement that ""it's too early to tell how it will affect PNM specifically.""
\
Or, how much extra it will cost PNM customers.
\
The new EPA rules will set national guidelines on carbon dioxide on existing power plants for the first time, aiming to reduce CO2 emissions 30 percent nationwide.
\
One of the primary targets of the new regulations is the coal industry.
\
PNM's San Juan Generating Station in the northwest corner of New Mexico contains four coal-fired generating units and the company has put forth a proposal to retire two of the coal units as a way to reduce regional haze. The other two units plan to be retrofitted with pollution controls.
\
Since the PNM plan, which received non-binding approval last year from the EPA and the New Mexico Environment Department, aims to reduce emissions 50 percent, PNM officials have been guardedly optimistic that Monday's announcement will not effect the San Juan proposal.
\
""We appreciate that the EPA rule provides each state with significant flexibility in developing a compliance plan that recognizes unique opportunities and challenges,"" Darnell said.
\
The San Juan plan still has to be approved by the Public Regulation Commission as well as the EPA.
\
With or without the new EPA regulations, PNM customers were going to pay more.
\
In early 2013, PNM estimated its proposal would cost the company between $400 million and $430 million. Judging from rough estimates made at the time, the plan would cost PNM customers a little more than $30 more per year.
\
""On the one hand, I'm pleased that (New Mexico appears) to be well positioned,"" New Mexico Environment Secretary Ray Flynn told Associated Press. ""On the other hand, I still remain concerned about impacts to consumers. There's no question that EPA's action is going to result in increased costs for electric generation around the country.""
\
Nationally, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce claimed the EPA regulations could cost up to $50 billion a year in GDP and keep 224,000 jobs a year from being created.
\
""Sure, energy companies are going to howl, but they can't get a free pass to dump harmful waste into our air any longer, and they're fully capable of innovating their way to solutions,"" said National Audubon Society president and CEO David Yarnold.
\
The EPA says the regulations will save 6,600 lives and more than $50 billion a year in health care costs tied to air pollution.
\
Both of New Mexico's U.S. senators, Martin Heinrich and Tom Udall, hailed the decision.
\
""Climate change is a fact that is a problem in New Mexico today and not just at some far off date in the future,"" Heinrich said. ""The longer we wait to act, the more difficult and expensive the solutions will be and the more unpredictable our weather will become.""
\
But the only Republican in the New Mexico Capitol Hill delegation blasted the new regulations.
\
""The president and the EPA are using these regulations to force states into using cap-and-trade systems that could not even pass in the Senate with a filibuster-proof Democratic majority,"" said Rep. Steve Pearce, R-New Mexico. ""The administration's radical war on coal is nothing more than a war on the poor.""

ALBUQUERQUE - Closing arguments have been made, and now it's up to New Mexico regulators to decide whether to adopt more rules aimed at capping greenhouse gas emissions across the state.
\
The New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board on Dec. 6 will consider a petition from nonprofit group New Energy Economy that would force large polluters such as power plants and refineries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 3 percent per year from 2010 levels. The petition was the focus earlier this year of days of public hearings and expert testimony.
\
Critics contend New Mexico businesses and electric ratepayers would end up footing the bill for the new regulations, but supporters argue the economic impact would actually be positive and a limit on the amount companies would be required to spend to reduce emissions would help control costs.
\
""The record demonstrates that there is a considerable 'upside' to placing a price on carbon it will create jobs and spur innovation,"" New Energy Economy states in closing arguments filed with the board this week.
\
The group is optimistic its plan will be approved because the board earlier this month voted to adopt new regulations proposed by the state Environment Department that would allow New Mexico to participate in a regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program.
\
""The board made clear that it believes climate change is real,"" said Bruce Frederick, an attorney with the New Mexico Environmental Law Center, which filed the petition on behalf of New Energy Economy.
\
New Energy Economy contends its plan would allow New Mexico to move forward with controlling emissions since the state's cap-and-trade program hinges on having enough pollution allowances within the region to make the program efficient and cost effective.
\
Like the state's program, New Energy Economy's proposal would apply to electricity generators and other facilities that emit at least 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. The NEE plan also includes provisions for offsets and banking of emissions credits from other sources not covered by the proposed rules.
\
""Our plan is a state-only program, it's less complicated, it's not contingent on third parties, and it won't be subject to as many challenges as the state program,"" Frederick said.
\
The debate over state regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been brewing for more than a year, with supporters arguing that New Mexico should act because federal legislation addressing carbon emissions and climate change has stalled.
\
New Mexico utilities, industry groups and some state lawmakers have argued that a New Mexico-only emissions cap would not solve what they consider to be a global problem. They also contend that a cap applying only to New Mexico would put the state at a disadvantage and lead to higher costs for residents.
\
Even if the board were to approve New Energy Economy's petition, the fate of those regulations and the state's cap-and-trade program remain uncertain. Some critics are considering legal action and others say it's possible for Gov.-elect Susana Martinez and legislators to rollback the rules.

SILVER CITY - Former U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce said at a town hall meeting Thursday that if the country could get economic growth going again, it would solve a multitude of other problems, such as Social Security's uncertain future.
\
""And the way we create economic growth is to create jobs,"" Pearce said before an audience of about 100 area residents.
\
Pearce, a Republican from Hobbs, is running against Harry Teague, a Democrat, for the District 2 seat from New Mexico. Teague took over the post after Pearce left to unsuccessfully run for the U.S. Senate in 2008.
\
Pearce said the challenge to job creation at this time lies with the current administration and the Democratically-lead Congress.
\
""Our government has a war on jobs right now,"" Pearce said. ""They are killing jobs through over-regulation and tax uncertainties.""
\
He said he wasn't in favor of complete de-regulation but a middle ground must be met when addressing the protection of the environment.
\
""I'm not in favor of clear-cutting our forests,"" Pearce said. ""I think BP should be held responsible for what they did. But we shouldn't kill jobs over it like the administration is doing.""
\
His mantra throughout the meeting was that ""tax cuts create jobs, tax increases kill jobs.""
\
Audience members asked several questions, including on cap and trade, which Pearce said would be harmful to the economy and would do nothing to protect the environment.
\
""Europe is losing jobs because of this policy,"" Pearce said. ""This would be very detrimental to our economy.""
\
Pearce said the current administration and Congress are caught up in the ""progressive movement.""
\
""They believe we have too much and they want to downgrade our standard of living to the rest of the world's standards,"" Pearce said. ""We need to 'average up' the rest of the world to our standards.""
\
Pearce said a major source of job creation would be through relaxing regulations so the manufacturing industry would return to the United States.
\
Pearce said he was in favor of free trade but only if free trade agreements were fair.
\
""But right now we are having a harder time sending our goods to other countries and they are having an easier time sending their goods to us,"" Pearce said.
\
He said the country needed to crack down on China over intellectual property rights to the point of imposing sanctions on China if necessary.
\
""They (China) are abusing our relationship,"" Pearce said. ""China needs to play by the rules.""
\
Pearce said he would push for ""virtual government"" through the Internet that would get more citizens involved and keep them engaged. He said if members of the Congress and the Senate knew they were being monitored more closely by constituents at home, it would cut down on the ""hypocrisy.""
\
He said he wasn't sure that any particular department of government needed to be cut but they should be made more competitive and more efficient.
\
""We put more money toward these departments and they just hire more people,"" Pearce said. ""But we are paying for services that we aren't getting.""

"
63," New Mexico industries will be required to start reporting their greenhouse gas emissions, beginning in 2009, to the state Environment Department, under a rule recently ordered by the state Environment Improvement Board.\ The rule, which includes oil and gas producers, mandates the most comprehensive reporting in the nation, said Jim Norton, director of the Environmental Protection Division of the Environment Department.\ Wisconsin and New Jersey have greenhouse gas reporting rules, but they are narrower in scope. California has prepared a similar rule but has not yet adopted it, Norton said.\ The rule requires industries that already report emissions of other air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, to include greenhouse gas emissions in their reports.\ It will allow a phasing in of the greenhouse gases being reported, starting with carbon dioxide, followed by methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. A schedule for the phase-in will be released next year, Norton said.\ Industry representatives had differing reactions to the rule. Public Service Company of New Mexico spokeswoman Susan Sponar said PNM supports the new reporting requirements.\ ""PNM already reports the greenhouse gas emissions from our power plants to the Environmental Protection Agency. The only difference now will be that we will have to report the greenhouse gas emissions from our natural gas delivery operations to the state,"" she said.\ But Bob Gallagher, president of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, said the industry was blindsided by the part of the rule that applies to emissions from small sources in the oil and gas industry, such as on-site generators and small natural-gas compressors at drilling sites.\ ""There are not even protocols for how you would measure emissions from small sources. The Environment Department staff presented a timetable for developing those protocols to the EIB, and they turned it down. They insisted the protocols be written 'now,' '' he said.\ Norton confirmed that, at the EIB's direction, the department's staff will require reports of emissions from small sources in the oil and gas industry a year earlier than originally planned, and that the staff will speed up its development of protocols for measuring those releases.\ Both Sponar and Gallagher said that, for those sites that already report emissions, the new program should not add significant costs. Gallagher said it is unclear how much the program might cost small- source sites, because the protocols haven't been developed.\ Environment Department spokeswoman Marissa Stone said no one has filed an appeal of the rule.\ Norton said current plans call for large industrial facilities to report their 2008 emissions of carbon dioxide in early 2009. In 2010, they will report 2009 emissions of carbon dioxide and methane, and, in 2011, they will report emissions of all six chemicals.\ Smaller industries will have a slightly more extended reporting schedule, reporting 2009 carbon dioxide emissions in 2010, then 2010 carbon dioxide and methane emissions in 2011. As yet, no date has been set for when smaller industries will begin reporting emissions of all six chemicals, he said.\ Norton added that the reports might eventually form the basis for a cap and trade system, under which industries could sell or trade permits for prescribed amounts of greenhouse gas emissions.\ Gallagher blamed the EIB's decision to speed up the reporting requirements for small oil and gas sources on testimony from what he called, ""out-of-state, paid obstructionists."" Among these, he said, were the Oil and Gas Accountability Project of Durango, Colo., and the Western Environmental Law Center, which has offices throughout the West.\ ""The oil and gas industry has been a willing participant in this process from the beginning, but it's frustrating to sit at an EIB meeting and watch out-ofstate paid obstructionist groups attempt to affect how we live in New Mexico,"" Gallagher said.\ Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, an attorney for the Western Environmental Law Center, who lives in Taos, said Gallagher was incorrect on two points.\ ""There are wellestablished quantification methodologies for nearly all oil and gas emissions. They've been established by the American Petroleum Institute. Also, everyone who was involved in this case lives in New Mexico,"" he said.\ The rule is a result of a process started by Gov. Bill Richardson in 2005, when he formed an advisory group on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Norton said.\ Richardson said, in a recent statement, that the reporting program is essential to the state's effort to address climate change."
64,"Martinez, Denish speak out on emissions, water\By Staci Matlock\The New Mexican\Neither of New Mexico's gubernatorial candidates -- Democrat Diane Denish and Republican Susana Martinez -- are likely to put environmental issues quite as high on their agenda as Gov. Bill Richardson.\They've already indicated they might overturn or weaken some environmental rules Richardson's administration has put in place, such as the pit rule for wastes from oil and gas production and the greenhouse gas emissions cap.\A governor can do a lot to upend or change environmental rules and orders approved under a predecessor. She can appoint her own people to commissions, direct those commissions to revisit rules and direct staff to ignore existing rules.\""There could be rollbacks of \environmental regulations after the elections happen,"" said Jim Norton, director of the environmental protection division at the New Mexico Environment Department.\Denish at least has environment and energy listed as issues on her campaign website and provides a list of ""six environmental principles to lead by"" on her site and promotes the creation of ""sustainable jobs.""\Environment, water and energy were not ""issues"" topics listed on Martinez's official campaign website.\Follow the money\Thus far, oil and gas companies have been top industry donors to the Martinez campaign, giving her $481,125. Also among her major financial supporters are homebuilders ($462,801) and conservative issue groups ($250,000), according to followthemoney.org. Texas homebuilder Bob J. Perry, who funded the Swiftboat ad campaign against unsuccessful Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry, gave her $350,000 in May.\Denish also has received money from the oil and gas industry ($71,400), much of it from companies in her hometown of Hobbs, in an area sometimes referred to as ""Little Texas."" Her biggest financial support has come from lawyers and lobbyists ($444,651) including labor unions, followed by real estate donors ($340,185).\Greenhouse gas cap\On some environmental issues, such as a proposed cap on greenhouse gas emissions, Martinez and Denish appear to have a similar stance at first glance. But while both oppose a state greenhouse gas cap and trade rule -- they do so for different reasons.\Denish believes climate change is occurring, but that any effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions must be global and national, not state-by-state.\Martinez adheres to the climate change naysayer line, saying an emissions cap is anti-business, would increase taxes and isn't based on sound science.\The New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board held two weeks of heated hearings regarding a controversial greenhouse gas emissions rule. The New Mexico Environment Department and the nonprofit New Energy Economy have proposed separate regulations that would cap and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Any rule, if approved, would take effect in 2012. The EIB is scheduled to vote on the Environment Department petition on Election Day, Nov. 2.\The state petition seeks to require power plants, oil refineries and gas treatment facilities that produce more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide gas annually to reduce emissions by 2 percent a year from 2012 levels and allow industries to trade carbon credits within a Western states exchange.\Pit rule\In 2008, the state Oil Conservation Commission approved a rule to intended to reduce contamination of shallow groundwater aquifers from unlined pits that hold waste from oil and gas production.\The rule -- proposed by a task force of oil and gas representatives, environmentalists, ranchers and local government representatives -- requires producers to line pits used for temporarily storing production waste and later to haul the waste to a licensed disposal center.\Denish says ""one size doesn't fit all"" when it come to governmental rules and thinks the rule should be ""revisited."" In addition, she wants to adopt a process to make rulemaking more predictable and fair.\Martinez claims the pit rule has driven the cost per well up by ""as much as"" $250,000. But according to testimony by well producers during the pit rule hearing, the costs under the new rule run an extra $35,000 and $150,000, depending on the depth of the well. The $250,000 figure is the cost of cleaning up old ""legacy pits"" constructed before the pit rule.\Martinez also says New Mexico was the only state to see a drop in gas production in 2009 because the pit rule chased away producers. But Kansas also saw a decline in gas production. And the sharp drop in oil and gas prices was the major cause of reduced production in 2008 and 2009, according to a report on the Economic Impact of the Oil and Gas Industry by New Mexico State University economist C. Meghan Starbuck.\Oil and gas prices dropped by 70 percent or more in the last half of 2008 and remained depressed into 2009. Oil production in New Mexico actually increased in 2008 while natural gas production has seen a decline since two years before the pit rule.\This year, oil and gas leases in New Mexico brought in a record amount of money, according to the federal Bureau of Land Management.\""The idea that we're running industry out doesn't hold water,"" said petroleum engineer and attorney Mark Fesmire, head of the state's Oil Conservation Division.\Before the rule, field staff from the Oil Conservation Division found 800 cases of groundwater contamination due to oil and gas wastes. Since the final version of the rule was adopted, staff have found no contamination at pit sites.\Water realities\Neither candidate, in answering a specific question about the slow progress of adjudicating water rights, proposed a specific idea to help move those cases through the courts faster.\The snail's pace of water adjudications in the last century -- establishing who owns what legal rights to water resources -- remains a weak link in the New Mexico's ability to manage its water for the future while protecting senior water rights.\State Engineer John D'Antonio said additional funding and the lifting of a hiring freeze would help finish adjudications more quickly. But he doesn't expect that to happen during the state's current economic doldrums.\His office is involved in a dozen active adjudications involving 72,000 water-rights holders. He said his office has 50 vacancies and the litigation division has seen a 30 percent reduction in staff. ""We have a bare-bones staff for adjudications,"" D'Antonio said. ""Our goal is to finish these adjudications before starting new ones.""\The largest, potentially most volatile water rights adjudication -- the Middle Rio Grande area including Albuquerque -- has yet to go to court.\The Republican candidate was targeted by an unattributed video posted on YouTube that accused the El Paso native of wanting to ""send New Mexico's water to Texas."" The video was taken down shortly after a few newspapers and bloggers wrote about it.\Martinez would have no power to send extra water to Texas if she became New Mexico's governor, even if that was her desire. Water shares from both the Pecos River and Rio Grande that flow through New Mexico into Texas are governed by interstate stream compacts and multi-state commissions.\Contact Staci Matlock at 986-3055 or smatlock@sfnewmexican.com.\ON THE WEB\u To read the complete responses by the gubernatorial candidates to a questionnaire on environmental issues, go to The New Mexican's website at www.santafenewmexican.com/election."
65," From the Washington-won't-do-it, so-somebody-should file comes some promising news:\ California's legislature has mandated a 25 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions during the next 14 years -- a lofty goal considering the Golden State's growth in population and industry.\ But this is more than mere political posturing about greenhouse gases. It's more than a slap at Bush-administration failure to sign onto the Kyoto Protocol committing nations to reducing emissions in recognition of their effect on global warming.\ This is -- or at least will be when the details are worked out -- a specific and complicated plan of buying and selling increasingly rare carbon-emission allowances. Beneficiaries, besides the air- breathing people of our most populous state, are likely to include coastlines and their habitat, and the rest of the world under growing threat of a faster-warming planet.\ The California plan also is more than just Democratic politicians telling business and industry what to do. It was approved by Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger -- and it has the blessings of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. The huge utility, which supplies most of Northern California's electricity, broke with its fellow power monopolists to support the measure.\ If it goes as planned, carbon dioxide emissions, by 2020, will be reduced to where they were in 1990. That's still a lot of bad gas -- but by then technology might find ways to reduce it further.\ And any way you look at it, the effort beats the nothing being done by our national regime, whose politicians predict dire economic results for California.\ But they could be proven wrong: University of California researchers say the state could gain more than $70 billion in economic worth, and 80,000-90,000 new jobs developing the technology it will take to conserve energy or switch to cleaner sources.\ California becomes the second state to leave the federal government at the starting gate. New Mexico was first.\ Our state got into the act a year ago by joining the Chicago Climate Exchange. Along with a growing list of major industries -- Ford, IBM, DuPont -- and such progressive cities as Boulder, Colo. and Portland, Ore., we're committed to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.\ New Mexico's initial goal is a 4-percent cut by the end of this year; 11 million tons. We're not likely to make it -- so will pay $40,000 for ""credits"" in the cap-and-trade exchange system. However, what helped the state make a two-million-ton cut was lots of fuel conservation -- and that'll offset some of the money our state will owe the exchange.\ It's a pretty esoteric route toward both cleaner skies and reduced global warming -- but it's a start.\ In the meantime, New Mexico environment secretary Ron Curry is encouraged by PG&E's show of industrial good citizenship. He's been working with Jeff Sterba, head of Public Service Company of New Mexico, to put PNM on the rolls of the Chicago Climate Exchange.\ There are some encouraging sounds from PNM headquarters: Maybe no rush to the commitment exchange membership would carry -- but the company appears likely to take further steps toward voluntary reductions in carbon emissions. Wind and solar power, as well as forays into biomass fuels, could keep our state's biggest utility on the road to reform.\ En buena hora: Americans, if not our elected politicians, have shaken national apathy over global warming. We're willing to pay our share to fend it off -- and we're demanding the same from a business sector long skeptical of its existence.\ California may be the Left Coast, and Santa Fe a bunch of liberals in the eyes of lobbyists who'd like to ignore global warming. But with help from PNM and PG&E, we won't likely be alone for long."

FARMINGTON -- City councilors passed a resolution opposing two separate petitions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions ahead of hearings on one of the petitions scheduled to begin Monday.
\
The resolution opposes an emissions cap program proposed by Santa Fe environmental group New Energy Economy and a cap-and-trade program brought forth by the New Mexico Environment Department.
\
To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the city would have to ""rely on fuel-switching, cutting back operations, shutting down facilities or relocating facilities to another state as possible options,"" the city's resolution says.
\
Councilors on Tuesday night unanimously passed the resolution, proposed by Councilman Jason Sandel. The document is the third such statement from the city of Farmington opposing greenhouse gas emission limits.
\
Carbon dioxide ""if it is a hazardous material, is global issue. It's at least a national issue,"" said Mayor Tommy Roberts, who supported the new resolution. ""We know that we cannot do anything to impact that problem, to the extent it is a problem, by taking action at the state level and being the only state that takes action.""
\
City Council passed a similar resolution in December against the New Energy Economy's petition. Earlier this year, councilors passed a resolution supporting a lawsuit questioning the authority of the state Environmental Improvement Board, which is reviewing the petitions.
\
The New Energy Economy's petition since has changed and now calls for power plants and oil and gas facilities with carbon dioxide emissions exceeding 25,000 metric tons to reduce their emissions by 3 percent per year from 2010 levels.
\
In addition to disapproving of the environmental group's proposed rules, the city's new resolution also opposes the environment department's proposal.
\
The environment department has proposed a cap of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions with required 2 percent annual reductions for power plants, generation substations and large oil and gas facilities.
\
The proposed rule also would allow excess emissions to be bought and sold as a commodity on an open market shared with California and two Canadian provinces pursuing similar emissions rules.
\
The programs would add additional costs to the production of electricity for the Farmington Electric Utility System and ""these costs will have to be passed on to its customers,"" according to the city's resolution.
\
""It is not logistically feasible to install enough wind and solar power in (New Mexico) to make up for the reduction in power generation from traditional carbon-based sources, requiring the city of Farmington to purchase power from outside the state, most likely power generated from traditional carbon-based sources,"" the resolution states.
\
The regulations would reduce the number of energy industry jobs in San Juan County, the resolution adds.
\
Congress or the Environmental Protection Agency should address greenhouse gas emissions -- ""if they are to be addressed"" -- so that New Mexico does not experience ""economic disadvantage"" compared with its neighbors, the resolution states.
\
Councilors directed City Manager Rob Mayes to send copies of the resolution to Gov. Bill Richardson, state lawmakers and the environment department board.
\
The New Energy Economy has included provisions in its petition to limit costs to utility rate-payers, said John Fogarty, president of the environmental group. Experts have testified that that would result in a less than 1-percent increase in utility bills annually.
\
The rules would attract new businesses and investment in green energy that would create jobs, Fogarty said.
\
""It actually could be an economic boon,"" he said.
\
A three-year period during which utilities would be required to reduce their emissions 3 percent annually would ease the transition, he said. Then the state would re-evaluate the regulations.
\
""I think the City Council missed the boat,"" he said. ""I think they didn't do their homework. They didn't ask for any representatives, as far as I know, from New Energy Economy or others to describe the elements of the proposal. They just went ahead and passed this.""
\
Meanwhile, the environmental group is calling locals to encourage them to contact the governor's office to voice support for the petition.
\
The Farmington City Council has ""distorted"" the effects of the proposed rules so the group is calling people throughout the state to educate them on regulations' benefits, Fogarty said.
\
Sandel received a similar phone call before Tuesday night's meeting.
\
The group is presenting New Mexico as a ""test rat"" to encourage the federal government to pass similar regulations, Sandel said.
\
""To me, it's scary that we've got some regulators in Santa Fe that are considering having New Mexico be a pilot project,"" he said.
\
The Environmental Improvement Board will resume its review of the group's petition in October following hearings it held last month.

67,"
ALBUQUERQUE - The last eight years in New Mexico under the administration of Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson have seen hefty fines against environmental polluters and new regulations aimed at cracking down on greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Richardson and the state Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department also made efforts to protect Otero Mesa from oil and gas drilling, while the state Environment Department led the charge to enforce water quality standards from Los Alamos National Laboratory and Kirtland Air Force Base to the dairies scattered across southern New Mexico.
\
But with a new administration poised to take control under the direction of Republican Gov.-elect Susana Martinez, environmentalists and some state officials are concerned that environmental protections will be rolled back.
\
""I fear a scorched earth. I really do,"" said John Horning, executive director of the environmental group WildEarth Guardians.
\
Horning and others are worried that once Richardson leaves office, state government will turn a blind eye to regulation and cripple those agencies that are responsible for managing water and air quality, and natural resource development.
\
However, for industry groups and some state lawmakers, the end of the Richardson era could mean the end of what they refer to as a stranglehold on business that has resulted from regulation.
\
""We're in one of the worst economies we've ever seen, and what have we done? We've said we understand that the economy is crappy, we understand we have problems and, oh by the way, New Mexico, it's closed for business. We've shut down,"" said House Minority Whip Keith Gardner, of Roswell, who has been tapped to serve as Martinez's chief of staff.
\
The crackdown on polluters is evident by the settlements the Environment Department has been able to reach over the past eight years with dozens of companies that have violated their permits. The settlements total more than $74 million dollars, some of which has been funneled to the state's general fund.
\
Environment Secretary Ron Curry said many of the laws and regulations his department has been enforcing in recent years have been on the books for decades but were largely unused by previous administrations.
\
""The word accountability in the political world right now is very popular,"" Curry said. ""When you look at what we're doing, we're just trying to make people and entities accountable for the way they use the land and water. It's nothing more than that.""
\
Curry said his biggest concern would be rollbacks affecting water quality.
\
The state has tried to crack down on groundwater pollution from dairies and has been urging regulators to approve a sweeping proposal that would give special protection to some 700 miles of rivers and streams, 29 lakes and more than 4,900 acres of wetlands in a dozen federal wilderness areas around the state.
\
The state Oil Conservation Commission also adopted controversial rules aimed at safeguarding groundwater supplies from waste pits in oil and gas country.
\
""I think the state of New Mexico is going to see a full fledged attack by the special interests on water quality. That is very unfortunate because usually if you're attacking water quality, a lot of times you're looking at rural areas,"" Curry said.
\
Curry and others are also worried about the makeup of a committee appointed by the incoming governor to identify the state's next environment secretary. The committee is dominated by the oil and gas industry.
\
Oil and gas officials argue that many of the boards and commissions under the Richardson administration were weighted with members representing environmental interests.
\
With the tide turning, Michael Jensen of the group Amigos Bravos predicted ""an unprecedented effort"" at rolling back environmental and public health regulations, including the so-called pit rules and the state's new regional cap-and-trade program.
\
""This anti-regulatory philosophy is very shortsighted and even contradictory,"" he said. ""Those pushing for regulatory rollbacks claim that it is necessary for the state's economic health, but the fact is that fair and effective regulations benefit the state and its residents.""
\
Jensen, Horning and others said New Mexico could end up paying more in the long run if air and water quality is compromised.
\
Gardner argued that public policy needs to be about balance and science, rather than the feel-good attitudes of politicians.
\
""I think this is about someone trying to leave their mark,"" he said, referring to Richardson. ""That's what it's all about. It's not about good policy, it's about trying to create some kind of legacy.""
\
Marita Noon, executive director of Citizens' Alliance For Responsible Energy, sat through many of the hearings on the greenhouse gas regulations. She said energy has been a big part of New Mexico's economy but Richardson's policies, including his effort to cap emissions, are chasing businesses away.
\
""Nobody wants dirty air or dirty water. But the way the punishments are handed out have definitely been antibusiness,"" she said. ""It has nothing to do with what's good or right for the state of New Mexico.""
\
Industry groups and environmentalists both agree that Martinez and the Legislature which face a mounting budget deficit will have their hands full next year as everyone jockeys for a seat at the table to help chart New Mexico's course.
\
Curry said it's incumbent upon the new leaders to understand that environmental issues are not defined by Democrats or Republicans.
\
""I think you'll see efforts to roll things back, but the issues have always been developed based upon science and public input and if you keep developing them based on science and public input, I'm hopeful you'll see the same result,"" he said.

68,"
For more than a quarter century, the leading atmospheric research institutions of the United States and abroad have agreed that burning fossil fuels at our current rate causes global climate change. The predictions of those early theoretical models have since been confirmed empirically.
\
Our best and most independent research institutions also predict severe damage to our local, regional, national and global-scale socio-economic and ecological environments if we continue pouring carbon into our atmosphere. Even without the specter of global climate change and its associated economic crisis, our current addiction to cheap fossil fuels hurts local economies because fossil fuels have such poor multipliers.
\
Compare, for example, the household of four living in a large, poorly insulated house and driving a large vehicle, with one that commutes primarily by bicycle and who has invested in insulation and efficient light bulbs. The first family spends hundreds of dollars on utilities and fuel, most of which ""leaks"" out of local economies, while the second keeps that money saved circulating within local economies either as expenditures or as savings (i.e., capital for local business or household investments).
\
We have four options for dealing with the myriad problems associated with overuse of fossil fuels. We can 1) do nothing and try to react once things are way out of control and hope against all expectation that we can recover; 2) create a ""sin"" tax or establish punitive limits on carbon emissions (similar to a cigarette or alcohol tax or the establishment of speed limits - they are simple but wildly unpopular); 3) create a cap and trade market-based mechanism that creates an incentive for improved efficiencies at the scale of particular industries (similar to the markets successfully used to reduce acid rain caused by the high sulfur emissions produced by utility companies ); or 4) create a cap and dividend market mechanism that creates an incentive for individuals to change transportation and spending behaviors in a way that reduces their carbon footprint (this is similar to the bottle deposits that reduce littering of roadside glass. Here, the ""deposit"" occurs at the point where fossil fuels enter the American economy. The deposit cost gets passed down to the consumer in the form of higher prices for items and behaviors that have high carbon content. At the end of the year, each American will then get back a ""dividend"" as a lump sum that, if used wisely, can be used to improve individual position within the new economic environment).
\
For New Mexico, the best options are clear. Option 1 will result in significant economic and environmental damage, while option 2 is unpopular, inflexible, and demeaning. Options 3 and 4 both rely on the intelligence and flexibility of the market. The cap and trade (option 3) can be used within local, national, and international markets and is effective even with incomplete participation but is administratively cumbersome (the legislation is thousands of pages) in its attempts to find discrete values for carbon credits within diverse industries. The cap and dividend (option 4) is attractive because it is simple and wonderfully democratic.
\
If we go back to the example of the two families mentioned earlier, the cap and dividend would provide both families with approximately $1,000 to insulate their homes, buy bicycles or energy efficient appliances, start a garden in the front yard, etc. Since a reduction in carbon footprint is explicitly tied to making money, the dividend approach is most likely to meet and exceed legislative goals for carbon reductions while increasing the multiplier effect of New Mexico household incomes. Simply put, cap legislation, particularly cap and dividend, is good for our economy, good for New Mexicans, and good for the planet.

CO2 is green, green, green.
\
Enough already! The extreme environmentalism agenda being pushed in Santa Fe recently demands that any elected person who supports ""New Mexico cap and trade,"" should be denounced as ""science"" frauds and their constituents should start recall petitions immediately.
\
Respected local scientists and members of the Cruces Atmospheric Sciences Forum have been attempting to ""educate"" our various politicians (state and federal) on the fact that CO2 is not a pollutant. This is in stark contrast to that opinion held by the head of our national EPA. CO2 is a natural constituent of all livings things - it is quite natural. Without CO2, Earth would be a dead planet. Every blade of grass, tree leaf or needle on this planet must have CO2 in order to survive.

This center is conducting CO2 research and its impact on the world, and their website, www.co2science@org, has a new posting every Wednesday. Those interested in learning the facts and reality of Al Gore and his Inconvenient Truth are advised to read the postings on this website.
\
The center has been conducting research with sealed, CO2 controlled environments, and have concluded that grass, plants and lizards thrive on higher levels of CO2 - a fact not surprising to knowledgeable biologists, botanists and zoologists.

Recently, a Christian pastor of a church in Florida publicized his disdain for the holy book of the Muslim people, the Quran. He considers its teaching as leading people to hell and remarked that he would be sponsoring a day when he would preside over the burning of copies of the Quran. I consider his words and coming action reprehensible.
\
We are fast approaching the anniversary of one of the most tragic chapters in the life of our nation: the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. These actions, as heinous as they are, were those of a very small minority in the Muslim community and were based on an interpretation and manipulation of the Quran, and have been widely condemned by Muslim clerics and laity alike.
\
In the short time I have been in Silver City, I have found it to be a place that is open to a wide and eclectic variety of beliefs and ways of life. I am convinced that, no matter what faith one espouses, the majority of us would find intolerance and violence to other faiths unacceptable and not reflective of who we are.
\
For these reasons, I am inviting the Silver City community, no matter what faith you hold, to attend a service of tolerance and solidarity with our Muslim sisters and brothers on Sept. 11 at 6 p.m., at the Valley Community Church United Church of Christ. The Rev. Martin Niemoller, a pastor during World War II in Germany once said, when (the Nazis) came for the Unionists, Communists and Jews, he did not speak for he was none of those. When they came for him, there was no one left to speak for him.
\
We need to speak out to that Florida pastor and say emphatically, not here in Silver City! Come join me in this declaration on Sept. 11.

FARMINGTON -- A local man was nominated to a controversial state board that issues environmental regulations.
\
Gov. Susana Martinez on Friday nominated John Volkerding, general manager of Basin Disposal in Aztec and Bloomfield, for a seat on the seven-member Environmental Improvement Board.
\
Volkerding faces confirmation by the state Senate.
\
Volkerding, 43, graduated from Farmington High School in 1985. He earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from New Mexico State University and a doctoral degree in environmental engineering from Kennedy-Western University.
\
He served in the U.S. Navy aboard a submarine, and also managed the New Mexico Department of Energy's Oversight Bureau in Albuquerque.
\
""I would characterize my philosophy as making sure that we have a balance between having a strong, vibrant economy and protecting the environment,"" he said in an interview Monday.
\
Volkerding is poised to join a board that Martinez targeted for changes during her first week in office.
\
Martinez dismissed the entire board Jan. 4, saying the members ""have made it clear that they are more interested in advancing political ideology than implementing common-sense policies that balance economic growth with responsible stewardship in New Mexico.""
\
The board issued new cap-and-trade regulations in December, during the waning days of Gov. Bill Richardson's administration. The regulations would require reductions of greenhouse gases from industrial sources. They will not go into effect until Jan. 2013 at the earliest.
\
Volkerding's nomination must be confirmed by the Democrat-controlled state Senate. His nomination likely will be considered later this month, said Laine Sedillo, secretary for the Senate Rules Committee.
\
Volkerding has worked with Basin Disposal for five years. The company treats wastewater from oil and gas drilling, then reinjects the fluids underground.
\
He declined to comment on the cap-and-trade rules, saying an appeal may come before him on the board.
\
Asked for his take on global warming, he said, ""I don't know. I think it is an extremely complex issue with lots of variables, and it is something that needs to be studied. And that's about as far as I know.""
\
Volkerding said he pursued an advanced degree from Kennedy-Western, an unaccredited and now defunct institution, because he was working for the state and traveling frequently. The institution came under scrutiny from accreditors and regulators before closing in 2009.
\
In announcing the nominations of Volkerding and two others, Martinez said she has ""asked the Environmental Improvement Board to work diligently to balance economic growth with the need to protect New Mexico's natural beauty.""
\
She added, ""In order to move New Mexico forward, the EIB must strive to make decisions based on scientific evidence and common sense. Injecting politics into the business that comes before the EIB only does a disservice to our state as we strive to attract business, foster growth and get our economy back on track.""

\
New Mexico's unemployment numbers are looking a little better. So why is it still so hard to find a job? Why is our economy in slow motion while surrounding states rebound?
\
""We're not adding jobs,"" said Beverlee McClure, president of the Association of Commerce and Industry, during a talk last week to business leaders.
\
Employers aren't willing or able to do much hiring. (Unless they're in Artesia. An ACI member there told McClure, ""If you can fog a mirror, we can put you to work."")
\
McClure's message: ""If we're not talking about jobs, we're not talking about the right thing.""
\
During the regular session last year, jobs weren't on anybody's to-do list. Gov. Susana Martinez entered office with no plan other than a promise to scrutinize regulation, and the Legislature was preoccupied with balancing the budget. Economic Development Secretary Jon Barela has been invisible, I'm told by good sources, because he's under the governor's thumb. ""But he has a lot of good ideas,"" say his supporters.
\
OK, let's see some.
\
McClure predicts greater focus on jobs in the next session. ""I hope we will come together and pick three to five things we can make happen.""
\
So far, it's one step forward and one step back.
\
Job creators, anxiously watching for signs of an economic thaw, are keeping an eye on the state's dwindling unemployment fund. During the regular session legislators approved a proposal, supported by business groups, to raise unemployment insurance premiums then rather than face a big hike later on.
\
The governor vetoed it, Democrats challenged it in court, and compromise proposals failed during the special session. If the court overrules the veto, New Mexico has no rate, and the federal government can step in, probably setting the highest rate, McClure said, although the next session may see another compromise.
\
Behind the headlines: Martinez refused to raise what she insists on calling ""taxes"" because it might hurt the image she's cultivating. She resisted proposals from McClure and Terri Cole of the Albuquerque Chamber - two powerhouses in the business community - because she thought they were too close to former Gov. Bill Richardson. Note to governor: It's the job of people like McClure and Cole to maintain ties with governors.
\
Had Martinez checked, she would have found McClure as far to the right as she is, and nobody would mistake Cole for a liberal. The three later came together and made nice. McClure and Cole got behind the governor, sort of, and since then McClure's comments on the unemployment fund have been cautious.
\
Martinez was sure her regulatory fixes and an improving economy would stabilize the fund. That didn't happen.
\
Back in the real world, employers are operating in survival mode, maintaining skeleton crews and trying to hang on to their best people.
\
A rural contractor told me that with fewer people, the jobs take longer, and it's a reality he has to accept. If his unemployment premiums jump, he could be paying $600 per employee every quarter instead of the present average of $215, and his already thin margins get even thinner.
\
Business people hate uncertainty, and New Mexico has it in abundance. By signing the original compromise bill, Martinez could have removed one thorn of uncertainty from the business paw. Instead, the problem has dragged on for a year.
\
On the positive side, Martinez is making good on her promise to ease job-killing regulations and make New Mexico more competitive.
\
Last week hearings ended on the cap-and-trade rule - Richardson's parting shot at New Mexico. Climate change is real, but this rule will do nothing but increase costs to the energy industry and consumers, and it's already driven away prospective employers. Martinez's appointee to the Environment Department testified that his agency no longer supports the rule.
\
Shelving state cap-and-trade would remove another big thorn. It's a good start.

73,"A scientific study reported at the Joint Assembly in Montreal this past May indicates that humans are dumping extra carbon into the atmosphere at a rate unprecedented since at least the time the dinosaurs went extinct. ""Not a single event during the past 66 million years released carbon as fast as we're releasing now,"" paleoclimatologist Richard Zeebe reported. \The scientific evidence is unequivocal that human activity is a major contributor to global warming and climate change, and that global warming and climate change are an existential threat to humanity. The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that ""we must switch mostly to renewals by 2050 and phase out fossil fuels by 2100 to avoid the most damaging and potentially irreversible impacts of climate change."" Ominously, a July research report in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Journal warns that ""2 degree C global warming is highly dangerous"": Climate modeling predicts increasing ""ice melt, sea level rise and super storms."" \Comprehensive action to combat climate change and global warming cannot wait. It demands top priority as an issue with the United States public and for action at all levels of government. However, this is not the case. A Pew Research poll of the public's policy priorities for 2015 places the environment at 13th with only a 51 percent rating, even though 46 percent of the public believes that global warming is a very serious problem. In Congress, the party in power has no priority to combat global warming. There are still deniers, and there are those who acknowledge global warming but question that human activity has contributed significantly. \Some states are taking the lead: California has an ambitious cap-and-trade system. Nine Northeastern states take part in a regional cap-and-trade system. Here in New Mexico, we were a participant in the Western Climate Initiative, a cap-in-trade consortium of Western states and Quebec, but it fell apart in 2011. What remains is Western Climate Initiative Inc., a nonprofit formed to develop administrative and technical services to support the implementation of state and provincial greenhouse gas emissions trading programs. \A letter published Oct. 1 in The Washington Post and the Financial Times from 10 of the world's biggest food companies ""urged Congress to support a strong global agreement on climate action in advance of the U.N. climate talks happening this December."" This may have some influence, but I believe that to get Congress on board, the risk of action versus no or delayed action must be quantified by scientific organizations (e.g. our Santa Fe Institute) and economists in terms of cost-in-dollars for specific environmental systems, geographic locations and populations affected by global warming and climate change. For example, a report compiled for the insurance industry by the U.K.-based Tyndall Centre in 2009 warned that a possible rise in sea levels by 2050 ""could put at risk $28 trillion worth of assets in the world's largest coastal cities."" On the flip side, a new report by NextGen Climate America found that transitioning to a clean energy economy would be an economic boon to the United States, adding a million jobs by 2030 and 2 million jobs by 2050. \We have the technology to combat global warming; we need the political will to implement it. Senate Resolution 244, submitted in August, details the risk and the consequences of delayed action. It should be passed on a bipartisan basis before the December world conference. The U.S. must join other developed countries and put in effect a meaningful cap-in-trade system or carbon tax. Here in New Mexico, we should lead an effort to revive the Western Climate Initiative. \Fred Bender is a concerned citizen and a retired mining-related metallurgical engineer.\Credit: Fred Bender"

Business people are realists above all, and they are recognizing that cap-and-trade schemes will not change a thing. Only carbon taxes and tariffs can lead to the phase-out of traditional polluting power sources.
\
Without a carbon tax, investors will not commit to renewable energy, and global warming will continue.
\
President Obama is disappointing voters on climate change, and the feeling is probably mutual. Please remember, Obama cannot impose a solution for global warming or any other massive problem, including the deficit. He can only lead where voters want to follow.
\
That is why we (the people) need to start demanding carbon taxation, loudly and incessantly, until everyone in Washington gets the message.
\
Americans do have the political will power to overturn the status quo. They demonstrated that in the presidential election.
\
We know change is possible. These days, almost everyone understands that the switch to renewable energy is necessary for economic success, as well as for a healthy environment.
\
But people should also understand that affordable clean energy alone is not enough to prevent climate change, or even to boost the economy.
\
It's very simple: Big Coal, the oil cartel, and nuclear power will always be willing to sell energy a little cheaper than the green competition.
\
After all, they are already heavily invested in those particular resources. Extraction is essentially free for them, because they burn their own carbon sources to do the work.
\
That is how Canada has hit the jackpot with tar sands. This incredibly destructive product is enough to wreck the climate by itself, if it is all burned.
\
Apparently they are tired of the snow up there, and they are doing something about it.
\
I will give the Canadians this though: No nonsense about clean coal, nuclear fusion, or carbon sequestration. Business and politics should be so honest in America.
\
The good news is, people all over the world want a solution for global warming. The bad news is, some giant corporations are ready and willing to convert all the hydrocarbons and uranium ore on Earth into greenhouse gases and toxic waste.
\
We must defend ourselves. It's time for voters to demand direct taxes on American producers of non-renewable energy, along with reasonable tariffs on products from countries like Canada that continue to grow the problem.
\
It is also time, I believe, for the Obamas and the Bidens to rally the majority of citizens who have been silent so far, to start protecting our long-term interests.
\
People are very worried about the growing federal deficit, even more so than about global warming. One good way to start back towards balanced budgets would be to replace the cap-and-trade approach with a new system of environmental surcharges and tariffs.
\
Obviously, that would be a colossal source of new revenue.
\
Americans have been paying attention. Working and unemployed citizens are already expecting higher prices at the gas pump because of the environmental costs of oil.
\
But far more important, most people expect rich corporations and individuals to start paying their full share of the cost of government.
\
Voters are outraged that the United States is on the hook for trillions because of predatory financiers. People want a much higher tax for the top bracket, and they want it now.
\
The majority of voters also think the wealthy (and greedy) corporations that are polluting the planet should start paying stiff taxes on their carbon and waste production.
\
But demands by the public are not enough. Effective change on global warming and the deficit will require bolder action from the President and Congress than we have seen so far.
\
Don't get me wrong: Barack Obama is the right person for the job. American voters wanted peace, first and foremost, and Obama is delivering. U.S. foreign policy today is based on cooperation, not conquest.
\
The campaign to reform health care is also a plus for this Administration.
\
Perhaps most important, Obama has steered the country clear of a Bush-caused economic disaster. Now more spending is needed for infrastructure, and he is taking action to create those jobs.
\
Still, if President Obama wants a stable future for his family and everyone else, he will have to become more audacious than ever.
\
Despite the risks, Barack Obama and Joe Biden should resolve to lead a political surge of committed citizens and legislators this year, to pass the crucial reforms this country needs.

FARMINGTON -- Community business leaders during a meeting hosted Tuesday by San Juan Economic Development Service and PNM were encouraged to voice opposition to two proposed emissions cap rules being considered by state regulators.
\
The meeting, held at San Juan Country Club, invited more than 50 representatives from area oil and gas companies and elected officials to review a local assessment of how the proposed emissions regulations being considered by the state Environmental Improvement Board in August and September would affect the Farmington area economy.
\
The briefing focused on two petitions proposed to combat climate change, including the Santa Fe-based environmental advocacy group New Energy Economy in 2008 seeking a cap and mandatory annual reductions of greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and oil and gas operations.
\
A second petition filed by the New Mexico Environment Department this year has proposed a similar cap and required reductions for utilities and industrial operations, but could allow a market-based trading system for emissions in excess of state-imposed limits.
\
Creating a state-based emissions regulation while the federal government has chosen to not adopt a national plan puts New Mexico-based business at a disadvantage that encourages energy investment in neighboring states, said Bruce Gantner, an environmental consultant with ConocoPhillips who spoke Tuesday on behalf of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association.
\
""Our state would be at an economic disadvantage either by introducing new costs to business or by causing ... reduced production of electricity and oil and gas in this state,"" Gantner said of the NMED proposal. ""There's still opportunity on that one to have your voice heard.""
\
The NMED proposal is more likely to be adopted because the regulation establishes itself as the enforcement agency, Gantner said.
\
Community leaders claimed the proposed emissions-cap regulations would disproportionately affect the San Juan County economy. The measure would not affect Albuquerque because the state's largest city has an independent air quality control agency.
\
Farmington City Manager Rob Mayes said 67 percent of the facilities targeted by the proposed regulations for reduced emissions are located in San Juan County.
\
""They are our jobs, they are our economic base and tax base. San Juan County and the city of Farmington and our region, we are set squarely in the cross-hairs of the target of this plan,"" Mayes said.
\
Calling Farmington's 45,000 utility customers ""potential victims,"" Mayes said the regulations would spill over into all sectors of the local economy causing a ""death spiral,"" where energy costs rise, jobs are cut and residents leave the area.
\
""Make no mistake about it, we are fighting for our very economic existence and our way of life,"" Mayes said. ""Why are we shooting ourselves in the foot when the surrounding states have arms wide open to receive our wealth and our jobs.""
\
PNM governmental affairs representative Jeff Buell said the Farmington meeting was one of three being held statewide to keep business leaders with the proposed regulations. Other meetings will be held in Albuquerque and Carlsbad.
\
""We're really trying to help bring an understanding of what's happening,"" Buell said. ""Our effort is to share what we've learned and keep them up to speed.""
\
PNM previously has said it would consider slowing operations at San Juan Generating Station, and potentially closing the power plant, if state-based emissions rules are set.
\
Buell said no one from the New Mexico Environment Department was invited to the community meeting to offer the agency's perspective on the plan.
\
Some opposition to the proposed emissions rules is ""unfounded rhetoric,"" NMED Environment and Energy Policy Coordinator Sandra Ely said.
\
An economic feasibility study of the proposed cap and trade program projected the rules if adopted would have a positive economic impact statewide. The study, however, did not consider economic effects of the rule on a county level, Ely said.
\
""We feel pretty good about the rules, and think they're sound,"" Ely said. ""I'm not sure from what page they're singing from when they talk about the negative economic impact of the proposed rules.""
\
Environmental Improvement Board hearings on the New Energy Economy petition are scheduled to begin Aug. 16 in Santa Fe. Formal hearings for the NMED proposal in Santa Fe are set to begin Sept. 20; a Farmington-based hearing on that rule is planned for early September.

78," SANTA FE -- Big questions loom about how New Mexico and other western states will meet their goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.\ And the eight U.S. western states and Canadian provinces partnered in the Western Climate Initiative have only a year to come up with answers.\ State environment officials met with industry and environmental representatives Thursday in Santa Fe to detail the work plan for developing a market-based system to reduce emissions by 15 percent below 2005 levels within 13 years.\ The meeting at the state Environment Department headquarters was the first in a series of New Mexico meetings about the initiative, which is expected to rely on a cap-andtrade program in which there are economic incentives for companies to pollute less.\ Under such a system, the government sets a cap on the amount of pollutants that can be emitted. Companies and other emitters of greenhouse gases are given allowances for how much they can pollute. Companies that need to pollute beyond their limit can then purchase additional allowances from those that pollute less.\ But which sectors of the economy will be subject to the program still needs to be determined, officials said Thursday. That's because while it's easy to track emissions from the electric industry, for example, calculating how much the agricultural sector is polluting is trickier.\ Another question: whether the pollution credits should be given away free, auctioned off or transferred through combination of the two approaches.\ Five subcommittees made up of representatives from the participating states and provinces will tackle these and other issues over the next year with the goal of having the outlines of a cap-and-trade program completed by August 2008."

FARMINGTON -- Mayor Tommy Roberts on Wednesday criticized environmental regulations that he said fail to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the environment and economic growth.
\
""We need to continually advocate for balance,"" Roberts said. ""And what I see in these regulations is a lack of balance.""
\
Farmington leaders have raised concern about regulations that target key local extractive industries, primarily natural gas and coal production.
\
Among them are emissions regulations instituted by the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board under former Gov. Bill Richardson, the pit rule that regulates the disposal of wastewater from natural gas drilling and federal proposals to drastically cut emissions at the area's two coal-burning power plants.
\
""Is that balance?"" Roberts said. ""I don't think so. When you go beyond balance to satisfy philosophical or ideological obligations, then I think you're heading in the wrong direction.""
\
Roberts spoke at a San Juan County board of Realtors luncheon held at San Juan Country Club.
\
The mayor, who is nearing the end of his first year in office, said the pit rule was passed despite ""not one single incident of groundwater contamination in Northwest New Mexico.""
\
Regarding the Environment Improvement Board's cap and trade plan, he said New Mexico does not need to lead the way on regulations to combat global warming.
\
""Does New Mexico need to be enacting these rules and regulations when no one else is?"" he said. ""It just doesn't make a whole lot of sense.""
\
Roberts said Farmington eventually must consider raising sales taxes to fund infrastructure improvements that would attract businesses.
\
However, he said there is ""no sentiment"" on the City Council for raising taxes anytime soon.
\
Cheryl Ragsdale, president of the Realtors board, gave a brief legislative update.
\
She said the group is opposed to SB 320, a state bill that she said would ""kill seller financing in New Mexico.""
\
Roberts pointed to a group of business and civic leaders known as E > P, of which he is a member, as a possible avenue for attracting new businesses to Farmington.
\
The name stands for employment that is greater than population, the group's stated goal for economic growth.
\
""We can't put all our eggs in the natural gas industry basket, or the coal industry basket,"" he said. ""We've got to diversify. Ultimately, we're going to have to improve our infrastructure locally.""
\
Roberts said the group is studying Farmington's demographics and assets that could attract companies.
\
""It is a process that I endorse as mayor,"" he said.

ALBUQUERQUE -- Gov. Susana Martinez's administration is making good on campaign promises to drop new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions as well as other controversial rules passed in the waning days of the previous administration.
\
Officials at the state Environment Department have requested to keep the greenhouse gas reduction rules, as well as new pollution-control measures aimed at the dairy industry, from being published in upcoming editions of the Register.
\
Without publication, the rules will not take effect.
\
John Martinez, director of the state Administrative Law Division at the state records center, confirmed Wednesday he had received the request and that the rules would not be published.
\
The move was welcomed by Farmington Mayor Tommy Roberts. The city of Farmington has launched a lawsuit seeking to halt the regulations.
\
""The effort to enact regulations was politically motivated,"" Roberts said Wednesday. ""I think there was disregard for the impact of the regulations on business in New Mexico.""
\
The move is being criticized by environmental groups and lawyers who spent the past two years debating the merits of the rules before the state Environmental Improvement Board and the Water Quality Control Commission. Both panels endured days of public and expert testimony and had to review thousands of pages of documents before making their decisions.
\
The critics contend the administration is circumventing the law.
\
""In order to change an existing rule you have to go through the same process that you went through to adopt the rule. (Martinez) is trying to short circuit the process. She's trying to be above the law,"" said Bruce Frederick, an attorney with the New Mexico Environmental Law Center, which represented the nonprofit group New Energy Economy in its petition before the EIB for the greenhouse gas regulations.
\
Mike Eisenfeld, New Mexico energy coordinator for San Juan Citizens Alliance, said Martinez's action will only extend Northwest New Mexico's reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, a prospect he called ""problematic.""
\
""It appears that she's already creating a divisive situation, and some of the regulations that are in place are necessary,"" he said. ""I understand that this is a political decision on her part, but I think it creates a lot of animosity.""
\
The Martinez administration contends that canceling the publication of the rules is necessary to comply with an executive order issued by Martinez on her first day in office that halts all pending regulations by executive agencies to determine whether they hurt businesses in New Mexico.
\
The order also directs agencies to review rules and regulations that are in place and determine by the end of the month which ones should be scrapped to improve economic development and job growth.
\
That review will likely include the state's cap-and-trade rules, which were approved in November and published in the Register in December.
\
Martinez has long been critical of the state's efforts to regulate greenhouse gases, saying ""cap and tax"" policies will be costly for New Mexico families and will force businesses from the state.
\
Up for debate is whether officials at the Environment Department have the authority to call back the regulations after they were filed last month with the state records office.
\
According to state law, a rule filing with the state records office can be canceled by the agency, commission or board that adopted and issued the regulations in the first place. In the case of the greenhouse gas reduction rules, that would be the Environmental Improvement Board.
\
Martinez dismissed the entire board on Tuesday, saying their services were no longer needed. It was not immediately clear when she planned to announce her own appointments to the board.
\
Another point of contention is whether the greenhouse gas regulations and other disputed rules should be classified as ""pending"" and fall under the governor's executive order since they have not been published in the Register. Martinez's office contends the rules are not ""final and effective"" without publication.
\
Others argue that regulators formally adopted the rules when they voted on them during last year's hearings.
\
""Really this is an end-run around a public process,"" said Steve Michel, chief counsel for Western Resource Advocates' energy program and an expert who testified on behalf of New Energy Economy's greenhouse gas petition.
\
In dismissing the EIB on Tuesday, Martinez questioned the public process behind the greenhouse gas rules. She noted that the EIB moved forward after state lawmakers rejected a similar proposal during the legislative process and that a majority of the board members were ""more interested in advancing political ideology than implementing common sense policies.""

"
82," Gov. Bill Richardson will sign an executive order today, ramping up his efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in New Mexico and calling on state agencies to investigate cutting-edge programs.\ For example, he wants to see the creation of a regional carbon trading program and capture of carbon emissions from power plants.\ The aggressive campaign against climate change will match or exceed what California and other leading states have done, state Environment Secretary Ron Curry said Wednesday.\ ""This executive order is as significant as anything we've seen in the Western United States,"" Curry said.\ The executive order calls for new cars sold in New Mexico to emit less greenhouse gases -- something Richardson already endorsed last month -- as well as mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reporting by industry.\ A diverse 40-member climate advisory group this month gave Richardson 69 recommendations, 67 of them unanimous, to cut emissions.\ Global warming could reduce snowpack, deepen droughts and cause other negative effects in New Mexico.\ The broad consensus from the advisory group ""has caused the governor to want to move forward as fast as he can,"" Curry said.\ Richardson's executive order is expected to address 12 of the recommendations and the rest will be handled administratively or through the Legislature and Environmental Improvement Board, Curry said.\ ""It's going to be a three-pronged attack,"" he said.\ The order will mandate more study of several possible measures, including:\ Ways to cut emissions from oil and gas production, the second- largest contributor of greenhouse gases in the state.\ The effectiveness and feasibility of a mandatory market-based emission reduction program with a regional or national scope.\ Capturing methane and carbon dioxide for reuse to force more oil and gas from old fields.\ Sequestration of carbon dioxide from power plants in underground geologic formations.\ In addition, the order will tell the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department to work to implement energy conservation programs and incentives for renewable energy and for such projects as turning heat generated by large boilers into power.\ Richardson also wants incentives for dairies to capture methane gas from manure and turn it into electricity, said Jim Norton, director of the Environment Department's Environmental Protection Division.\ Norton called the possibility of creating a regional cap-and- trade program -- something California lawmakers recently endorsed -- an ""exciting"" step.\ Last year, Richardson set goals of cutting the state's greenhouse gas emissions to year 2000 levels by 2012 and 75 percent below 2000 levels by 2050.\ New Mexico also was the first state to join the Chicago Climate Exchange, which requires members to reduce their carbon emissions."
83," What the anti-environment Bush administration and the Republican Party have failed to do for six years, a coalition of American corporations and executives, including New Mexico's PNM Resources, now hopes to accomplish.\ Their goal, announced Monday: Get the federal government to set carbon dioxide emission limits to begin addressing the grave global climate consequences of heating up the Earth's atmosphere. They called on Congress and the White House ""to quickly enact strong national legislation to achieve significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.""\ PNM and its CEO and president, Jeff Sterba, deserve praise for being among 10 major U.S. corporations taking the high road on this crucial global environmental issue. The challenge for them is to get a majority of America's power companies also to buy in.\ As Sterba well knows, New Mexico's two U.S. senators -- Jeff Bingaman, a Silver City Democrat, and Pete Domenici, an Albuquerque Republican -- should play a leading role in getting global warming to the top of the nation's agenda. Both serve on the Senate Energy Committee and should push hard for mandatory emission controls advocated by these corporate executives and environmental groups.\ While the Oval Office, Congress, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers continue to have their collective heads stuck in the sand, Monday's call for drastic action came from PNM, but also from heavy corporate hitters like General Electric, DuPont, Aloca, Duke Energy and Caterpillar.\ Monday may well be marked as a historic turning point in the debate -- which has gone on way too long and focused wrongly on the ""need for more definitive science"" -- over whether the United States should act to reduce its carbon-emission burden in the Earth's atmosphere.\ PNM, part of the U.S. Climate Change Partnership of companies and environmental groups that called for immediate action, can justifiably claim now to be part of the solution.\ Sterba's comments were bold and insightful, focusing hopeful concern for those we have been victimizing by our inaction.\ ""The unique challenge of climate change is that it requires action now on a problem that will affect our grandchildren more than it will affect us,"" he said. ""With the right framework to address this problem and even create unique opportunities within our society, I believe the USGAP approach is the right approach.""\ Appropriately, these corporations join several American cities and states in demanding a comprehensive policy that is compatible with the hard science and the global call for action.\ They stood shoulder to shoulder at the National Press Club with four major environmental groups -- the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Pew Center on Global Climate Change and the World Resources Institute. This sends a strong signal that the old ways of conflict between corporations and those seeking to protect the environment are waning. In reaching out to sound environmental groups, these CEOs are saying global warming is not just an environmental problem but an economic, social and strategic challenge to the entire world.\ Even the Pentagon has recognized its implications for national security.\ In a letter to Bush, the coalition called for a ""coordinated, economywide, market-driven approach to climate protection"" that would allow a national ""cap and trade program"" for CO2 emissions.\ Several bills pending in Congress would employ this approach, including proposals by presidential hopefuls Sen. Barrack Obama, an Illinois Democrat, and Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican.\ Domenici and Bingaman could be useful in forging a veto-proof bipartisan majority to enact caps on CO2 emissions and a national strategy for long-term reductions, as well as addressing the ramifications of global climate change on our cities, states and economies.\ Bush, who is expected to address the issue in his State of the Union speech tonight by calling for voluntary measures, apparently still doesn't get it. He should admit he was grossly mistaken on global warming and begin a dialogue with Congress on the need for a comprehensive national global warming strategy -- beginning with mandatory CO2 emission controls."
84,"Egolf's ties to oilmen don't steer his policy\By Steve Terrell\The New Mexican\State Rep. Brian Egolf's great-grandfather was the founder of the American Petroleum Association of America. Egolf's father, until a few years ago, was an oilman, who drilled in Oklahoma and Texas.\But oil-industry representatives aren't exactly reacting with joy at the news that a ""member of the family"" is heading to the House Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\In fact, because of the younger Egolf's public positions on environment and conservation issues, some in the energy industry worry that Gov. Susana Martinez's agenda of rolling back environmental regulations just got harder.\Speaking at a meeting of Leadership Santa Fe, a program sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce, Egolf said Monday that because of an even split on his committee among Democrats and Republicans, few bills that are controversial will gain passage.\And that doesn't sound good to the New Mexico Oil & Gas Association, which is hoping the Legislature passes a bill to prevent cap-and-trade regulations approved last year by the Environmental Improvement Board.\""Certainly Mr. Egolf's public positions have been a challenge for the industry,"" said Steve Henke, executive director of New Mexico Oil & Gas Association. ""I suspect since Mr. Egolf controls the committee agenda, we may have difficulty being heard.""\Henke later added, ""We're willing to work with him as chairman.""\Rep. Dennis Kintigh, a Roswell Republican assigned to Egolf's committee, described Egolf as ""smart"" and ""sincere."" But asked how Martinez's energy proposals will be affected by Egolf's chairmanship, Kintigh said, ""It may be hard for the governor's agenda to survive in \Mr. Egolf's committee.""\A Martinez spokesman added, ""The governor looks forward to working in a bipartisan manner, with Rep. Egolf and others, to promote economic growth and environmental stewardship; as she said in her State of the State address, these are not mutually exclusive goals. She is also hopeful that members of the Legislature will pass regulations that are based on science, not ideology.""\Egolf bristles at any notion that he won't be willing to hear certain bills. ""I intend to be fair and even-handed,"" he said Monday. He promised not to use procedural tricks to defeat legislation he doesn't like. ""I think we, meaning the Democrats, are right on these issues,"" he said. ""We don't need to cheat.""\He said that in addition to discussing bills, he plans to schedule at least a couple of hearings in which certain energy-related issues are discussed to obtain data about certain questions. One of these discussions, he said, will address the environmental regulations' effect on the economy.\""I want to establish what's real and what's rhetoric,"" Egolf said. He said he believes some opponents of regulation have exaggerated the effects of regulations, such as the pit rules, which are aimed at safeguarding groundwater supplies from waste pits in oil-and-gas country. Egolf said he would bring in nonpartisan experts, but Republicans could invite any experts they wanted.\Kintigh said this is a good idea, but said he wasn't sure the committee would have time to do it, considering the crush of bills expected this session. ""That might be more appropriate for an interim committee,"" he said, referring to legislative committees that meet between sessions.\Egolf said his past positions on environmental issues have provoked hate mail from opponents who called him a ""communist"" and even a ""foreign agent.""\He said his positions on the environment are ""conservative"" in the old sense of the world. Businesses should take personal responsibility for cleaning up their messes, he said, and should be willing to pay ""the true cost of doing business."""

87,"
The April 25 op-ed titled, ""Global warming: An appeal to basic fairness,"" is factually incorrect and misleading. The article is a bad argument for the fossil fuel industry, as to say don't worry about climate change, pollution is good for you.
\
Contrary to the writer's opinions, climate science is not ""a young science."" The Chinese scientist Shen Kuo (1031-1095) observed climate change by studying fossilized bamboo. Edmund Halley mapped trade winds in 1686 and Ben Franklin was the first to map the gulf stream.
\
The author stated the ""earth has not warmed at all for the last 15 years"" but he doesn't site any source to back up his claim. According to NASA scientists, ""2012 was the ninth warmest of any year since 1880, continuing a long term trend of rising global temperatures."" Excluding 1998, ""the nine warmest years in the 132-year record all have occurred since 2000, with 2010 and 2005 ranking as the hottest years on record.""
\
The author takes what James Hansen of NASA said out of context. Hansen said the ""pace of warming appears to have slowed somewhat, describing a temporary standstill, (scientificamerican.com)."" However, Hansen attributed the cooling to La Niña and noted that each past several decades has been hotter than the last and warming should pick up again."" On the decadal time scale, it's going to get warmer because we know the planet is out of energy balance"" Hansen said.
\
The author recommends climatedepot.com for a single source on climate change which was created by CFACT, (Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow). Similar to the Cooler Heads Coalition and the National Consumer Coalition, CFACT has received $582,000 dollars from ExxonMobil since 1998, (exxonsecrets.org). Also mentioned in the article is the Heartland Institute.
\
The Heartland Institute which also refutes the dangers of second hand smoke, is a member of the corporate bill mill, ALEC (American Legislative Exchange Council), which receives hundreds of thousands of dollars from billionaires like the Koch brothers, (sourcewatch.org).The author's point of view is less a climate science dissenter's than a playbook for the fossil fuel industry.
\
He concludes by appealing to fairness of a balanced approach by listening to both sides of the climate change argument, like both sides are equally numbered, credible and objective -- but they are not. All national and international science agencies from the National Academy of Science to the National Science Foundation, NASA, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Pentagon, the World Health Organization, the United Nations to a huge majority of climatologists, all say that the earth is warming, climate change is real and is caused mostly by humans.
\
So who do you believe: the reputable scientists that actually study climate or, preyed off scientists, weathermen, graduate students in unrelated fields, fraudulent surveys and public relation firms that are hired by the fossil fuel industry?
\
Even if runaway global warming and climate change aren't caused by anthropogenic CO2, it is illogical and irrational to argue that continuing to pollute our atmosphere is a good thing, especially since there are renewable energy alternatives that don't get nearly the subsidies and tax breaks that fossil fuel gets.
\
It's not even a question of the environment at this point. It's a question of the future for our children and in the worst case scenario, the survival of our species. We can't stop human caused climate change because it's already started.
\
The devastating effects of climate change that will cause unprecedented suffering will only increase, unless people take the issue seriously, take a risk assessment, put a price on carbon by implementing a cap and trade program, divest in fossil fuel, invest in renewable energy, rid our media and government of invested interests that control them.
\
An important question is, when is the point of no return and have we passed it? Can we curb human desire fed by unbalanced free market capitalism that always wants more of a finite resource base that externalizes costs to the environment and condenses the wealth in the ever decreasing hands of the few at the expense of every living thing on earth?

"
88,"
I thank Republican State Chairman Monty Newman for his comments on my two columns concerning Steve Pearce. Dialogue and debate on these matters can only help all of us arrive at something like the truth.
\
Unfortunately, he chose to ignore my basic point: that while Mr. Pearce presented himself in Las Cruces as ""an environmental moderate"" he was no such thing. Whether you agree with him or not, he is toward the extreme, even among members of a conservative U.S. Congress, in voting against environmental protections. There are reasons he is consistently ranked so low by groups concerned with our environment.
\
Chairman Newman led off with some personal invective (taken in good spirits here), then listed some votes by Pearce (most unrelated to environmental concerns) and asked whether I found fault with them.
\
He cited a vote on the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, and asked whether I ""advocate for getting away with murdering an unborn child in killing a pregnant woman."" Uhh, no. I never even thought about advocating any such thing.
\
Leading off with that vote illustrates our different priorities. Executing a murderer twice, or sentencing him to prison for two lifetimes instead of one, might be very satisfying; but I care more about repairing this country's ill economy and polluted environment, getting people back to work, improving schools, making our system fairer, and the like.
\
He continued, ""Does Mr. Goodman support partial birth abortions, or does he believe that we should remove 'under God' from our pledge of allegiance."" Abortion deserves a separate column at some point - as an issue that provokes emotional responses and great divisiveness.
\
As to 'under God,"" which got added to the pledge in 1954, I don't much care. Those who like to say it or not say it should suit themselves. On balance, I'd stick with the original pledge, and the basic principle that church and state are separate. Public schools aren't for teaching kids to believe in gods or not to believe in gods.
\
These are the votes Chairman Newman leads off with in trying to defend Representative Pearce. Are these the highlights of Pearce's service in Congress? That'd be like a highlight film on a high school basketball player that shows him tying his shoes and tossing a sandwich wrapper toward a wastebasket.
\
The chairman also cites votes by Representative Pearce against the stimulus and against the cap and trade bill, as if they were unquestionably right.
\
Well, as a U.S. citizen and a New Mexican, I'd have voted against the war with Iraq, which was based on a lie and helped get us into the economic hot water we're in. I probably would have voted for the economic stimulus bill which, although it was watered-down in an attempt at bipartisanship, helped keep us out of either a full depression or a worse depression than we're in.
\
Of course Chairman Newman doesn't mention Rep. Pearce's vote on Feb. 17 against extending the payroll tax cut. Even when most Republicans realized the absurdity of their opposition to it, Pearce shouted ""Nay!"" It passed 293-132. While Rep. Pearce steadfastly opposes making billionaires like the Koch Brothers pay something closer to the tax rate any other civilized country would charge them, he says the deficit means we can't afford to extend the tax cut for less wealthy working folk. I'm not smart enough to follow that logic.
\
Chairman Newman also didn't mention Representative Pearce's recent votes to suspend the cross-state air pollution rule, to repeal energy efficiency standards for incandescent lightbulbs, to repeal EPA emissions regulations for cement manufacturers, for the Air Quality Impact of Drilling Act (weakening the Clean Air Act), and against repeal of certain funding restrictions on the ESA. The consistently anti-environmental slant of his voting record makes it misleading for Pearce to call himself ""an environmental moderate."" (Again, I don't say the oil and gas industry is always wrong, or that environmental protection advocates always right; but I do say that Representative Pearce (a) gets a bundle of money from oil and gas interests and (b) consistently votes against environmental protection advocates on just about everything.)
\
The chairman also took a familiar line more often taken in national affairs: that if I disagreed with him and with Mr. Pearce, I must not really be New Mexican. (Perhaps there'll be a legislative committee on un-New Mexican Affairs one day.)
\
In fact, a new survey suggests Mr. Pearce is the one who's out of step with New Mexico. A 2012 survey by The Colorado College found that a majority of New Mexicans disagree that ""We need to allow companies greater access to our natural resources, by ensuring them the ability to drill, mine, harvest timber, and extract other resources from our public lands"" and disagree that ""One of the best ways to create jobs is to cut back environmental regulations that are weighing down New Mexico businesses.""
\
The survey also asked, ""As part of efforts to improve the state economy and generate jobs as quickly as possible, some people have proposed reducing protections for land, air and water that apply to major industries. Would you prefer that New Mexico reduce protections for land, air and water that apply to major industries OR that New Mexico maintain protections for land, air, and water that apply to major industries."" New Mexicans answered ""maintain protections"" by 79 percent to 17 percent -- and another 1 percent, unprompted, said ""Increase protections.""
\
I'm a New Mexican and I love New Mexico. That's why I'd like to see it represented in Congress by the best possible people.

LAS CRUCES - They both come from Hobbs and they have both served in Congress. Those are the similarities between Republican Steve Pearce and Democrat Harry Teague who are vying for New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.
\
Teague, the incumbent, succeeded Pearce when Pearce ran for U.S. senator two years ago. That means southern New Mexico voters will be getting congressional experience, regardless of who wins the Nov. 2 election.
\
""I believe I understand what folks want from their representative - someone who will come and visit with them, work hard for them all the time, and be an independent voice for the hard-working families of southern New Mexico,"" Teague said. ""I am the right person to fight for southern New Mexico's working families, veterans, and small businesses, and to move New Mexico's economy forward with my 'Do it All, Do it in New Mexico' energy plan.""
\
Pearce, who served six years in the House, said, ""The people want a representative who reflects their values, and will focus on making government accountable to the people - not the other way around. As a businessman, I know what it takes to create jobs, and I know that the current Congress is killing jobs. We need a representative who will work to foster an environment for economic growth, and give the people a sense of security again.""
\
A priority to create jobs is also shared by the two candidates. But the differences begin in how to go about accomplishing that.
\
Pearce said job growth in southern New Mexico, and particularly Do-a Ana County, can be achieved through appropriate tax cuts and limiting regulations for employers. ""We're really making it difficult for small business to create jobs,"" Peace said.
\
Teague's job plan is to continue working with communities to invest in infrastructure and by creating jobs through the development of new energy technologies. ""... Drilling for more oil and gas, building nuclear facilities, massively expanding biofuels production, and capturing our wind, solar and geothermal resources,"" he said.
\
Teague's other top priorities include the practice of regularly returning to southern New Mexico to meet with constituents and listening to their concerns, ensuring border security, and providing for military veterans.
\
""Since being elected to Congress, I've returned to the district all but four weekends,"" Teague said. ""People made it pretty clear to me that they want a representative who will be there for them. I was elected to be their representative in Congress and it's important that I come back to hear from them so I can represent them properly.""
\
Pearce said if he returns to Congress his focus will be on getting the economy back on track, fighting for permanent tax relief, and paying down the nation's debt and deficit.
\
""We have to have productivity,"" Pearce said. ""Our market has been weaker than what's been represented. People's paychecks aren't stretching far enough.""
\
Pearce and Teague also differ philosophically on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, more commonly known as the stimulus bill, and the Troubled Assets Relief Program.
\
""The bailout was misguided,"" said Pearce, who voted against TARP. ""Government should not be asserting itself in the private market. The stimulus vote was a failed vote, and it's not going to work if we have to do it a second time. Americans want us to find the balance.""
\
Teague defended the legislation.
\
""We needed that,"" Teague said of the stimulus bill. ""That would have been another 2.4 to 2.8 million jobs lost if it hadn't been put into place. ... We can still see a lot of need. It would have been a much worse recession without the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.""
\
Pearce said the cap-and-trade energy bill would kill jobs. Teague, who voted for the bill, said it would create jobs in New Mexico if passed, and that protections were put in for the oil and gas industry.

92," * EPA, environmentalists say power plants need to reduce hazardous mercury emissions but don't agree how to do it\ There is general agreement on the need to reduce the mercury emissions from coal and oil-burning power plants.\ There is less agreement on the best way to accomplish that goal and what the target dates should be.\ A mercury emissions proposal made public by the Environmental Protection Agency in December infuriated environmental groups that considered it a rollback of plans unveiled during the Clinton administration.\ Critics contend that the new approach would delay major mercury reductions by 10 years and increase health risks because it allows the worst offenders to keep polluting.\ The EPA and Bush administration have argued that giving utilities more time to research and develop cheaper pollution-control technologies would help keep consumer costs down and could lead to better technology to capture the mercury, a toxic pollutant that settles over waterways.\ A fix is expensive, running into hundreds of millions of dollars to retrofit plants.\ That cost will ultimately find its way into light and heating bills.\ For example, PNM spent nearly $80 million to install equipment to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from its San Juan plant in 1998. PNM says it is still trying to estimate what it would cost to comply with the proposed mercury rules.\ But some argue that the health risks are significant. The EPA in 1998 branded mercury the nation's greatest public health risk of all the toxic pollutants it studied.\ The primary danger to humans comes from eating fish caught in rivers, lakes and reservoirs. When mercury pollution settles on water, it is converted into a more toxic form, methyl-mercury, which concentrates in fish tissue. People who eat such fish risk brain and nervous system damage, health officials say.\ New Mexico and 42 other states have issued advisories warning people to limit how often they eat fish, especially bass and walleye, from lakes, reservoirs and rivers, because the fish are contaminated with mercury.\ An EPA report in 1998 said exposure to mercury, even at low levels, was similar to the effects of lead, which causes health problems such as kidney, brain or nervous system damage, especially in children and fetuses.\ Coal and oil-burning power plants produce an estimated 40 percent of the nation's airborne mercury.\ The plan\ The EPA's new proposal outlines two possible methods to reduce the amount of power plant-produced mercury.\ The first option follows EPA's Clinton-era recommendation by requiring plants to install technology currently available to reduce mercury emissions.\ However, in its December proposal, the EPA set the required target of cutting annual emissions of mercury from the current 48 tons to 34 tons, a total of 29 percent, by the start of 2007.\ During Clinton's administration, the EPA predicted that mercury emissions could be reduced to 5 tons, or by about 90 percent, by the end of 2007.\ The 90 percent figure assumed that the technology was available to achieve that goal, EPA spokeswoman Cynthia Bergman. The agency revised the goal to 29 percent because ""we decided the 5-ton goal was not achievable by all plants,"" Bergman said.\ Under the second option in the new proposal, the EPA would drop the requirement to install pollution-control technology. Instead, the EPA would set a mandatory declining cap on mercury emissions. Utilities that own heavy polluting plants could purchase pollution credits from utilities whose plants emit less mercury. The EPA would fix the mercury emissions cap at 15 tons in 2018, to achieve a 70 percent reduction from the current level.\ Under this approach there is no requirement to install technology, but it makes clear that utilities must meet the cap. They have the flexibility to buy credits or research new technology, the EPA's Bergman said.\ Critics and supporters can file comments during a 60-day period, which began Jan. 30. In addition, the agency plans to hold a hearing in Philadelphia on Feb. 25-26.\ The EPA will consider changes based on the comments, then publish the rule before it becomes law.\ State's slate\ New Mexico's three coal-burning power plants produced 1,398 pounds of mercury in 2001, the most recent EPA figures available.\ PNM's San Juan plant near Farmington produced 751 pounds; Arizona Public Service company's Four Corners plant, also near Farmington, produced 621 pounds; and Tri-State Generation and Transmission's Escalante plant near Grants produced 27 pounds.\ Tri-State said existing pollution control equipment installed at its Escalante plant can reduce emissions enough to meet the proposed standard without modifications.\ PNM and Arizona Public Service said they will wait for the final rule before deciding how to reduce mercury emissions.\ ""Philosophically, I believe that well-designed cap and trade programs have demonstrated their effectiveness in obtaining more cost-effective emission reductions than regulatory command and control programs,"" said PNM's president, chairman and CEO, Jeff Sterba.\ PNM plans to file comments on both of the proposed options, he said.\ PNM and other Western plants face special challenges in trying to lower emissions.\ Coal burned at plants in the eastern United States emit oxidized mercury. That can be captured by technology used to cut sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, chemicals that produce smog and acid rain, said Nancy Norem, principal engineer in charge of compliance with air quality regulations at PNM's plants. That is the technology EPA cites when predicting attainable goals.\ However, mercury produced from coal at the San Juan plant is emitted in an elemental, or vapor, form that is harder to capture with that technology and can travel hundreds of miles, said Norem.\ There have been attempts to absorb mercury vapor emissions by using activated carbon, ""but the performance and cost is still unknown,"" said George Offen, senior technical leader for emissions and combustion products management at the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif.\ While that technology is being developed, utilities said the concept of credits to meet goals is a good idea. Such credits have been successful in reducing emissions that produce acid rain, Norem said, echoing Sterba's words.\ Regulation origins\ The push to curb emissions began with amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990. They required the EPA to study toxic air pollution from power plants to determine whether more regulations were needed to protect public health. In a 1998 report to Congress, the agency concluded that, of all toxic pollution, mercury posed the greatest concern to public health and set a timetable to release a proposed rule by the end of 2003.\ A study by the National Academy of Sciences in 2000 showed that up to 60,000 children each year may be affected by exposure to mercury in the womb.\ At about the same time, EPA concluded that available technology could reduce mercury emissions by up to 90 percent. But no rules were ever adopted.\ Critics condemn the new rules for falling far short of that target.\ ""We don't think it's a good thing. We're seeing a lot of these (types of) rules weakened under the Bush administration,"" said Jon Goldstein, spokesman for the New Mexico Environment Department.\ The new EPA proposal is gambling with people's health, said Jeanne Bassett, executive director of the New Mexico Public Interest Research Group.\ ""When we know something is a toxic chemical, why do we wait?"" she said.\ The Sierra Club has estimated that the EPA proposal will result in the release of nearly 300 tons of mercury emissions from power plants between 2008 and 2020 that could have been removed had the suggested target of 90 percent become the rule.\ ""I think that the Bush administration policies toward our environment -- be it air or water or public lands -- put our communities at risk,"" said Mary Wiper, associate representative at the New Mexico office of the Sierra Club.\ Some other states, including New Jersey and Massachusetts, plan to issue their own mercury emission rules that exceed the proposed federal standards. New Jersey's rule would require a 90 percent mercury reduction by 2007. Massachusetts would require an 85 percent reduction by 2006, and 95 percent by 2012.\ That route isn't open to New Mexico, where state law says air quality regulations can't be stricter than federal standards."

FARMINGTON - City councilors passed a resolution opposing two petitions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions ahead of hearings on one of the petitions scheduled to begin Monday. The resolution approved Tuesday night opposes an emissions cap program proposed by Santa Fe environmental group New Energy Economy and a cap-and-trade program brought forth by the New Mexico Environment Department.

SANTA FE (AP) -- A hearing over whether New Mexico should regulate greenhouse gas emissions is under way in Santa Fe, and the Environment Department has come out in support of repealing the state's cap-and-trade regulations. Agency attorney Ryan Flynn opened the hearing Tuesday by saying the battle over regulating carbon emissions is not a partisan one. The rules were approved last year by a state regulatory board in the waning weeks of former Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson's administration. While Republican Gov. Susana Martinez has been a vocal critic of the rules, Flynn points out that even the Democratic-controlled Legislature twice declined to pass legislation aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Flynn says repealing the rules would be in the best interest of the state and that the department can continue to protect air quality without the rules.

Our illustrious EIB (Environmental Improvement Board) has seen fit to create a regulation on pollution control that thumbs their collective noses at the people, businesses, and legislature of New Mexico -- a Cap and Trade regulation -- after many hearings around the state (at which there was overwhelming opposition), and after the legislature had twice voted down such rules. In plain language, they told the people and the legislature that they are in charge of our environment, so just sit down and shut up! Well, that ain't gonna happen at my house! Who do these punks think they are Chicago mobsters?
\
Oh, right: they are followers of our leader in the White House, so they can do anything they please.
\
I thought the people spoke loud and clear on what ""our"" representatives should do for us in the last election; apparently, these punks are too stupid to understand!
\
If allowed to take effect, this garbage will cost us all dearly -- I remember Obama saying during the campaign, ""This will necessarily increase our utility bills tremendously"". (And still so many fools voted for him!)
\
Funny, I haven't heard one single person standing on a corner screaming, ""My utility bills are too low!""
\
I call on our legislators to ""grow a pair"" and put this issue in the trash can permanently, where it belongs! Pollution can be controlled in other ways. What this regulation mainly does is create an ""industry"" to trade pollution credits, and control the fuel supply, thereby enriching the lucky few who are in control. And the consumers and businesses get to pay for it.

Public Service Company of New Mexico, the state's largest utility, also has argued that the program imposes costs on New Mexico other states don't have. \The Environmental Law Center on Thursday also filed a second petition that asks the New Mexico Supreme Court to order Martinez to allow the publication of new dairy regulations approved by the state Water Quality Control Commission.

98," Whether it's a vote of no confidence in Congress passing veto- proof bills on behalf of Earth's atmosphere, or simply recognition that the West can't wait for action from a federal government in Big Energy's hip pocket, New Mexico and some of our neighbors are taking matters into our own hands.\ Last week, our state, along with Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington and Utah, as well as the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Manitoba, agreed to set a goal for their region: reduced greenhouse-gas emissions by 2020.\ That might sound like big talk about far-in-the-future solutions to global warming -- but they're talking cleaner air in just over 12 years; a blink of an eye, really. And the idea isn't just to slow the growth of carbon emissions; it's to actuallly reduce them.\ Gov. Bill Richardson met with colleagues back in February to create the Western Climate Initiative. One of its major goals is a 15 percent reduction in the region's greenhouse-gas emissions from 2005 levels.\ Richardson and his environment secretary, Ron Curry, will work with their counterparts on many approaches to carbon reduction.\ The states-and-provinces group that gathered last week in Phoenix has given itself a year to figure out ways of reaching that 15 percent goal.\ One of the likely ways is a complicated system called ""cap-and- trade."" The states could put a limit, a cap, on the amount of pollutant an industry or its products -- cars, say -- can emit. Companies exceeding their caps would have to buy the right to do so from companies that come under the limit; that's where trade comes in.\ This is being worked out on the national level by a private- public organization called the Chicago Climate Exchange. Private- sector members include DuPont, IBM and Ford Motor Company; the state of New Mexico is one of the public members.\ Curry has been heavily involved in the climate exchange. Our state was first to join it. He'll likely take a lead in guiding the states and provinces through the intricacies of trading in pollution credits.\ We'll be curious to see how this works out. Meanwhile, we salute the United States and Canadian subdivisions who've agreed to pool their efforts. As Arizona's Gov. Janet Napolitano told the assembled experts and political leaders, the states need to act because the federal government ""is choosing to delay action.""\ Curry notes that the feds' laxity lies mainly with Bush administration regulators. He's encouraged by the great efforts at energy and conservation legislation being made by New Mexico's Sen. Jeff Bingaman. A House-Senate conference won't meet to resolve energy-bill differences until Congress reconvenes in September.\ It'll take dedication at the state and federal levels to turn back the tide of global warming -- so what was formalized in Phoenix is a laudable beginning."

LAS CRUCES - They both come from Hobbs and they have both served in Congress. Those are the similarities between Republican Steve Pearce and Democrat Harry Teague who are vying for New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.
\
Teague, the incumbent U.S. representative, succeeded Pearce when Pearce ran for U.S. senator two years ago. That means southern New Mexico voters will be getting congressional experience, regardless of who wins the Nov. 2 election.
\
""I believe I understand what folks want from their representative - someone who will come and visit with them, work hard for them all the time, and be an independent voice for the hard-working families of southern New Mexico,"" Teague said. ""I am the right person to fight for southern New Mexico's working families, veterans, and small businesses, and to move New Mexico's economy forward with my 'Do it All, Do it in New Mexico' energy plan.""Pearce, who served six years in the House, said, ""The people want a representative who reflects their values, and will focus on making government accountable to the people - not the other way around. As a businessman, I know what it takes to create jobs, and I know that the current Congress is killing jobs. We need a representative who will work to foster an environment for economic growth, and give the people a sense of security again.""A priority to create jobs is also shared by the two candidates. But the differences begin in how to go about accomplishing that.
\
Pearce said job growth in southern New Mexico, and particularly Do?a Ana County, can be achieved through appropriate tax cuts and limiting regulations for employers. ""We're really making it difficult for small business to create jobs,"" Peace said.
\
Teague's job plan is to continue working with local communities to invest in infrastructure and by creating jobs through the development of new energy technologies. "" Drilling for more oil and gas, building nuclear facilities, massively expanding biofuels production, and capturing our wind, solar and geothermal resources,"" he said.
\
Teague's other top priorities include the practice of regularly returning to southern New Mexico to meet with constituents and listening to their concerns, ensuring border security, and providing for military veterans.
\
""Since being elected to Congress, I've returned to the district all but four weekends,"" Teague said. ""People made it pretty clear to me that they want a representative who will be there for them. I was elected to be their representative in Congress and it's important that I come back to hear from them so I can represent them properly.""
\
Pearce said if he returns to Congress his focus will be on getting the economy back on track, fighting for permanent tax relief, and paying down the nation's debt and deficit.
\
""We have to have productivity,"" Pearce said. ""Our market has been weaker than what's been represented. People's paychecks aren't stretching far enough.""
\
Pearce and Teague also differ philosophically on American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, more commonly known as the stimulus bill, and the Troubled Assets Relief Program.
\
""The bailout was misguided,"" said Pearce, who voted against TARP. ""Government should not be asserting itself in the private market. the stimulus vote was a failed vote, and it's not going to work if we have to do it a second time. Americans want us to find the balance.""
\
Teague defended the legislation.
\
""We needed that,"" Teague said of the stimulus bill. ""That would have been another 2.4 to 2.8 million jobs lost if it hadn't been put into place. We can still see a lot of need. It would have been a much worse recession without the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.""
\
Pearce said the cap-and-trade energy bill would kill jobs. Teague, who voted for the bill, said it would create jobs in New Mexico if passed, and that protections were put in for the oil and gas industry.

Here's an axiom for political candidates: If possible campaign on the issues. If the issues favor your opponent attack his character. But if you don't have the issues and your opponent has impeccable character, invent lies and throw mud anyway.
\
Sadly, that's exactly where Harry Teague's campaign is today. He's wrong on every issue and Steve has impeccable character. So Teague's campaign is left to inventing lies and slinging mud.
\
Teague's most absurd lie is that Steve Pearce was a corrupt Congressman. Factcheck.org found this claim, based on a botched investigation by a liberal watchdog group, to be false. The House Committee on Standards of Conduct investigated the claim and sent Steve Pearce a letter dated October 11, 2007 stating he did not violate any ethics rules.
\
Teague also claims that Steve Pearce received extra benefit from the sale of his company, claiming he sold it for more than twice its stated value. Once again, factcheck.org exposed the lie. ""Stated value"" was merely the company's tax basis consisting of cost less depreciation, which has nothing to do with market value.
\
The amount the buyer, Key Energy Services, paid for Pearce's company was its actual current market value. There is nothing to suggest that this sale was anything other than a fair transaction between Steve Pearce and Key Energy.
\
The fact is, Harry Teague cannot hold a candle to Steve Pearce. Harry proved his vote is for sale when he exchanged an ""aye"" vote on cap and trade for a few trinkets with zero benefit for New Mexico.
\
CBS later caught him red-handed trying to sell his vote for the Health Care Bill. He quickly changed his mind and voted no, but only after Nancy Pelosi had secured the votes needed to pass the bill. Harry's allegiance isn't to us, but to progressive liberals like Nancy Pelosi.
\
Sending Harry back to Washington puts our Constitution and our liberty in peril.
\
Steve Pearce, on the other hand, would protect our nation, our freedom, and our Constitution. He believes unborn babies need legal protection. He opposes attempts by gays to destroy the fabric of our civilized society. He knows government can only create jobs by maintaining a healthy business environment, not with increased taxes and outrageous deficit spending.
\
This election is critical to our nation. We need Steve Pearce.

102,"\(Bloomberg) -- Canada's climate-change plan and other government measures are heaping costs on businesses and pushing them to a breaking point, the Chamber of Commerce says in a warning to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\Chamber President Perrin Beatty, in a letter Tuesday, asked Trudeau to find ways to cut business costs to offset the impact of an emissions plan that includes a minimum carbon price beginning next year. Failure to do so could mean “seriously undermining Canada's competitiveness,” he said.\“The cost of doing business in Canada is rising,” Beatty said in the letter, which was also sent to the country's provincial premiers. “Our members are deeply worried about their ability to both grow their businesses within Canada or compete for investment and customers from abroad.”\Environment Minister Catherine McKenna responded to the letter by saying the government is already “putting competitiveness and growth for the middle class at the heart of policy-making.” McKenna cited employment growth in the Canadian economy -- 350,000 jobs in the past 12 months -- while saying businesses are hiring “because they're confident in our plan” for growth. She thanked the Chamber for its “support for climate action.”\“The strongest economies of the next century will be those that nurture business transition and attract companies that want to invest in climate committed jurisdictions,” the minister said in a statement, adding she speaks often with businesses “who don't see this global shift as a competitiveness problem, but rather as a cutting-edge opportunity.”\‘Suffocate' Warning\A cocktail of new regulations, taxes, climate measures and pension changes are having a “serious cumulative impact,” Beatty said. The business community supports measures to tackle climate change but argues they should be accompanied by cutting costs elsewhere, he said. High labor costs, low productivity growth, electricity rates and employment insurance changes are also raising costs. “If we don't give Canadian businesses breathing room, many will suffocate,” Beatty added in a press release.\In Ontario, where the government recently announced a proposed increase of the minimum wage to C$15 per hour by 2019, the self-assurance of smaller firms has already been shaken. June data from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business shows the barometer index, a measure of business confidence, fell 10.2 points to 58, the biggest monthly decline since 2008. Nationally, the index dropped 5.2 points, the most in almost six years.\The proposed changes in Ontario drove the decrease in business sentiment across Canada, and are “adding considerable uncertainty over future operating conditions,” Ted Mallet, chief economist at the CFIB, said in the report.\The Chamber's warning comes ahead of upcoming negotiations on the North American Free Trade Agreement and amid U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to cut taxes and regulations. Canadian “concern becomes even more substantial when we see the determination of the U.S. administration to dramatically cut both regulation and business taxes in that country,” Beatty wrote.\Climate change is one of the foremost policy differences between Trump and Trudeau. The president pulled the U.S. out of the Paris agreement last month, while Trudeau continues to champion it at home and abroad.\“The solution is not to ignore climate change, but to proceed in a way that makes sense for Canada's economy,” Beatty said. “We believe that the negative impact of carbon pricing mechanisms on competitiveness can be minimized if they are designed with competitiveness in mind and offset by cost reductions in other areas.”\Trudeau's climate plan kicks in next year, though Canada's most populous provinces already have either a cap-and-trade regime or a carbon tax. Beatty urged Trudeau and the premiers to discuss competitiveness at their next meeting.\(Adds Canada government comment in fourth and fifth paragraph.)\To contact the reporters on this story: Josh Wingrove in Ottawa at jwingrove4@bloomberg.net, Erik Hertzberg in Ottawa at eschmitzhert@bloomberg.net.\To contact the editors responsible for this story: Theophilos Argitis at targitis@bloomberg.net, Chris Fournier, Stephen Wicary\cc2017 Bloomberg L.P.\Credit: Josh Wingrove and Erik Hertzberg"

A comment I used to hear a lot during Gary Johnson's two terms as governor was, ""Gary is just Gary.""
\
Gary being Gary made him an ineffective governor, but as a candidate for president? Bring him on! That's because, in these times of the coached, coifed and vacuum-sealed candidate with the entourage of handlers and spinners, the candidate who manages to be just himself is a breath of fresh air. When Johnson makes a statement, we know it's his honest opinion and not the product of focus groups and polls.
\
Johnson doesn't pander. His contribution to the next election cycle could be his willingness to tell us what we don't want to hear and challenge other candidates who take the easier path. That's either brash or brave.
\
The real irony in Johnson's campaign is that in not trying to be all things to all people, in just being Gary, he does offer a little something for everyone - after his own fashion. Always described as ""libertarian-leaning"" and not out-and-out libertarian, his smorgasbord of views will find support and brickbats across the political spectrum.
\
Johnson's positions, to date: He would cut taxes and shrink government, legalize marijuana, establish a guest-worker program for immigrants (who would pay income taxes and have health insurance), get out of Iraq and Afghanistan ""as soon as effectively possible."" He supports states' rights, abortion rights (but would leave abortion laws up to states), a clean environment (but not cap and trade), and civil unions for same-sex couples. He opposes the death penalty.
\
Blogging about the latest standoff in Washington, John-son said, ""We are facing a financial collapse under the weight of more than a trillion dollars in deficit spending, and Washing-ton is pretending to wage a budget battle royal over whether to cut spending by 1 percent or 2 percent."" In speeches, he's targeted Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and defense.
\
He's championed marijuana legalization since 1999. Recently, Johnson wrote that ""the current drug laws are contributing to an all-out war on our southern border all in the name of a modern-day prohibition that is no more logical or realistic than the one we abandoned 75 years ago."" We're fueling a massive black market economy and losing the drug wars, he says.
\
Johnson doesn't take the easy way out on immigration, either. ""Congress and the federal government have failed, due to political cowardice, to do anything meaningful about immigration reform,"" he wrote in a newspaper commentary. He wouldn't have signed Arizona's immigration law, but he understands the frustrations that produced the law, and thought the administration erred in its court challenge. Each state should work out problems its own way, he says.
\
""Someone needs to ask the obvious questions about why the federal government insists on doing so much, spending so much, and attempting to ultimately control so many local issues,"" he wrote.
\
Speaking in Hobbs last July, Johnson said that deporting 15 million illegal immigrants ""would be equivalent to an economic 9-11. They are here working, renting and buying.""
\
GOP candidates, he has said, want to keep throwing money at the war on terror and secure the borders ""when they don't seem to have any idea how much that would actually cost. Although the rhetoric sounds good, the reality of what they're saying really isn't going to reduce spending.""
\
On the Web site, Our America: The Gary Johnson Initiative _ ""You Say You Want a Revolution"" - he calls his campaign ""the liberty movement."" He's not expecting hugs from conservatives, but he believes his message will appeal to independent-minded Republicans, Independents and anybody else who's fed up.
\
And that's just Gary being Gary.

Almost a year ago, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott won a landslide election with a nearly single-issue campaign: repeal the carbon tax. On July 17, he made good on that promise, as the Australian Senate voted, 39 to 32, to abolish the ""world's biggest carbon tax"" -- a tax that was reported to ""do nothing to address global warming, apart from imposing high costs on the local economy.""
\
Australia was one of the first major countries, outside of the European Union, to adopt a carbon price -- first suggested in 2007 and passed under Labour Prime Minister Julia Gillard in 2011.
\
The Journal reports that when Australia's carbon tax was passed, the Brookings Institute ""described Australia as an 'Important laboratory and learning opportunity.'""
\
So, what do we learn from the ""laboratory"" the now-failed ""model legislation"" offered?
\
First, the Journal states: ""The public hates it."" The (U.K.) Telegraph calls the tax: ""one of the most unsuccessful in history"" and points out that it is ""unique in that it generated virtually no revenue for the Australian treasury due to its negative impact on productivity; contributed to the rising costs that have taken the gloss off the country's resources boom; and essentially helped to bring down Ms Gillard's former Government.""
\
The Telegraph, in an article titled: ""Australia abandons disastrous green tax on emissions,"" adds that the tax failed in ""winning over voters who faced higher costs passed on by the companies that had to pay for it.""
\
The Telegraph offers this summary: ""carbon trading mechanisms and green taxes have largely been a failure elsewhere and especially so in Europe where they have dragged on investment and threatened long-term energy security.""
\
These are important lessons in light of the renewed push for a carbon tax in the United States as evidenced by the partnership of President George W. Bush's Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and liberal billionaire Tom Steyer, who are, together, calling for a climate tax.
\
According to the Journal, the World Bank called Australia's repeal, ""one of the biggest international threats to the rollout of similar programs elsewhere."" The climate lobby is concerned as ""Australia's vote shows that the real obstacle to their dreams of controlling more of the world's economy is democratic consent.""
\
In the United States, similar efforts to reduce CO2 emissions by increasing costs to emitters, and therefore consumers -- in our case, cap and trade -- failed to achieve ""democratic consent"" even when Democrats had control. The people didn't want it. So, the Obama administration now is trying to go around Congress with onerous rules and regulations on emissions.
\
Jennifer Marohasy, Ph.D., who worked for 12 years as a scientist for the Queensland government, told me: ""In short, repeal of the carbon tax is a big symbolic win. But it's mostly just window-dressing: to appease the masses. In the background, proponents of anthropogenic global warming who dominate our political class still very much control the levers of government and intend to continue to terrorize the population with claims of catastrophic global warming, while consolidating their rent-seeking through the (Renewable Energy Target).""
\
May America learn from the ""important laboratory"" of Australia's foray into climate schemes.

ALBUQUERQUE -- A state judge delivered a setback Tuesday to an environmental group that is seeking a cap on greenhouse gas emissions in New Mexico.
\
Judge William Shoobridge granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting a state regulatory panel from continuing proceedings on a petition for the emissions cap until he rules on a lawsuit to stop that petition.
\
New Mexico's largest utility, four state lawmakers and other industry groups had sued in January to stop the state Environmental Improvement Board from considering New Energy Economy's petition.
\
The environmental group and the state board countered with a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, a move that was rejected Tuesday.
\
Public Service Company of New Mexico, one of the plaintiffs, considered the judge's injunction a big win.
\
""It will prevent unnecessary expense while the judge considers the merits of the case as to whether they (board members) have the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Don Brown, a spokesman for the utility.
\
New Mexico Environment Secretary Ron Curry said he was disappointed with Tuesday's ruling.
\
""This is an obvious infringement on executive authority. We will weigh our options in this case,"" he said.
\
New Energy Economy has vowed to appeal Tuesday's ruling.
\
""It is our democratic right to petition for the health of New Mexico ... but this ruling favored a bankrupt business-as-usual scenario,"" Mariel Nanasi, a senior policy adviser with New Energy Economy, said in a statement.
\
The group contends that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas development and coal-fired power plants are contributing to global warming, which it considers ""a nuisance"" that is harming New Mexicans.
\
New Energy Economy initially petitioned the regulatory board in December 2008 to impose a cap that would affect any business that emitted more than 10,000 metric tons of carbon emissions per year.
\
A revamped proposal submitted last month specified a phased-in program that would include only electricity generators and those in the oil and gas industry that emit more than 25,000 metric tons per year. It sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from those sources by 3 percent each year from levels set in 2010.
\
The petition includes offsets, as well as a limit on the amount companies would be required to spend to control emissions.
\
Critics argue that the emissions should be addressed by the federal government and a cap applying only to New Mexico businesses would put the state at a disadvantage.
\
Critics also question whether the Environmental Improvement Board has the authority to set an emissions cap.
\
New Energy Economy argues that the New Mexico Legislature created the board and authorized it to hold public hearings for the purpose of considering air pollution regulation and public welfare protection.
\
The board held a public hearing on the group's petition in March and dozens of people from around the state traveled to Santa Fe to testify. Additional hearings are planned this summer.
\
In a separate effort, Gov. Bill Richardson's administration plans to petition the board this summer for a greenhouse gas emissions cap-and-trade program. That effort also has drawn criticism, including from gubernatorial candidates on both sides of the aisle.

ALBUQUERQUE - Gov. Susana Martinez's administration defended itself Wednesday against allegations that it circumvented the law when it put the brakes on the publication of numerous pending and proposed rules in the state register, including new regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions across New Mexico.
\
The New Mexico Environmental Law Center claims in a lawsuit filed Tuesday with the state Supreme Court that the administration disregarded the law when it moved to halt the codification and printing of the greenhouse gas regulations, which were approved in December by state regulators and filed with the state records administrator. Without publication, the rules cannot become effective.
\
The law center petitioned the court on behalf of New Energy Economy, a nonprofit group that pushed for the greenhouse gas emissions cap. The center is asking the court to force Martinez and F. David Martin, whom she nominated to head the state Environment Department, to follow the law and have the regulations published.
\
Bruce Frederick, a staff attorney with the New Mexico Environmental Law Center, argues in the lawsuit that the emissions rules were adopted by the state Environmental Improvement Board and should not be considered as pending because they haven't been published in the register.
\
The lawsuit accuses Martinez, Martin and State Records Administrator Sandra Jaramillo of ""several unconstitutional and otherwise unlawful actions.""
\
""We are trying to uphold the rule of law and to ensure that the new governor and her staff follow it,"" Frederick said in a statement.
\
Martinez's office argues it is following the law and that an executive order issued by the governor on her first day in office calling for a 90-day review of pending and proposed rules does not violate the legal requirement that the State Records Center publish the rules ""in a timely manner.""
\
""The governor's office is adhering to this requirement, while properly reviewing this regulation pursuant to the executive order,"" Martinez spokesman Scott Darnell told The Associated Press. ""The executive order does not seek to avoid or cancel publication, nor does it seek to amend or repeal the rule.""
\
He added that the temporary postponement in publication will have no effect on the rule's application or implementation given that its effective date is Jan. 1, 2013 or later.
\
The Supreme Court has yet to take action on the law center's complaint.
\
The emissions rules in question are essentially a backup measure to regulations approved and published last year that allow the state to participate in a regional cap-and-trade program. Both measures call for large polluters such as coal-fired power plants and refineries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions each year from baseline levels.
\
Critics, including Martinez, expect the regulations to have a devastating impact on New Mexico's economy. The governor has referred to the rules as a ""cap and tax.""
\
In approving the rules, some members of the Environmental Improvement Board argued that health and environmental costs would be higher in the future if New Mexico failed to take a proactive approach to reining in greenhouse gases.
\
Aside from the emissions rules, the New Mexico Environmental Law Center said in its complaint that the administration's action has prevented the codification and publication of a total of 32 final rules. Those include rules aimed at preventing groundwater contamination by the dairy industry and numerous provisions adopted by the real estate and construction industries divisions.

With the dramatic elimination of Osama Bin Laden came an important psychological boost to the American people. There is a collective sense that there's nothing we cannot do if we set our minds to it. Along with that boost came an important upswing in President Obama's approval ratings. At 51 percent approval rating in his 10th quarter as president, he is a full 7 percentage points ahead of Ronald Reagan's approval rating in his 10th quarter. With that upswing comes the responsibility to use his recharged political capital to tackle our greatest national (and international) threat climate change and to take advantage of this opportunity to fuel a new green economy.
\
Clearly feeling optimistic, President Obama made an important speech about our energy future. Clean energy, he said, will help us out-compete and out-innovate the rest of the world. ""Clean-energy jobs are the jobs of the future. I don't want other countries to win the competition for these technologies and jobs. I want America to win that competition. I want America to win the future.""
\
So do we. That's why the president needs to use his replenished political capital and increased approval ratings to push Congress for comprehensive climate and energy legislation that holds oil companies accountable and reduces our dependence on oil while protecting the environment.
\
We need a National Climate Act implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The president should propose a stringent carbon tax or an economy-wide cap-and-trade program with stringent timetables over several decades. If Congress again fails to act, then use the EPA's rulemaking authority that the Supreme Court verified in 2007. Inaction is not an option.
\
We must implement a comprehensive clean-energy plan for high-quality jobs, economic growth, cleaner air, water and food, and for the reduced dependence on foreign oil that will come as a result. The sooner we pass such legislation, the sooner we build a thriving green economy ? and have the jobs and economic growth that will come with that thriving green economy.
\
Just over a year ago we had one of the world's largest oil spills in a region that a few years before had been torn apart by a catastrophic hurricane. During this past year we have seen the resounding defeat of climate legislation; a major turnover in Congress; the rise and now dominance of China in what had been our solar market to lose; the rise in credibility of climate deniers; an increase in extraordinary weather events; multiple countries experiencing the hottest year on record; and an unthinkable nuclear accident caused by a tsunami. Take the Mississippi River's recent flooding and ravaging the residential areas around it; and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's visit to Greenland coincided with a new report that revealed the ice cap is melting at devastatingly high levels much higher than earlier anticipated.
\
America is a ""can do"" nation with the persistence, tenacity and talent to succeed. It's time for the Administration and Congress to join the American people with the same kind of persistence, tenacity and talent to work to gain America's freedom from oil, regain our technological supremacy, and protect our natural resources.
\
Neither our economy nor our planet can afford any more delays.

108,"\(Bloomberg) -- Canada's climate-change plan and other government measures are heaping costs on businesses and pushing them to a breaking point, the Chamber of Commerce says in a warning to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\Chamber President Perrin Beatty, in a letter Tuesday, asked Trudeau to find ways to cut business costs to offset the impact of an emissions plan that includes a minimum carbon price beginning next year. Failure to do so could mean “seriously undermining Canada's competitiveness,” he said.\“The cost of doing business in Canada is rising,” Beatty said in the letter, which was also sent to the country's provincial premiers. “Our members are deeply worried about their ability to both grow their businesses within Canada or compete for investment and customers from abroad.”\Environment Minister Catherine McKenna responded to the letter by saying the government is already “putting competitiveness and growth for the middle class at the heart of policy-making.” McKenna cited employment growth in the Canadian economy -- 350,000 jobs in the past 12 months -- while saying businesses are hiring “because they're confident in our plan” for growth. She thanked the Chamber for its “support for climate action.”\“The strongest economies of the next century will be those that nurture business transition and attract companies that want to invest in climate committed jurisdictions,” the minister said in a statement, adding she speaks often with businesses “who don't see this global shift as a competitiveness problem, but rather as a cutting-edge opportunity.”\‘Suffocate' Warning\A cocktail of new regulations, taxes, climate measures and pension changes are having a “serious cumulative impact,” Beatty said. The business community supports measures to tackle climate change but argues they should be accompanied by cutting costs elsewhere, he said. High labor costs, low productivity growth, electricity rates and employment insurance changes are also raising costs. “If we don't give Canadian businesses breathing room, many will suffocate,” Beatty added in a press release.\In Ontario, where the government recently announced a proposed increase of the minimum wage to C$15 per hour by 2019, the self-assurance of smaller firms has already been shaken.

SANTA FE Elizabeth ""Beth"" Atkinson Ryan of Roswell, was appointed by Gov. Susana Martinez to the New Mexico Game and Fish Commission. This Commission's purpose is to conserve, regulate, propagate, and protect the wildlife and fish within the State using a flexible management system that ensures sustainable use for public food supply, recreation, and safety.
\
The Commission seeks to accomplish the State's comprehensive wildlife management goals. Ryan's excitement to serve on this Commission stems from her personal love for hunting and the outdoors. Ryan was raised since a young age to appreciate wildlife and its proper management in order to protect the species and its habitat. She is also a member of Safari Club International (SCI) and her local SCI chapter and of the National Rifleman's Association (NRA).
\
By way of background, Ryan just completed a four-year service on the state's Environmental Improvement Board (EIB), which is both an adjudicatory and appellate board under the administrative agency of the Environment Department of New Mexico, where she participated in the repeal of the cap and trade and greenhouse gas emissions regulations; approved a settlement among the state, EPA, and utility companies regarding several of their coal-fired plants in Northern New Mexico concerning regional haze rules; and passed rules concerning air quality, petroleum storage tanks, hazardous waste, liquid waste, and drinking water.
\
Her public meetings on the EIB were even interrupted by the Occupy Movement and protest groups. She has earned the respect of industry, environmental groups, and the media. Her term ended Dec. 31, 2014.
\
When not volunteering in these roles, Ryan is a partner at the law firm of Carson Ryan LLC, where she has an oil, gas, and energy practice. In this role, she manages a highly successful business, is responsible for finances, marketing, human resources, and provides legal and business advice to prestigious clientele.

FARMINGTON -- State legislators repealed one of New Mexico's two carbon cap-and-trade laws Feb. 6, and Farmington electric utility officials are hoping the second one will be repealed in March.
\
If so, it could mean a new natural gas power plant for the area, which would provide more power and an increase in revenue for the city.
\
In 2008, officials began planning a new natural gas plant before New Mexico became one of only a handful of states to pass strict carbon cap laws.
\
""Both of those rules required greenhouse gas reductions,"" said Farmington Electric Utility Director Maude Grantham-Richards. ""The only way to reduce emissions is to burn less gas. Every year it decreases.""
\
The laws required power plants to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released per megawatt hour by 3 percent per year. This level of reduction quickly would put any new power plant out of compliance.
\
Because the city would seek bonds for at least part of the plant, and bonds typically are issued for 20 years or longer, building a new natural gas plant under the old carbon cap regulations would be fiscally irresponsible, officials say.
\
""Based on the reduction's starting point, the plant would no longer meet requirements within eight years,"" Grantham-Richards said. ""That would mean we would have to start reducing capacity or buying carbon offsets.""
\
Buying offsets would mean an increase in what people pay for electricity.
\
""We are committed to keeping our customers' power bills as low as possible,"" Grantham-Richards said.
\
Even if the second carbon-cap rule is repealed in March, it is still uncertain what sort of new power generator the electric utility might build.
\
""Our intent would be to do so, but it isn't our decision,"" Grantham-Richards said. ""We would have to present options to the Council. We could buy, participate in more coal, nuclear or build natural gas. Those are the options.""
\
There are some definite bonuses to pursuing natural gas.
\
""There are a lot of reasons to use natural gas as far as the environment,"" said Mike Sims, the electric system's generation and system control manager. ""It's cleaner burning and has half the carbon dioxide footprint of coal. It also uses less water.""
\
The San Juan Basin has one of the largest deposits of natural gas in the country, and the infrastructure for retrieving and transporting it already is in place.
\
""We could take something that we produce locally and make it more valuable,"" said Farmington City Councilor Jason Sandel, who also is executive vice president of Aztec Well Servicing. ""Electricity is worth far more than natural gas.""
\
Sandel is a big supporter of the city building a new natural gas plant.
\
""Not only would it generate a lot of revenue for the city, it also could help us get away from coal,"" Sandel said. ""Owning part of San Juan Generating Station is going to cost the city a lot of money.""
\
The coal-fired plant is in the middle of an Environmental Protection Agency-required retrofit to reduce its emissions, a process that could cost the city $26 million.
\
Building a new natural gas plant wouldn't take away those costs. The city would still remain a part owner in the coal plant, but it could go a long way to helping defray them. They also wouldn't have to pursue further costly coal-generated power production.
\
When it comes to generating revenue, one of the options would be to build a larger plant that would allow the city to sell electricity to other utilities, something the city already does in very small amounts.
\
""We don't sell very much right now,"" Grantham-Richards said. ""We do not build facilities to make sales because our commitment is to our customers.""
\
The problem is that it's hard to predict how a community is going to grow.
\
""We build the facility based on predictions of future growth so there is always some power available for sale right after the facility is constructed,"" Grantham-Richards said. ""But as the community grows, that amount goes down. We aren't in the power business to take risks.""
\
Farmington's Electric Utility System gets its power from a variety of different sources.
\
""Utilities always look for diversity of fuels,"" Grantham-Richards said. ""Last year's cold spell made it so that all the gas facilities couldn't flow gas, which caused massive brownouts.""
\
In 2011, the city got 32.5 percent of its power from natural gas, 22 percent from coal, 17 percent from hydroelectric and 28 percent from purchasing.
\
Building a new plant won't be cheap. When the city built Bluffview Power Plant, it cost $60 million. To build a new plant at current prices would cost $100 million. The goal would be to build a plant similar to Bluffview that is a combined cycle plant.
\
""A combined cycle plant has gas and steam turbines together,"" Sims said. ""Both Animas and Bluffview are combined cycle plants.""
\
Natural gas power generation also requires far fewer employees, both in the plant and during extraction.
\
""San Juan Generating Station employs approximately 400 people,"" Sims said. ""And coal extraction also employs around 400 people. With natural gas, once the well is drilled, it doesn't take that many employees to keep it operating.""

113," On the politically sticky problem of climate change, Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., is trying to count to 60. Or maybe just 51.\ For two years, Bingaman has toiled in the slack backwaters of Congress trying to put together a workable piece of legislation to limit U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, linked to global climate change.\ With Republicans controlling Congress, there seemed little chance of a bill passing, but Bingaman studiously laid the groundwork.\ The issue moved out into the middle of a very fast-moving stream when Democrats took control of Congress in January.\ Now, with a realistic chance that a climate bill could pass this year, Bingaman can begin seriously counting votes -- 51 to pass in the Senate, 60 to hold off a filibuster. But lining up the votes does not seem to have gotten easier.\ On one side are industries like mining and petroleum whose bottom line could suffer with a greenhouse gas reduction bill that does too much. Economic analyses show that translates to higher consumer costs for things like electricity, fuel and consumer goods.\ On the other side are environmentalists, who say the potential damage from climate change is enormous, and who say Bingaman's attempt at compromise will do too little to stem the problem.\ Greenhouse gases from power plants and auto tailpipes trap heat near Earth's surface. Most climate scientists believe greenhouse gases have already raised global temperatures. Absent efforts to control their emissions, they could lead to significant and potentially damaging climate change over the next century, the scientists say.\ The results, according to scientists, include rising sea levels, threatening coastal communities, and shifting precipitation patterns, including a drier New Mexico.\ With the world's economies based on fossil fuels, the trick is to find a regulatory approach that reduces emissions without harming the U.S. or global economies, Bingaman said in a recent interview.\ ""I'm in favor of doing all we can do without adversely affecting the economy,"" Bingaman said.\ ""All we can,"" in Bingaman's approach, is modest. A draft bill circulated earlier this year places a cap of sorts on emissions, then lets industries buy and sell emission ""allowances."" Companies that do a better job cutting emissions can profit by selling allowances to companies with higher emissions.\ ""Most economists, I think, prefer a 'cap and trade,' '' Bingaman said.\ In that regard, Bingaman's bill is little different from four others making the congressional rounds.\ But the results would be different. The other bills set much more aggressive targets for emission reductions than Bingaman's.\ That has made Bingaman's approach unpopular among environmentalists, who think much tougher targets are necessary to stabilize carbon dioxide at a level that will not cause dangerous climate change. ""That's our litmus test for how good a bill is,"" said Jeanne Bassett, executive director of Environment New Mexico.\ Bingaman is not unsympathetic to the criticism. He himself has twice voted for much tougher bills. But in each case, the bill fell so far short of passage that Bingaman thinks a more middle-ofthe- road approach may be the only way to get legislation through Congress.\ Bassett and other environmentalists argue it would be better for Congress to do nothing this year than to pass Bingaman's bill. They are willing to wait for a new Congress and a new president following the 2008 election.\ ""You've got to just do it right from the beginning,"" Bassett said.\ That has created the seemingly contradictory situation that industry may be more willing to cut a deal now rather than face the uncertainty of a new president and Congress that might be willing to pass tougher laws.\ ""There are many that would have a solution now rather than a solution under a new White House,"" said Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, which represents coal producers.\ Popovich believes Democrats who long called for action on greenhouse gas reductions are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with their economic cost now that they are actually in a position to pass a bill.\ ""They're finding that the solutions that they espoused, almost fliply, are far more costly,"" Popovich said.\ Popovich's argument mirrors the White House's position. Action on climate change, President Bush said Monday, ""cannot hurt economic growth.""\ Finding agreement on an approach to greenhouse gas reductions is complicated by the increasingly partisan nature of the climate change issue, said Matthew Nisbet, a political scientist at American University in Washington, D.C.\ Polling data show Republicans are far less likely than Democrats to accept the mainstream scientific consensus on climate change, and are therefore far less likely to favor taking action, according to Nisbet.\ ""Global warming has joined issues like abortion, like gun control, like 'tough on crime,' '' Nisbet said.\ The partisan divisions are complicated by powerful Democrats from coal and auto industry states, said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group favoring stronger emission reductions than those favored by Bingaman.\ Bingaman plans to introduce a final version of his bill sometime later this month, and he said it is likely to propose tougher emission reduction targets than the current draft that has drawn so much opposition from environmentalists.\ He is working, the senator said, ""to try to get a bill that can get 60 votes."""

Editor's note: This week Art Ortiz, a native Taoseno and retired businessman, launches a monthly column on current events.
\
Ortiz is a veteran, having served in the army of occupation in Japan after World War II. He also served as commander of Post 5432 in Corrales, N.M. A graduate of the University of Wisconsin and the American Graduate School of International Management (Thunderbird) in Glendale, Ariz., he worked as sales manager and general manager of Quaker Oats Colombia and Quaker Oats Venezuela, respectively for 10 years.
\
Upon returning to Taos, Ortiz managed the family business, Yucca Builders Supply for three years, during which time he was also one of seven co-founders of Centinel Bank of Taos, where he later served as president for four years.
\
Ortiz also served as state planning director and state banking commissioner. When president of Western Bank Santa Fe he was elected by his peers as president of the New Mexico Bankers Association, only the second Hispanic to serve in the position in more than 50 years.
\
Now retired, Ortiz is chairman of the Taos County Planning Commission and vice-president of Taos Historic Museums Foundation.
\
A little research tells us that through the ages the earth has gone through periods of relative warmth and periods of relative cold. This before millions of cars were on our highways and hundreds of coal-powered plants operating all over the world. Why don't we believe that nature is just doing its thing?
\
All of us want to save the planet. We all want clean air and safe water and a healthy environment. But a major effort is going on to combat global warming as if it's a proven fact that it exists and is human caused, and we are doomed if we don't accept it as a proven fact. Yet, there is always another side of the story.
\
A Newsweek cover story dated April 28, 1975, and titled ""The Cooling World,"" blared out to the world: Because of ""ominous signs"" that ""the Earth's climate seems to be cooling down,"" meteorologists were ""almost unanimous"" that ""the trend will reduce agricultural productivity for the rest of the century"" perhaps triggering catastrophic famines.
\
Many of the same scientists trying to scare us to death about a new ice age in the '70s are now trying to scare us to death by telling us there is global warming and melting icebergs due to human-produced carbon dioxide (CO2). This is to result in grave calamities all over the world. (Should we believe them now?) Therefore, some say what is needed is a ""Sustainable World Society"" dedicated to forcing the developed world to ""reduce consumption and commit to binding and punitive limits on greenhouse emissions.""
\
This discussion in this article is timely, as representatives from 192 countries are currently meeting in Copenhagen for a summit on global warming, or as some prefer, climate change. However, as Jonah Goldberg, syndicated columnist wrote Dec. 7, ""This week's Copenhagen summit on climate change already seems doomed to failure, and voices on both sides of the global warming debate are trying to pin the blame on Climate gate.""
\
This latest gate is the result of computer hackers breaking into the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in England, downloading thousands of e-mail and other documents. Many of these discuss how to manipulate data that the scientists want to show the world. They conspired on how to ""trick"" us by ""hiding the decline"" in global temperatures since the 1960s.
\
Al Gore ran all over the world claiming that the world's scientists agree with his theory on global warming. This is totally false. As Cal Thomas, syndicated columnist, wrote March 29, 2009, ""There is a growing body of opinion that global warming is a fraud perpetrated by liberal politicians and their scientific acolytes who want more control over our lives.""
\
Gore refuses to debate anyone who disagrees with his theory. Why?
\
I believe that good, objective debate and discussion of the facts involving such a tremendous issue as global warming are healthy and necessary. If the alarmists are right, we are headed into super calamities that will forever change life on earth as we know it.
\
Dr. William Keller, a retired Los Alamos National Laboratory physicist, writes that, ""Greenhouse gas makes up about 2 percent of the total atmosphere while water vapor, a weak but important driver of climate change, makes up 96 percent of greenhouse gas. Co2 makes up about 3.5 percent of greenhouse gas.""
\
The most ambitious schemes of the Gore alarmists would only reduce this amount by maybe 20 percent over a long span of years. Certainly not worth destroying our economy with a ""Cap and Trade"" law. (More on this later.)
\
Also, the National Snow and Ice Data Center found that Arctic Sea ice expanded 13.2 percent in 2008, an area the size of Texas, 270,000 square miles. This disputes the contention that all the icebergs are melting.
\
Hertzberg, a physical chemist and retired Navy meteorologist, wrote, ""As a scientist and lifelong liberal Democrat, I find the constant regurgitation of the anecdotal, fear-mongering clap-trap about the human caused global warming to be a disservice to science.""
\
So, not all liberals believe Gore's clap-trap.
\
As a conservative observer of events, I agree with both Drs. Hertzberg and Keller. I beg our Congressional delegation to deliberate very carefully before signing on to draconian measures, based upon questionable science that can destroy our economy.
"
115," Tom Udall, cruising toward his fifth two-year term in the U.S. House of Representatives, sounds like he's part of a bipartisan establishment these days.\ ""The real work in the Congress is done in the committees,"" he said. ""I have reached across the aisle on all of the big issues that face us.""\ The Democratic incumbent set a record for spending on his first successful congressional campaign -- more than $1.5 million. So far this time, he's spent only a fifth of that -- $280,000 as of the end of August. More than half, he said, went to Democrats in less favorable positions -- $125,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and $30,000 to individuals challenging Republican incumbents in Arizona, Colorado and other Western states. His campaign chest still has more than $500,000.\ As state attorney general, 1991-98, Udall riled the petroleum, nuclear, alcohol and tobacco industries. He still often is at odds with these industries, but his rhetoric moderates as he holds out hope that Democrats will win back congressional majority on Nov. 7, giving him a shot at a leadership position.\ His standard stump speech includes his concern about global warming and his support of a ""cap and trade"" system, taxing carbon emissions but allowing pollution credits -- called ""allowances"" -- to be traded. Udall wants to ban oil-and-gas drilling in the Valle Vidal, which Pennzoil Corp. donated to the Carson National Forest in 1982. He wants to reform education, protect Social Security and improve health care. He said he would like to see the federal government create regional pilot programs for comprehensive health care, such as in Massachusetts.\ But no issue stands out more in this election than Iraq. Republican nominee Ron Dolin often starts out agreeing with Udall, then differs over details. For example, Dolin said Udall's proposal to withdraw troops would encourage terrorism.\ ""He's adopted the president's stay-the-course position,"" Udall said of Dolin. ""My position is we should begin a phased withdrawal - - a phased redeployment. ... Physically, it would take six months to get everybody out of there safely. The time is now for the Iraqi army and security people to stand up and take this over.""\ Udall said Dolin is ""dead wrong"" that international terrorists lead the Iraqi resistance. Udall said foreign fighters number only a few thousand. ""The rest of it is a local insurgency,"" he said. ""That's what's raging there now. That's what the top military people think is out of control. That's why they moved the forces into Baghdad.""\ Udall said he's not avoiding Dolin and has showed up at every forum to which he's been invited. In response to Dolin's charge that Udall skipped out on a forum in Las Vegas, N.M., Udall said he never saw an invitation.\ Regarding Dolin's charge that Udall sponsored a measure to allow illegal aliens to draw Social Security benefits when they return to Mexico, Udall says his opponent is mistaken. But he said Americans should realize that illegal workers pay $7 billion a year into the system that they can't recover -- alleviating some of the Social Security system's potential revenue shortfall as the population ages.\ Dolin also is mistaken, Udall said, about the congressman's vote on an Internet measure. He said he tried to amend a bill extending broadband systems into rural areas so there was ""no cost discrimination on the Internet,"" but the amendment was defeated.\ Udall said Dolin is right about his vote against a bill to require parental notification of minors who get abortions. ""It didn't have the judicial bypass provisions that are required by our Constitution and the courts,"" he said.\ Regarding Dolin's allegation that Udall should have known about resigned Florida Republican Congressman Mark Foley's sexual proclivities toward teenage boys who served as congressional pages, Udall said, ""I don't know how I would have known.""\ Dolin said his campaign is focused on the issues, not personalities.\ But his Web site calls political dynasties ""a cancer on representative democracy"" -- a reference to Udall's pioneer-Mormon family, once called ""The Kennedys of the West.""\ Tom Udall's father, Stewart Udall, 86, of Santa Fe was a congressman from Arizona, 1955-60, served as secretary of the interior under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, and subsequently has authored many books.\ Tom Udall's uncle, the late Morris Udall of Arizona, took over Stewart's seat in the House and stayed there until retiring 30 years later.\ Tom Udall's cousin, Morris' son, Mark Udall, is a congressman from Boulder, Colo.\ Tom Udall, 58, is married to Jill Z. Cooper, a lawyer who worked for four attorneys general in New Mexico, then served as secretary of the state Department of Cultural Affairs and remains her husband's closest adviser.\ They have no children together, but Cooper's daughter from a previous marriage, Amanda Cooper, joined the Udall family pursuit of politics by working on her stepfather's early, unsuccessful campaigns. This year, she manages Gov. Bill Richardson's re- election campaign.\ Asked how he has changed over seven and a half years in the U.S. House, Udall said, ""I've learned more and become a more effective congressman. ... Friendships in Congress are important, especially friendships on the other side of the aisle.""\ TOM UDALL\ Party: Democrat\ Age: 58 (Born May 18, 1948, in Tucson, Ariz.)\ Residence: Santa Fe\ Education: Bachelor's degree in government and political science, Prescott College, 1970; bachelor's degree in law, Cambridge University, England, 1975; law degree, University of NewMexico, 1977\ Occupation: Lawyer serving in Congress\ Experience: U.S. House of Representatives, 1999-present; New Mexico attorney general, 1991-1998; candidate for Congress, 1988; chief counsel, state Health and Environment Department, 1983-1984; Assistant U.S. attorney, 1978-1981\ Family: Wife, Jill Z.

Rep. Harry Teague toured John Kloepper's solar project north of Alamogordo Monday afternoon, and Kloepper told the congressman the woes of doing business with PNM.
\
Teague listened intently and asked several questions throughout the tour.
\
Several others joined Kloepper on the tour, including Alamogordo City Commissioner Robert Rentschler, author Lyn Buchanan and New Mexico State University-Alamogordo instructor Clay Blevins.
\
Kloepper said he had been in contact with Teague about opening up the New Mexico carbon credit/renewable energy credit market, and Teague's office contacted him Friday to set up a tour of Kloepper's solar project.
\
Kloepper said he's gone to Santa Fe to the state Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department as well as written Gov. Bill Richardson about fostering REC sales in New Mexico, so Kloepper and others who produce green energy could sell their RECs on the open market rather than rely on PNM to buy RECs. He said he hopes to see change at the state level.
\
Buchanan said PNM gets all the RECs customers generate, and they will thank those customers by raising rates to pay for the over $200 million needed to meet standards the governor set to get 20 percent of their energy from renewable sources by the year 2020.
\
""So, you know, right now the little guy is just walking around with a target on his back,"" Buchanan said.
\
Rentschler said the energy situation in New Mexico could get drastically worse before long. He said last week the state Supreme Court decided the state Environment Department could invoke New Mexico's own version of cap and trade.
\
""So we could see New Mexico's gas and power go up 20, 30 percent and watch our neighbors in Texas and Arizona stay level,"" Rentschler said.
\
Kloepper's fiancee, Andrea Humpert, said it would be nice if locals could build solar fields and profit from them rather than watch big companies from out of state come in and do it.
\
""If a California company comes in, the majority of the profits are going to go back to (California),"" Humpert said.
\
Blevins, who is teaching a new class at NMSU-A on how to install solar systems, said his students won't stay in Alamogordo but will leave town because there is no business here and no work for them, which is a problem that has plagued New Mexico for a long time.
\
Kloepper said New Mexico is working with other Western states to develop the Western Climate Initiative, but progress is slow. He said the Western Climate Initiative would enable New Mexicans to trade their RECs on the open market like people in several Eastern states can, and New Mexicans could break free of PNM's shackles. Kloepper said PNM pays 13 cents per REC, which represents one kilowatt hour of power generated by a solar system. He said the average traded value of a REC in most of the U.S. is about 30 cents.
\
Teague said he and other representatives talked about RECs at the energy conferences when it was first brought to their attention and they're checking into it more. He said if it would not infringe on states' rights, perhaps Congress should change some legislation to open up REC incentives to smaller operators like Kloepper, not just big business.
\
Kloepper also talked to Teague about PNM's unfortunate generate and consume policy. Kloepper explained PNM wants to implement a policy to pay a residential customer with a photovoltaic solar system for RECs the person generates only if the person also consumes the corresponding amount of energy in the same month. He said the policy will also not credit customers for excess power generated. Kloepper said the policy will either encourage customers with solar systems to waste energy or will steal from those customers.
\
Kloepper said PNM currently credits residential customers for excess power generated, which can then be applied to their bills during the winter months when they generate less solar power. PNM also sends checks to customers for the RECs they produce.
\
Kloepper, who owns and manages Desert View Trailer Park on South Florida Avenue with Humpert, also has a residential photovoltaic solar system that powers their home and about everything they need to do around the trailer park. He said their plan for the solar project north of town has always been to sell power to PNM at wholesale cost, but since the project is a little bigger than a residential system, PNM applies its generate and consume policy. The panels currently erected at the site generate enough to power one and a half average homes, but Kloepper and Humpert had planned to build a solar field that would generate enough for 90 to 100 homes.
\
Kloepper said when he discussed the project with PNM vice president Ron Darnell, Darnell told him PNM had no provision in its business plan to accommodate such a project.
\
""I said, 'Hey Ron, I'm going to have to burn power in place if you can't accommodate me.' He said, 'You gotta do what you gotta do' and walked away,"" Kloepper told Teague. ""PNM is the monopoly. I can't work with a monopoly if that's their attitude, you know?""
\
Buchanan remarked that PNM ""ruins the spirit"" of going green.
\
""A lot of people would like to do solar, would like to go green and all that,"" Buchanan said. ""But if you have somebody like PNM that's just discouraging the whole process for the little guy ... there are a lot of people who would like to help and the roadblocks are there. If large companies can't make money off of it then it's not going to happen.""
\
Kloepper said he set up a system to waste power in a small building at the site in order to recoup the value of his RECs from PNM, and showed the system to Teague. He explained a water heater heats 30 gallons of water to about 120 degrees, then the water is circulated through 450 feet of garden hose inside a refrigerator to cool back down and is then piped back into the water heater. The process repeats 12 times per day.
\
Kloepper has posted photos and comments about his project at www.pbase.com/shelka04/pnm.
\
""The thing that makes this really hard to stomach is because the power is being burned on site, and PNM is basically just sending me a check for the REC,"" Kloepper said. ""That money is coming from somewhere, and it's coming from the rate payers in town.""
\
Kloepper said he has the resources to build out his project to the planned size, enough to power 100 homes, but he can't stand the thought of having to waste that much power to recoup his RECs from PNM instead of putting the power on the grid for other customers to use.
\
Kloepper mentioned he hasn't had a bill from PNM since March. He estimates PNM owes him about $200 for his RECs. When he called PNM recently to ask where his bill was, he was told they have now put him on a 60-day billing cycle.
\
""It's funny, if I owed them money, they could shut off my power,"" Kloepper said. ""But if they owe me money, they can put me on a different billing cycle and get really hard to get a hold of.""
\
Blevins mentioned his class at NMSU-A, introduction to solar energy, teaches students how to install photovoltaic systems and how much they cost. He said NMSU-A will offer certificates for solar installation, and eventually degrees. He said many students are studying to become electricians, but anyone can take the class and learn to install a solar system.
\
""You can do a lot,"" Blevins said. ""You can be off the grid, and generate just for yourself in your house.""

"
122," President-elect George W. Bush faces a unique opportunity to break the political deadlock on the climate-change issue by developing a set of policies that will establish U.S. leadership on the most important global environmental issue of our time.\ The key to Bush's opportunity is the trust and confidence that he enjoys within the U.S. business community. His well-earned reputation as a ""friend of business"" gives Bush a degree of leverage on the climate change issue that an environmental activist such as Vice President Gore could never have. A ""breakthrough"" on the climate- change issue could enable Bush to use a traditionally Democratic issue to hold the center against attacks from the left in the same manner that President Clinton used welfare reform to hold the center against attacks from the right. Will and imagination are all that is needed.\ There are many reasons why this proposal might appear far- fetched. Bush has not demonstrated much interest in the climate- change issue in the past. He started his business career by founding an oil-drilling company and remains close to the oil industry, which has traditionally resisted stronger U.S. policies to reduce carbon emissions. The Republican leadership in Congress remains strongly opposed to the Kyoto Protocol, which it regards as threatening to U.S. economic interests and associates with Vice President Gore's activist environmental agenda. Bush's record as governor of Texas does not suggest great concern with environmental issues in general or willingness to put pressure on industry to reduce pollution.\ None of the above reasons should be dispositive, however, in the face of the political realities of climate change. There is no longer any reasonable scientific doubt that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from human activity are trapping additional heat in the atmosphere. Nor is there any reasonable doubt that this additional heat is beginning to affect our climate and will, over time, cause disruptive changes such as melting ice sheets, sea-level rise, more frequent and destructive storms, changes in rain patterns and the spread of disease vectors. This solidifying scientific consensus is reflected in opinion polls showing that a substantial majority of Americans believe that climate change is a serious problem and that the U.S. should show leadership in addressing it.\ Domestic pressure for action on climate change will be accompanied by increasing international pressure on the United States to honor its international commitments by reducing emissions at home. The bargain struck at Kyoto in 1997 contains three critical elements: ambitious short-term emissions-reduction targets for the developed countries (7 percent below 1990 levels in the case of the U.S.); emissions trading and other ""flexibility mechanisms"" designed to make it easier for the United States and other developed countries to meet their short-term targets; and the absence of any binding emissions reduction commitments by developing countries. The specific rules for implementing the basic Kyoto bargain were left to future meetings of the parties, the last of which was concluded unsuccessfully in the Hague in November.\ Two basic problems affecting the ability of the United States to carry out its side of the Kyoto bargain have arisen since 1997. The first is the insistence by the European countries that the U.S. achieve at least half of its required emission reductions by cutting domestic emissions as opposed to buying emission reductions from other countries. The second is the refusal of China, India or other developing countries to accept any binding commitments to reduce their own emissions. The Clinton administration has resisted the Europeans on the first issue because it believes that the Congress would never support the policy changes required to achieve the necessary domestic cuts. The Congress has made it clear, in turn, that it will not ratify the Kyoto Protocol unless it provides for ""meaningful participation"" by key developing countries. Finally, there is little chance of getting emissions-reduction commitments out of the developing countries unless the U.S. commits to stronger action at home.\ President-elect Bush will have to find a way out of this ""chicken and egg"" dilemma if the U.S. is to avoid being blamed for blocking an effective international response to climate change. Some of his advisers may tell him to simply walk away from the whole Kyoto exercise and do whatever appears most consistent with U.S. economic and Republican political interests. This would be a mistake. Walking away from Kyoto would subject the Bush administration to increasing diplomatic isolation and opprobrium that would undercut its ability to achieve other diplomatic objectives. This diplomatic failure would increasingly feed back into U.S. domestic politics by giving the environmental community and the Democrats a political issue to discredit Bush and the Republicans.\ Bush therefore has a strong political motivation to develop a set of climate-change policies that will enable him to seize the political offensive. What should be the key characteristics of such policies? First, they should minimize the use of command-and-control regulation and maximize the use of market instruments. Second, they should give producers and consumers as much flexibility as possible to choose the most cost-effective options for reducing or offsetting greenhouse gas emissions. Third, they should provide maximum scope for initiatives by state and local government and the private sector. Finally, they should openly recognize the role of the federal government in setting overall goals for net emissions reductions, providing an overall policy framework for achieving those goals and using federal enforcement authority to ensure that the goals are met.\ What policies might have those characteristics? The most important is a ""cap and trade"" system for emissions reductions. Under such a system, the Congress would establish a ceiling for total U.S. net emissions during a given time period, allocate that amount among prospective emitters in the form of emissions allowances, and allow those emitters to trade allowances among themselves. Such a system was established for reducing U.S. sulfur-dioxide emissions by Gov. Bush's father and has worked extremely well, achieving its goals at a much lower economic cost than expected and with almost perfect compliance. Another such policy would be to provide tax and other incentives for the purchase of low-emitting vehicles and other products and matching disincentives for the purchase of high- emitting products. Such ""point of purchase"" incentives have proven effective in the past and would be more politically acceptable than higher fuel or energy taxes.\ Another aspect of the climate change issue that invites creative policymaking is the relationship between reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and reducing emissions of conventional pollutants such as fine particles, ozone, oxides of nitrogen, sulfur and mercury. New EPA regulations and air-quality standards designed to reduce emissions of these conventional pollutants are imposing an increasing economic burden on coal-fired power plants, oil refiners and vehicle producers. Since the combustion of coal and oil is also the primary source of carbon emissions, these enterprises have an incentive to consider a ""grand bargain,"" under which they would get limited regulatory relief on conventional pollutants in return for commitments to reduce their carbon emissions.\ In order to break out of the ""chicken and egg"" dilemma referred to above, it is important that Bush establish clear domestic emission reduction goals and realistic policies for achieving these goals before attempting to finalize an international agreement through the Kyoto process. Strong domestic emissions-reduction policies are necessary to give the U.S. the credibility it needs to persuade the Europeans to be flexible on how to achieve Kyoto targets and to persuade the developing countries to make sufficient commitments on reducing their own emissions to gain Senate ratification of an eventual treaty. Bush should ask for treaty provisions that will give the U.S. more time to achieve its Kyoto target, but he will have to earn them through stronger domestic policies.\ Bush has a strong tradition of Republican environmentalism to build on as he addresses the challenge of climate change. Richard Nixon established the EPA and gave it much of its legal authority. William Ruckelshouse and Russell Train established its ability to enforce environmental laws against powerful polluters. Gov. Bush's father tackled the problem of acid rain and signed the Framework Convention on Climate Change on which the Kyoto Protocol is based. Even Ronald Reagan asserted U.S. leadership in negotiating the Montreal Protocol on ozone-depleting substances, one of the most successful multilateral environmental agreements ever created. All of these men were Republicans.\ Despite this tradition, it will not be easy for President-elect Bush to find the political will to pursue the course suggested above, given his past history and current attitudes within his party. But in the end he may have little choice. The climate change issue is not going away. The diplomatic and political costs of U.S. inaction will steadily increase. And, on the positive side, climate change offers Bush a possibility for leadership that could transform his presidency. It presents Bush with a unique ""Nixon in China"" opportunity on the environment. He would be foolish to pass it up.\ William A.

123," Running a profit-oriented utility while publicly advocating mandatory restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions seems hopelessly in conflict.\ But PNM Resources chairman, president and CEO Jeff Sterba told the Journal recently the contradiction is more apparent than real.\ Sterba -- whose company has clashed with the Public Regulation Commission this summer over an energy conservation program and two requests for rate increases -- said planning for the future of a utility in a world where limits on carbon dioxide emissions will soon be widely accepted requires taking positions that only seem contradictory.\ Q: Under your leadership, PNM was a founding member of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, a coalition of businesses and environmental groups that advocates mandatory limits on carbon emissions. But, in March you and several other utility executives announced that such restrictions could damage utilities and raise costs throughout the economy. Isn't that a contradiction?\ Sterba: There's no contradiction at all. Frankly, I can clearly believe that you've got to do things that may increase costs. But you've got to do them with eyes wide open, and recognize that one, they will have cost implications, and two, the magnitude of the cost increases is a function of what gets implemented.\ I believe in a slow, stop and reduce strategy, and that's what USCAP is about. Slow the rate of increase (of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) by 2020, stop the rate of increase, then start to decline it.\ Q: Doesn't that just delay cutting the amount of greenhouse gases going into the air?\ A: If we try to just decline, as some proposals have been, the only thing I could do to make sure I still served my customers, would be to cut back on coal generation and pick up natural gas generation. That's going to be much more expensive and the cost to the economy could be dramatic. If utilities pick up significant generation of gas, we would add a serious load to the natural gas demand in the country.""\ Q: So how do you believe limits on carbon dioxide should be done?\ A: In my judgment, you want to be careful what mechanism is used. I tend to favor a cap and trade system, but it's got to be economy wide. Otherwise, you don't get the lowest cost options.\ The point of regulation would be upstream, where the fuel enters into the economic cycle. So, with natural gas it could be at the point where natural gas comes into the pipeline. On the coal side, it could be at the coal mine, so that it would increase the cost of coal, or at the utility.\ The market would set a price on the basis of who's buying and selling and, if you're a manufacturer, you could see what the price of carbon was and decide whether it was cheaper to buy carbon allowances on the market or to do things in your system to reduce your carbon footprint. A lot of times, you would be able to reduce your carbon footprint, at a lower cost, and then sell your allowances.""\ Q: A system very similar to that has been successful at cutting emissions of sulfur dioxide, which cause acid rain.\ A: That's how markets operate, and they can be very effective. But, they're not simple. These are complex systems, particularly when you move to the scale of carbon emissions. It's a bit more of a challenge, because we don't necessarily have the technologies today.\ That's why I and some others advocate the use of what's called a safety valve, which has been incorporated into legislation proposed by Sen. Jeff Bingaman.\ What it says is the government will set a cap on the price of carbon, which will escalate at a predefined rate. It will issue allowances at that price. So, if the market price looks like it's going above that, then you can buy allowances in the near term at this safety valve price. It provides protection from a shock to the economy and it provides some predictability for those of us who are going to operate under the carbon constrained system.\ That's one of my real motivations for supporting a mandatory constraint. It's a huge uncertainty, but it's the right thing to do, and the sooner we impose it, the better we'll all be. We'll be able to hold costs down much better by knowing what kind of system we have.\ Q: In previous discussions, you've said modern nuclear technology could be part of PNM's suite of tools for addressing global warming. Is PNM thinking about using more nuclear?\ A: We certainly are thinking about using more nuclear. If we didn't have Palo Verde, and our coal resources, we would not have been able to do what we've done with rates for customers. But, if we started building a nuclear plant today, even if it was on an existing site, it would still be 10 to 12 years away. So the earliest you could get one in today would be in the 2017 window. Probably, we will be evaluating nuclear resource additions in the 2020 time frame. Nuclear expansion on the regulated side obviously would require the approval of the PRC.\ I tend to think there are some other things we're going to be doing in the intermediate time.\ Q: Such as what?\ A: Well, we have a naturalgas-combined-cycle facility that's in the final throes of construction near Las Cruces. It will be in service next year. We have signed an agreement for the construction of a small combustion turbine plant near Belen, scheduled for completion in June 2008. It will be 130 megawatts and powered by natural gas.\ We've launched a study, with the technological assessment and site assessment for a large-scale, concentrating solar project. If we find a technology that will work and we find a site that will work and we get comfortable with the economics, it could be in service by 2011 to 2012.\ We're also looking at an integrated-gasification combined cycle facility. What IGCC does is take coal through a gasifier, a chemical process to turn it into a gas, then it uses that gas to fire a regular turbine. IGCC by itself doesn't do anything about carbon. But, it will potentially allow you to strip the carbon out more cost effectively before you combust the gas. Then you're looking at a turbine that's burning hydrogen, not carbon. So, we're looking at a jointly developed project that would include carbon capture and sequestration. IGCC is very complicated. To do an initial study is $25 million.\ Q: Ben Luce, former director of the New Mexico Coalition for Clean, Affordable Energy, has charged PNM cut inside deals with the Richardson administration to soften the effects of energy legislation, particularly renewable energy legislation, in the last session. Is that true?\ A: PNM is engaged in the legislative process and we make our position on energy issues well known. It's part of the collaborative process and we feel many voices were heard this last session in addition to our own.\ Q: In the case of Senate Bill 418, which enlarged the renewable energy-use requirement for utilities to 20 percent of retail sales by 2020, Luce charges PNM's influence led to a reduction of the final energy-use target and to a failure to specify the deadlines for renewable energy use increases required to meet the 2020 target. How do you respond to that?\ A: Early in the legislative process, the governor's office convened a group of stakeholders, including electric utilities, CCAE, the Natural Resources Defense Council and others, including the Public Regulation Commission, the Environment Department and the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. Everyone had input and the two bills that passed the Legislature were the result of that collaborative process.""\ Q: While writing the rules that will put SB 418 into action, the PRC also rewrote the requirement for the amounts and types of renewable energy utilities must use. Now, instead of picking and choosing from a menu of renewable sources, like solar, wind or biomass power, with each of the sources given different numbers of credits to encourage companies to use them, utilities will be required to adopt a fixed percentage of each source. What's your reaction to these new rules?\ A: We're still studying the new renewable energy portfolio standard, but we're concerned that its technologyspecific mandates could further increase costs for customers at a time when the other costs of running our system are already rising.\ To minimize the impact on customers, we ideally would make such investments as each technology matures to the point where its cost starts to come down.\ Also, we need to remember that while our electric demand is growing quickly, New Mexico, compared to other states, has a relatively small population and a relatively small electric load. This makes getting affordable scale on expensive technologies challenging. Ultimately, letting the market guide us on how and when we make investments will produce a better price for customers.\ Q: Is there any good reason a company would avoid adopting a wide variety of renewable resources?\ A: Sure. Cost would be one reason. Technology infancy would be another. We would like to diversify away from just wind and a very small amount of solar right now, but it's got to be done with an eye toward economy. At the end of the day someone's got to pay the bill.\ Q: In a speech at a shareholders' meeting this summer, you said that, instead of being rewarded just for increasing capacity, utilities should be rewarded for meeting customers' needs, whether that meant building a new plant or investing in devices to reduce energy use. How would you actually put that into effect?\ A: There are a couple of different mechanisms. One is, what if tomorrow we get into the rate base the money we spend to help customers reduce use? By investing on their side of the meter, by investing in technology. There are a lot of things. Another way could be what's called the ""avoided cost concept."" What is our cost of building facilities to meet growing demand? Let's say it's 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. Let's take a percentage of that, say 9 cents per kilowatt-hour. The utility gets 9 cents per kilowatt-hour for every kilowatt hour it helps customers avoid using through energy efficiency. You could call them ""savowatts""; instead of selling them megawatts, we're saving a watt.\ Q: Is that the way utility companies are going to have to think between now and the end of the century?\ A: Oh, I don't think ""have to."" Some can decide to keep doing what they've always done. It's not, to me, what makes sense from the customer's perspective."

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A look at where Democratic President Barack Obama and Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney stand on a selection of issues: ABORTION and BIRTH CONTROL: Obama: Supports abortion rights. Health care law requires contraceptives to be available for free for women enrolled in workplace health plans, including access to morning-after pill, which does not terminate a pregnancy but is considered tantamount to an abortion pill by some religious conservatives. Supported requiring girls 16 and under to get a prescription for the morning-after pill, available without a prescription for older women. Romney: Opposes abortion rights. Previously supported them. Says state law should guide abortion rights, and Roe v. Wade should be reversed by a future Supreme Court. But says Roe vs. Wade is law of the land until that happens, and should not be challenged by federal legislation seeking to overturn abortion rights affirmed by that court decision. ""So I would live within the law, within the Constitution as I understand it, without creating a constitutional crisis. But I do believe Roe v. Wade should be reversed to allow states to make that decision."" Said he would end federal aid to Planned Parenthood. DEBT: Obama: A fourth-straight year of trillion-dollar deficits is projected. Federal spending is estimated at 23.5 percent of gross domestic product this year, up from about 20 percent in previous administration, and is forecast to decline to 21.8 percent by 2016. Won approval to raise debt limit to avoid default. Calls for tackling the debt with a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases. Central to Obama's plan is to let Bush-era tax cuts expire for couples making more than $250,000. That would generate more than $700 billion over 10 years. Also, would set a 30 percent tax rate on taxpayers making more than $1 million, increasing taxes for some but not all millionaires and billionaires. That would generate about $47 billion over 10 years. Reached agreement with congressional Republicans to cut $487 billion in military spending over a decade. Romney: Defended 2008 bailout of financial institutions as a necessary step to avoid the system's collapse, opposed the bailout of General Motors and Chrysler and said any such aid should not single out specific companies. Would cap federal spending at 20 percent of gross domestic product by end of first term. Stayed silent on the debt-ceiling deal during its negotiation, only announcing his opposition to the final agreement shortly before lawmakers voted on it. Instead, endorsed GOP ""cut, cap and balance"" bill that had no chance of enactment. Favors constitutional balanced budget amendment. Proposes broad but largely unspecified cuts in federal spending. Among the few details: 10 percent cut in federal workforce, elimination of $1.6 billion in Amtrak subsidies and cuts of $600 million in support for the arts and broadcasting. ECONOMY: Obama: Term marked by high unemployment, a deep recession that began in previous administration and officially ended within six months, and gradual recovery with persistently high jobless rates. Unemployment rate jumped to 8.3 percent from 7.8 percent in February 2009, Obama's first full month in office, and has remained above 8 percent ever since. The 38-month stretch of unemployment above 8 percent is the longest on records dating to 1948. But employers have added 3.6 million jobs since job creation turned steadily positive in March 2010. Businesses have added jobs for 25 straight months, pushing down the unemployment rate from 9.8 percent in March 2010 to 8.2 percent two years later. Responded to recession with a roughly $800 billion stimulus plan that nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated cut the unemployment rate by 0.7 to 1.8 percentage points. Continued implementation of Wall Street and auto industry bailouts begun under George W. Bush. Proposes tax breaks for U.S. manufacturers producing domestically or repatriating jobs from abroad, and tax penalties for U.S. companies outsourcing jobs. Won approval of South Korea, Panama and Colombia free-trade pacts begun under previous administration, completing the biggest round of trade liberalization since the North American Free Trade Agreement and other pacts of that era. Romney: Lower taxes, less regulation, balanced budget, more trade deals to spur growth. Replace jobless benefits with unemployment savings accounts. Proposes repeal of the (Dodd-Frank) law toughening financial-industry regulations after the meltdown in that sector. Proposes changing, but not repealing, the (Sarbanes-Oxley) law tightening accounting regulations in response to corporate scandals, to ease the accountability burden on smaller businesses. ""We don't want to tell the world that Republicans are against all regulation. No, regulation is necessary to make a free market work. But it has to be updated and modern."" EDUCATION: Obama: Has approved waivers freeing states from the most onerous requirements of the Bush-era No Child Left Behind law with their agreement to improve how they prepare and evaluate students. ""Race to the Top"" competition has rewarded winning states with billions of dollars for pursuing education policies Obama supports. Won approval for a college tax credit worth up to $10,000 over four years and more money for Pell grants for low-income college students. Wants Congress to agree to reduce federal aid to colleges that go too far in raising tuition. Romney: Supported the federal accountability standards of No Child Left Behind law. In 2007, said he was wrong earlier in career when he wanted the Education Department shut because he came to see the value of the federal government in ""holding down the interests of the teachers' unions"" and putting kids and parents first. Has said the student testing, charter-school incentives and teacher evaluation standards of Obama's ""Race to the Top"" competition ""make sense"" although the federal government should have less control of education. ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT: Obama: Ordered temporary moratorium on deep-water drilling after the massive BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico but has pushed for more oil and gas drilling overall. Approved drilling plan in Arctic Ocean opposed by environmentalists. Proposes Congress give oil market regulators more power to control price manipulation by speculators and stiffer fines for doing so. Achieved historic increases in fuel economy standards for automobiles that will save money at the pump while raising the cost of new vehicles. Achieved first-ever regulations on heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming and on toxic mercury pollution from power plants. Spent heavily on green energy and has embraced nuclear power as a clean source. Failed to persuade a Democratic Congress to pass limits he promised on carbon emissions. Shelved plan to toughen health standards on lung-damaging smog. Rejected Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada but supports fast-track approval of a segment of it. Proposes ending subsidies to oil industry but has failed to persuade Congress to do so. Romney: Supports opening the Atlantic and Pacific outer continental shelves to drilling, as well as Western lands, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and offshore Alaska; and supports exploitation of shale oil deposits. Wants to reduce obstacles to coal, natural gas and nuclear energy development, and accelerate drilling permits in areas where exploration has already been approved for developers with good safety records. Says green power has yet to become viable and the causes of climate change are unknown. Proposes to remove carbon dioxide from list of pollutants controlled by Clean Air Act and amend clean water and air laws to ensure the cost of complying with regulations is balanced against environmental benefit. Says cap and trade would ""rocket energy prices."" Blames high gas prices on Obama's decisions to limit oil drilling in environmentally sensitive areas and on overzealous regulation. GAY RIGHTS: Obama: Once opposed federal recognition of same-sex marriage, later said his views were ""evolving"" and has not taken a position on that since. Opposes constitutional amendment to ban it. Supports civil unions and letting states decide about marriage. Switched positions on Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal recognition of same-sex marriages and gives states the right to refuse to recognize such marriages. Once a supporter of the law, in 2008 he said he favored its repeal. The law remains, but his Justice Department no longer defends the statute's constitutionality. Achieved repeal of the military ban on openly gay service members. Romney: Favors constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, says policy should be set federally, not by states. ""Marriage is not an activity that goes on within the walls of a state."" But said he would not seek to restore a ban on openly gay service members. HEALTH CARE: Obama: Achieved landmark overhaul putting U.S. on path to universal coverage if the Supreme Court upholds the heath care law and its mandate for almost everyone to obtain insurance. Under the law, insurers will be banned from denying coverage to people with pre-existing illness, tax credits for middle-income and low-income people will subsidize premiums, people without work-based insurance will have access to new markets, small business gets help for offering insurance and Medicaid will be expanded, with the biggest changes starting in 2014. ""Nobody is going to go broke just because they get sick. And Americans will no longer be denied or dropped by their insurance companies just when they need care the most. That's what change is."" Romney: Promises to work for the repeal of the federal health care law modeled largely after his universal health care achievement in Massachusetts because he says states, not Washington, should drive policy on the uninsured. Proposes to guarantee that people who are ""continuously covered"" for a certain period be protected against losing insurance if they get sick, leave their job and need another policy. Would expand individual tax-advantaged medical savings accounts and let the savings be used for insurance premiums as well as personal medical costs. Would let insurance be sold across state lines to expand options, and restrict malpractice awards to restrain health care costs. Introduce ""generous"" but undetermined subsidies to help future retirees buy private insurance, or let them have the option of traditional Medicare, with a gradually increasing age to qualify for benefits. IMMIGRATION: Obama: Failed to deliver on a promised immigration overhaul, with the defeat of legislation that would have created a path to citizenship for young illegal immigrants enrolled in college or enlisted in the armed forces. Says he is still committed to it. Government has deported a record number of illegal immigrants under Obama, nearly 400,000 in each of the last three years. Romney: Favors U.S.-Mexico border fence, opposes education benefits to illegal immigrants. Opposes offering legal status to illegal immigrants who attend college, but would do so for those who serve in the armed forces. Establish an immigration-status verification system for employers and punish them if they hire non-citizens who do not prove their legal status. Proposes more visas for holders of advanced degrees in math, science and engineering who have U.S. job offers, and would award permanent residency to foreign students who graduate from U.S. schools with a degree in those fields. SOCIAL SECURITY: Obama: Has not proposed a comprehensive plan to address Social Security's long-term financial problems. During budget negotiations in 2011, proposed adopting a new measurement of inflation that would reduce annual increases in Social Security benefits. The proposal would reduce the long-term financing shortfall by about 25 percent, according to the Social Security actuaries. Romney: Protect the status quo for people 55 and over but, for the next generations of retirees, raise the retirement age for full benefits by one or two years and reduce inflation increases in benefits for wealthier recipients. TAXES: Obama: Wants to raise taxes on the wealthy and ensure they pay 30 percent of their income at minimum. Supports extending Bush-era tax cuts for everyone making under $200,000, or $250,000 for couples. But in 2010, agreed to a two-year extension of the lower rates for all. Wants to let the top tax rates go back up 3 to 4 points to 39.6 percent and 36 percent, and raise rates on capital gains and dividends for the wealthy. Health care law provides for tax on highest-value health insurance plans. Together with Congress, built a first-term record of significant tax cuts for families and business, some temporary. Romney: Drop all tax rates by 20 percent, bringing the top rate, for example, down to 28 percent from 35 percent and the lowest rate to 8 percent instead of 10 percent. Curtail deductions, credits and exemptions for the wealthiest. End Alternative Minimum Tax for individuals, eliminate capital gains tax for families making below $200,000 and cut corporate tax to 25 percent from 35 percent. Does not specify which tax breaks or programs he would curtail to help cover costs. Dodged on extending cut in payroll tax, saying he doesn't like ""temporary little Band-Aids"" but also he's not for raising taxes ""anywhere."" TERRORISM: Obama: Approved the raid that found and killed Osama bin Laden, set policy that U.S. would no longer use harsh interrogation techniques, a practice that had essentially ended later in George W. Bush's presidency. Largely carried forward Bush's key anti-terrorism policies, including detention of suspects at Guantanamo Bay despite promise to close the prison. Also has continued with military commissions instead of civilian courts for detainees and invocation of state secrets privilege in court. Expanded use of unmanned drone strikes against terrorist targets in Pakistan and Yemen. Romney: No constitutional rights for foreign terrorism suspects. In 2007, refused to rule out use of waterboarding to interrogate terrorist suspects. In 2011, his campaign said he does not consider waterboarding to be torture. WAR: Obama: Ended the Iraq war he had opposed and inherited, increased the U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan then began drawing down the force with a plan to have all out by the end of 2014. Approved use of U.S. air power in NATO-led campaign that helped Libyan opposition topple Moammar Gadhafi's government. Major reductions coming in the size of the Army and Marine Corps as part of agreement with congressional Republicans to cut $487 billion in military spending over a decade. Declined to repeat the Libya air power commitment for Syrian opposition. Opposes a near-term military strike on Iran, either by the U.S. or by Israel, to sabotage nuclear facilities that could be misused to produce a nuclear weapon. Says the U.S. will never tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran but negotiation and pressure through sanctions are the right way to prevent that outcome. Reserves the right to one day conclude that only a military strike can stop Iran from getting the bomb. Romney: Has not specified the troop numbers behind his pledge to ensure the ""force level necessary to secure our gains and complete our mission successfully"" in Afghanistan. ""This is not time for America to cut and run."" Said Obama was wrong to begin reducing troop levels as soon as he did. Would increase strength of armed forces, including number of troops and warships, adding almost $100 billion to the Pentagon budget in 2016. Has spoken in favor of covert action by the U.S. and regional allies in Syria but ""the right course is not military"" intervention by the U.S. Criticizes Obama's approach on Iran as too conciliatory and associates himself more closely with hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Has not explicitly threatened a U.S. military strike, but in one Republican debate said that re-electing Obama would guarantee an Iranian bomb and that electing him would guarantee Iran would not get a nuclear weapon. ""Of course you take military action"" if sanctions and internal opposition fail to dissuade Tehran from making a nuclear weapon.

SANTA FE (AP) -- Gov. Bill Richardson's State of the State, as prepared for delivery to the New Mexico Legislature on Tuesday:
\
Before we begin, let me say that the thoughts and prayers of every New Mexican are with the people of Haiti during this terrible disaster.
\
What we don't hold in riches, we have in generosity and I would like to encourage our citizens to do all they can to help those in such great need.
\
Lt. Gov. Diane Denish, Speaker Ben Lujan, Senate Pro-Tem Tim Jennings, distinguished members of the New Mexico Legislature and the State Supreme Court, members of our congressional delegation, honored guests, including New Mexico's First Lady Barbara Richardson and my fellow New Mexicans.
\
I'm sure you will agree that this year more than any other represents a defining moment for us all.
\
How we respond to tough times like these is a test of who we are as a people.
\
For 16 months now, New Mexico has felt the full impact of the worldwide economic storm.
\
Each of us knows someone who has been hurt by this recession -- a family member who has lost his job, a small business barely making payroll, seniors who have delayed retirement or a friend whose home is on the brink of foreclosure.
\
Perhaps more than any other time in history, New Mexicans need and are relying on state services from work force training and access to health care to the delivery of unemployment benefits.
\
And they recognize the crucial role our education system plays in charting the path for personal improvement and competitiveness in a changing economy.
\
So, while we continue to cut spending and look for ways to make government more efficient, we must not turn our backs on our most vulnerable citizens, nor should we be reckless with budget cuts and reverse the progress we've made during the past seven years.
\
I want New Mexicans to know that we have been and will continue to be good stewards of their money.
\
New Mexico has always been fiscally responsible.
\
Unlike Washington, New Mexico cannot run a deficit nor overspend.
\
We must have a balanced budget.
\
And we have balanced the budget every single year.
\
And in the past, when we had extra resources, some were tempted to spend our cash reserves but I refused.
\
I insisted we hold reserves at a minimum of 10 percent of overall spending at one point that was $650 million in our savings account.
\
That savings benefited us all when the national economy spiraled downward.
\
We have also grown our state's permanent funds, which are recovering after the financial meltdown.
\
Those funds are back up to $13.4 billion -- $4 billion higher than they were under my predecessor.
\
During the past year, we saw a 19 percent return on our investments.
\
And over the last seven years, we cut taxes by more than one billion dollars -- much of it went straight into the pockets of working New Mexico families.
\
However, despite balancing our budget every single year, building a sensible savings account, and investing wisely in our future, we face a serious revenue shortfall.
\
The national and global recessions have taken their toll on our economy and, just like 48 other states, New Mexico must respond.
\
After a period of strong economic growth -- with incomes jumping by 30 percent and a 39 percent growth of GDP between 2003 and 2008 -- the global recession has hurt our efforts to keep up that pace.
\
The good news is unemployment in New Mexico is still lower than the national level, and we continue to attract new jobs.
\
But many New Mexicans are out of work, and many more are doing more with less pay.
\
We must never forget them as we grapple with the tasks before us.
\
I am proposing a responsible and fair approach to balance our budget deficit.
\
We have already cut hundreds of millions of dollars in state spending.
\
While we can make more targeted cuts, it is important to note that most state agencies have been cut to the bone.
\
Any further cuts would mean certain layoffs, closing facilities and ending public services when our citizens need them most.
\
But I also believe that increasing taxes alone is irresponsible and not the answer to balancing the budget.
\
I will not give anyone a blank check to raise taxes and overburden hardworking New Mexico families.
\
Nor should we roll back important tax cuts and incentives that we've used to create jobs and open New Mexico for business.
\
Our efforts to build a high wage, high-tech economy must continue -- most urgently now in this time of job loss and economic turmoil.
\
To be fair and responsible we need to take the middle path, a balanced approach that combines targeted spending cuts and short-term revenues with strong accountability measures.
\
Like our citizens, this administration has tightened its belt since this recession began.
\
I implemented a hiring and salary freeze more than a year ago, and we currently have 3,000 vacancies in state government.
\
I eliminated positions and cut salaries of exempt state employees -- those appointed by me -- by 2 percent. Now 110 exempt positions are vacant.
\
I ordered five furlough days for about 17,000 employees.
\
I froze $150 million in stalled capital outlay projects -- both mine and yours -- and I urge this body to eliminate those projects.
\
And we have cut state agency budgets by 7 percent on average.
\
None of these measures were popular, but all were necessary.
\
My budget plan for the next fiscal year reduces spending by $510 million through the following measures:
\
First, make permanent the $218 million in cuts we made during the special session and by executive order.
\
Second, reduce costs by another $158 million by cutting spending across state government.
\
Third, eliminate stalled capital outlay projects and end the practice of double dipping.
\
Last, streamline and merge government functions, based on recommendations from my Committee on Government Efficiency. By consolidating agencies, as well as boards and commissions with overlapping functions, we can save at least $25 million.
\
I want to thank former Gov. Garrey Carruthers for leading this government efficiency effort.
\
I also want to thank former Gov. Toney Anaya for taking on the critical job of overseeing the federal stimulus money flowing into New Mexico.
\
As we look to raise revenue to help us through this crisis, I will only support a temporary revenue increase that -- automatically expires in three years or less.
\
I will also oppose any tax increase that hurts our efforts to keep the state economically competitive and create new jobs such as:
\
--Increasing personal income taxes
\
--Rolling back our capital gains tax cuts or
\
--Decreasing business tax incentives or credits that are working to create jobs
\
Nor will I support reinstating the food tax.
\
We cannot ask working New Mexicans to pay more for groceries when too many are struggling to make ends meet.
\
Even in a time of shortfall, I insist that education must remain our top investment.
\
Let me also be very clear, budget cuts are not an excuse for cutting quality, for rolling back accountability, for lowering our standards or for giving up our responsibility to educate our children.
\
We have invested more than $1 billion in classroom spending -- much of that for professional teacher salaries tied to increased accountability.
\
We rank third in the nation for percentage increase in average teacher salaries in the last decade and we've moved from 46th to 37th in salary ranking.
\
And over that time, we have moved from 67 percent of core courses being taught by highly qualified teachers to 98 percent.
\
Our investment in pre-K and full-day kindergarten is paying off.
\
New Mexico pre-K graduates scored higher on early math and literacy skills than children who did not participate.
\
And last year when the first class of full-day kindergartners entered the third grade and took their first round of standardized tests, they far outperformed third graders from previous years.
\
But I want us to go much further.
\
I want New Mexico be the first state in the nation to have a Hispanic Education Act.
\
We will be held accountable for results by creating an annual report card on the status of Hispanic Education.
\
We will increase parental and community involvement and close the achievement gap.
\
We are also bringing back 10,000 dropouts to complete their education as part of our Graduate New Mexico initiative.
\
Through aggressive interventions into low-performing schools, we are going to make sure more of our young men and women enter the work force with the skills to get better-paying jobs.
\
I will also continue my strong support for innovative charter schools.
\
I believe the increased choices and competition charter schools provide is healthy for our state.
\
That is why I will fight any move to place moratoriums on new schools.
\
Finally, while we have seen a positive return on our investment, we must always be accountable for taxpayer money and safeguard our limited educational resources.
\
To that end, I propose that all local school boards receive financial training to ensure they can hold schools accountable for the money they spend.
\
I also want school boards to establish strict policies and procedures to prevent the abuse of credit and purchase cards.
\
We must do all we can to stop fraud and abuse in our schools.
\
I would like to recognize the work of the Legislative Finance Committee and State Auditor Hector Balderas in uncovering, investigating, and prosecuting these abuses.
\
My bottom line is this: I don't want to cut teacher salaries and I don't want to cut classroom spending.
\
If we have to cut education spending, we should start with the bureaucracy and district administrations.
\
Together, we've passed significant ethics reforms -- setting strict campaign contribution limits, providing public financing for judicial posts, and capping gifts to candidates, employees and officials.
\
But several vital reforms have been put off for too long:
\
--Whistleblower protections to shield employees from retaliation for reporting fraud, waste or abuse.
\
--Disclosure by any contractor wishing to make a bid on a state project of any campaign contribution of $250 or more over the last two years.
\
--A ban on candidates doing taxpayer-funded, public service announcements.
\
--An end to the revolving door where legislators this year become lobbyists next year. Just like we did for state officials.
\
--A ban on campaign contributions by corporations, state contractors or lobbyists.
\
If we as elected officials want the public trust, then we must trust our people.
\
I believe we need an independent, bipartisan, citizen-led ethics commission. This commission must be able to investigate, discipline, fine or censure, not just public officials or state employees, but also contractors and lobbyists.
\
Forty-one other states have such a commission.
\
New Mexico needs one too.
\
Our road to long-term solvency cannot depend on the whims of the oil and gas market.
\
It must be built on the revenues generated by creating thousands of high-paying jobs in emerging sectors of our economy -- such as alternative and renewable energy, aerospace, high tech, advanced research and development, media and others.
\
Nothing is more important for our families, nothing is more important for our state.
\
At the beginning of my administration, I asked this Legislature to ""give me the tools,"" and we will get the jobs.
\
Today, I'm pleased to report that those tools -- like targeted tax incentives to attract innovative companies offering high wage jobs -- are paying off.
\
We have successfully recruited Fortune 500 companies like Hewlett Packard, Schott Solar, Fidelity Investments, who are creating 6,000 high-paying jobs in New Mexico.
\
But those incentives are working equally well to recruit medium-sized companies to rural New Mexico.
\
For instance, we have announced:
\
--Two hundred jobs at PreCheck in Alamogordo
\
--Six hundred jobs at Signet Solar in Belen
\
--Forty jobs at Sunland Peanuts in Portales
\
--Twenty jobs at eSolar in Sunland Park
\
--Three hundred and eighteen jobs at the New Business Conference Center in Silver City
\
--Fifty jobs at the Northern New Mexico Wood Business Park in Las Vegas
\
And just last week 150 new jobs at Johnson Plate and Tower Manufacturer in Santa Teresa
\
And in the next few weeks I will be announcing new companies offering hundreds of jobs in Gallup and Roswell.
\
I'm pleased to report that Spaceport America is ahead of schedule and under budget.
\
As we speak 467 new workers are on the job constructing the first commercial spaceport in the world, with 150 to 300 more hires expected over this year.
\
The Spaceport is fulfilling its promise of inspiring young men and women to study math and science, developing our southern and statewide economy and expanding tourism.
\
For those who doubt if the Spaceport will bring in business, you should know that Virgin Galactic has over $42 million deposited for more than three hundred reservations.
\
The demand is there.
\
New Mexico will get its return on investment.
\
To make sure New Mexico remains competitive against Virginia, Florida and Texas, I'm asking this body to pass legislation allowing participants to assume the risks of spaceflight.
\
A singular bright sector in our economy throughout the state remains the film industry.
\
Today, more than 10,000 direct and indirect jobs and thousands of New Mexico businesses are tied to the film industry, including over 250 new businesses started here.
\
More than 130 major movie and television productions have been made in New Mexico during this administration, bringing over $3 billion in economic impact and generating hundreds of millions in state and local tax revenues.
\
These film and TV productions bring new dollars and showcase not just the attractions of Albuquerque or Santa Fe, but also the charm of New Mexico's great small towns and pueblos -- like Stanley and Roy, Santa Ana and San Ildefonso, Willard and Madrid, Carrizozo and Chimayo, Pecos and Tijeras, as well as Cochiti and To'hajiliee.
\
And while New Mexico does not provide the most generous film incentives in the nation, we do provide the most effective ones.
\
We have built a global reputation as both a leader and a preferred production location due to our talented work force, experienced management and unmatched natural beauty.
\
Indeed, with two more Golden Globe awards going the New Mexico film ""Crazy Heart"" this past Sunday night.
\
New Mexicans continue to prove that we make some of the finest films in the world.
\
Due to our past efforts, and given the direction the industry is moving in, we have a unique opportunity over the next 12 to 18 months to make this industry an integral part of our state's economy along with ranching, oil and gas, and other core sectors.
\
And with more than 12,000 New Mexico students around the state currently preparing for a career in film and media production, our commitment to this industry is our commitment to their future.
\
Next, we will continue to keep our responsibility to protect our communities.
\
We have thrown the book at drunk drivers: mandating ignition interlocks for every offender, running statewide super-blitzes, cracking down on bars that overserve and opening a 24-hour hot line.
\
I'm proud to report that since 2003 our alcohol involved fatalities have decreased by almost 30 percent and remain the lowest in state history. New Mexico is no longer in the top 10 states for alcohol-involved fatalities.
\
This session, I'm proposing new legislation to continue our fight against DWI and gang violence.
\
Specifically, I will once again push for tougher penalties for gang crimes and criminal gang recruitment and I will close loopholes in our DWI laws that allow offenders to skip out of mandatory jail time.
\
Last session we passed smart legislation to help victims of domestic violence take time off to get a protection order and granted law enforcement new tools to fight stalking.
\
I'm proposing that the task force that authored that legislation and dozens of other domestic violence initiatives become permanent in statute.
\
I would like to also recognize and thank first lady Barbara Richardson for her tireless work to end domestic violence in our state.
\
Next, I am calling for a statewide ban on the use of hand-held cell phones for talking or texting while driving.
\
Distracted drivers focused on their cell-phone or text conversations, rather than on the road, have become a menace to our streets.
\
Perhaps the greatest area of partnership between this Legislature and my administration has been in making New Mexico the Clean Energy State.
\
Others, like California, have tried to claim that title.
\
But I believe we've earned it -- passing an aggressive renewable portfolio standard, creating the Renewable Energy Transmission Authority and creating the most comprehensive package of clean energy tax incentives in the nation.
\
Just last session we went further, with new initiatives to train our green jobs work force, to establish new districts for renewable energy financing, and to expand solar market development tax credits.
\
This year we must build on that progress by doubling the incentive for solar electricity producers who locate in our state.
\
In last year's State of the State, I announced the creation of the Green Jobs Cabinet to create a statewide strategic plan for clean energy, clean technology economic development and job creation.
\
Through the work of that cabinet, we have developed ambitious goals:
\
--Be the leader in renewable energy export.
\
--Be the center of the North American solar industry.
\
--Lead the nation in green grid innovation.
\
--Be a center of excellence for green building and energy efficiency.
\
--Have a highly skilled and ready to work clean tech work force.
\
On each of these, we have made tremendous progress.
\
In terms of exporting: New Mexico will soon be home to the Tres Amigas superstation -- connecting America's three main power grids -- and enabling our state to export renewable energy to customers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
\
In terms of solar manufacturing: We are now the new home to Emcore, Signet Solar and are the international headquarters for Schott Solar.
\
And we will soon be announcing one of the world's largest solar generation plants in eastern New Mexico.
\
For green grid: Our green grid collaboration among our national labs, utilities and research universities is being built.
\
As a testament to its potential for innovation, we are proud to count a new partner -- the government of Japan.
\
But we must do more.
\
Coal-fired energy plants remain a major source of energy at home and at work, but pump far too much pollution into our skies.
\
We must demand responsible actions by industry, and we must also give them the tools to do it.
\
That's why I'm proposing three bills: one to punish those who repeatedly and grossly pollute our air, another to enable coal companies to initiate carbon storage and a global warming cap and trade bill to create market mechanisms, for reducing pollution and rewarding efficiency.
\
We kept the Valle Vidal wild and protected the largest publicly owned area of Chihuahuan Desert grassland, the Otero Mesa.
\
We also opened four new state parks to the public -- Eagle Nest Lake, Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Mesilla Valley Bosque, Cerrillos Hills and authorized the creation of Pecos Canyon State Park.
\
To continue our legacy of conservation, I am proposing the passage of the Natural Heritage Conservation Act to fund efforts to protect forests and watersheds, working farms and ranches, as well as habitat restoration and management.
\
I also ask this legislature to address three more important issues:
\
--Our tax code is hitting too many homeowners with unfair increases -- sometimes two or three times as much as their neighbors -- I will send this legislature a proposal to move us toward a fair and equitable property tax system.
\
--Our tribal communities have over $1 billion in critical infrastructure needs. I believe it's time to dedicate modest recurring funding 5 percent of annual severance tax bond capacity -- to our successful Tribal Infrastructure Fund.
\
It's time to fully extend domestic partnership rights. A committed couple, who agrees to spend their lives together, deserves equal protection under the law. And as I've said before and I will say again -- as a state whose diversity is its strength, we cannot accept discrimination in any form.
\
While we have accomplished much together, there have been times where we have stood far apart -- when we stood behind bully pulpits pointing fingers, instead of sitting side-by-side at the table solving problems.
\
I may have even been wrong, once or twice. Don't push it.
\
Heading into this session, I urge everyone in this chamber to consider the following words from the late Gov. Bruce King.
\
When asked what his legacy would be, he said, ""I guess just getting New Mexico to realize that if we were going to be successful, we were going to all work together and be one large family.""
\
I believe in this time of need, if we are to succeed, we must work together, maybe even as a family.
\
Our state cannot afford inaction and stalemate.
\
We must act, and act responsibly.
\
As I reflected on how I wanted to conclude this State of the State -- don't clap yet -- I thought back to how it all began during the campaign eight years ago.
\
I remember as we went town to town, and door to door, trying to explain what we wanted to accomplish.
\
Cynics and critics told us what we couldn't do:
\
We can't use money from the permanent fund to invest in school classrooms.
\
We can't hold school districts accountable by forcing them to shift dollars from administration to the classroom.
\
We can't invest $1 billion in modern public school buildings.
\
But we did.
\
We can't hold polluters accountable for their effect on the environment, or create new parks, or set aggressive renewable energy standards.
\
But we did.
\
We can't build a film industry -- or a spaceport -- or a modern commuter rail.
\
But we did.
\
We can't lower taxes for working families, or improve access to health care for kids, or raise the minimum wage.
\
But we did.
\
We can't start a pre-kindergarten program, or expand full-day kindergarten, and we can't get junk food out of school.
\
But we did.
\
We can't invest $1 billion into modern and safe highways, curb domestic violence and there is absolutely no way you can reduce drunk driving.
\
But we did.
\
If there is one thing I know about the people of New Mexico, it's that if we can get past our beliefs that something is too difficult, or too far out of reach, then we can accomplish great things.
\
Ladies and gentlemen, New Mexico will recover.
\
It's going to take hard work and shared sacrifice.
\
We will need to remember to believe in ourselves, and never forget to believe in each other.
\
As I said in the beginning of this address, how we respond to these tough times is a test of us as a people.
\
Let our response in these extraordinary times be as extraordinary as our people.

126,"Climate change is a real, perilous phenomenon that the planet would be foolish to ignore. Given that, the vexing question has always been, how do we sensibly protect our environment without manacling our energy-driven economy?\Trouble is, this country has gravitated toward fuel economy standards for vehicles when a simpler, easier to administer option awaits. More on that in a moment.\President Donald Trump is gearing up a rollback of those fuel economy standards. By exactly how much isn't known yet, but this is a direct hit on former President Barack Obama's preferred method of cutting tailpipe emissions as one way to curtail global warming.\Obama's plan forced carmakers to, by 2025, ramp up the average fuel efficiency of new light trucks and cars to more than 50 miles per gallon in lab settings, or roughly 36 mpg in real-world driving. It brought the rest of the country in line with the tough fuel economy standards California enforces.\The Trump administration says the rollback will free carmakers from regulations that have kept them from producing more affordable vehicles.\California won't surrender easily to Washington. It has the power to enforce stricter air pollution standards, thanks to a special waiver granted under the 1970 Clean Air Act.\It remains to be seen how Trump will handle the California conundrum. He could revoke California's waiver, which likely would yield a protracted court fight. If he takes no action, the waiver will expire in 2025. In the meantime, carmakers would have to choose between producing two distinct lines of cars to meet the different fuel standards — the federal government's and California's — or adhering to California's stricter standards.\Because they're aimed more at manufacturers than at motorists, fuel efficiency standards are an inefficient means to reach a good end: less gasoline consumption.\Trump instead would be smart to embrace a different, smarter idea this page has advocated for some time: A carbon tax imposed on fuel production would give consumers a choice: Want to save money and the environment? Fine, then consume less fuel than you do today. Prefer your gas-guzzling SUV? OK, but you'll pay more for every gallon. And if your state wants even more stringent efforts to depress fuel consumption state lawmakers could add a state-based carbon levy to the federal tax.\Think about it this way: Fuel standards complicate life for automakers trying to appease government regulators as well as their own customers. A carbon tax puts the onus on drivers to conserve — or pay.\— Chicago Tribune, April 3"
127,"
Almost a year ago, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott won a landslide election with a nearly single-issue campaign: repeal the carbon tax. On July 17, he made good on that promise, as the Australian Senate voted, 39 to 32, to abolish the ""world's biggest carbon tax"" -- a tax that was reported to ""do nothing to address global warming, apart from imposing high costs on the local economy.""

Australia was one of the first major countries, outside of the European Union, to adopt a carbon price -- first suggested in 2007 and passed under Labour Prime Minister Julia Gillard in 2011.
\
The Journal reports that when Australia's carbon tax was passed, the Brookings Institute ""described Australia as an 'Important laboratory and learning opportunity.'""
\
So, what do we learn from the ""laboratory"" the now-failed ""model legislation"" offered?
\
First, the Journal states: ""The public hates it."" The (U.K.) Telegraph calls the tax: ""one of the most unsuccessful in history"" and points out that it is ""unique in that it generated virtually no revenue for the Australian treasury due to its negative impact on productivity; contributed to the rising costs that have taken the gloss off the country's resources boom; and essentially helped to bring down Ms Gillard's former Government.""
\
The Telegraph, in an article titled: ""Australia abandons disastrous green tax on emissions,"" adds that the tax failed in ""winning over voters who faced higher costs passed on by the companies that had to pay for it.""
\
The Telegraph offers this summary: ""carbon trading mechanisms and green taxes have largely been a failure elsewhere and especially so in Europe where they have dragged on investment and threatened long-term energy security.""
\
These are important lessons in light of the renewed push for a carbon tax in the United States as evidenced by the partnership of President George W. Bush's Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and liberal billionaire Tom Steyer, who are, together, calling for a climate tax.
\
According to the Journal, the World Bank called Australia's repeal, ""one of the biggest international threats to the rollout of similar programs elsewhere."" The climate lobby is concerned as ""Australia's vote shows that the real obstacle to their dreams of controlling more of the world's economy is democratic consent.""
\
In the United States, similar efforts to reduce CO2 emissions by increasing costs to emitters, and therefore consumers -- in our case, cap and trade -- failed to achieve ""democratic consent"" even when Democrats had control. The people didn't want it. So, the Obama administration now is trying to go around Congress with onerous rules and regulations on emissions.
\
Jennifer Marohasy, Ph.D., who worked for 12 years as a scientist for the Queensland government, told me: ""In short, repeal of the carbon tax is a big symbolic win. But it's mostly just window-dressing: to appease the masses. In the background, proponents of anthropogenic global warming who dominate our political class still very much control the levers of government and intend to continue to terrorize the population with claims of catastrophic global warming, while consolidating their rent-seeking through the (Renewable Energy Target).""
\
May America learn from the ""important laboratory"" of Australia's foray into climate schemes.

128,"As if any more evidence were needed that climate change is making extreme heat more likely, take a look at what happened in Southern California last week. On Tuesday at Dodger Stadium, the first-pitch temperature for the opening game of the World Series was a record-shattering 103 degrees. The same day, two other locations hit 108, matching the hottest weather the nation has seen so late in the year.\And how is the Trump administration responding to these flashing-red warning signs of global warming on the West Coast and elsewhere around the world? By systematically dismantling the Obama administration's environmental initiatives.\Just five months ago, President Trump broke with nearly 200 other countries in taking the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, a stunning move given that the accord regulated nothing, relying only on peer pressure and transparency to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Nicaragua recently joined the Paris pact, leaving the United States and war-ravaged Syria as the odd nations out.\Now the Trump administration is turning its attention to gutting the Clean Power Plan, the 2015 Obama initiative aimed at curbing greenhouse gases from energy plants. This latest effort to kill the Clean Power Plan demonstrates sheer contempt for laws governing clean air and the benefits of environmental regulation. Power plants generate about a third of the 6 billion tons of carbon dioxide America pumps into the atmosphere each year. The Clean Power Plan offered a reasonable pathway to reducing these emissions by a third by 2030, giving each state flexibility to reach that goal. The plan was the next best idea to a market-based carbon tax that would be rebated to consumers.\Yes, it would undoubtedly result in less burning of coal, the dirtiest fuel. But coal was already in decline — with or without new environmental regulations — as utilities embraced cleaner-burning natural gas and alternatives such as wind and solar.\U.S. coal mining jobs have fallen to fewer than 77,000, while those in renewable energy have hit 800,000 and keep increasing. Some of the nation's largest power companies this month shrugged off Trump's regulatory rollback, arguing that clean energy has proved to be good business and vowing to keep reducing emissions.\EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's proposal for dismantling the Clean Power Plan mentions drafting a new method for reducing carbon dioxide.

If there's any good news, it's that the Clean Power Plan — or some similar action to significantly reduce greenhouse gases gushing from the nation's electricity sector — is likely to survive this effort at sabotage.

The following editorial appeared in the Washington Post:
\
Barely three months after a fertilizer-plant explosion in West, Texas, claimed 14 lives, a runaway train bearing crude oil derailed early Saturday morning, igniting a fireball that killed at least five people in a small Quebec town near the Maine border. Some 40 people from Lac-Megantic are still missing, and much of the town -- about 30 buildings -- was incinerated.
\
The train, operated by the U.S.-owned Montreal Maine & Atlantic Railway Inc., had stopped for a routine crew change and inspection by an engineer, but then it started moving on its own, traveling nearly seven miles before it careened off the tracks. The crash remains under investigation, but one truth is already clear: There are real and oft-ignored dangers involved in the transfer of crude oil by rail.
\
In the midst of a boom in North American oil production, the amount of crude shipped by rail has skyrocketed. In 2008 9,500 carloads were shipped by rail, the Wall Street Journal reported; by 2012, that had soared to 234,000 carloads. On balance, the exploitation of new oil fields, like the growth in natural-gas production, has been a boon to the U.S. economy and foreign policy. But infrastructure has not kept pace. Particularly as political opposition has slowed pipeline construction, oil transport has had to rely on a network of railways, some of which are outdated and in need of repair. Investigators from Greenpeace found that some oil tank cars used in Canada and the United States were unsafe even 20 years ago. Along the same lines, in a 2009 report, the National Transportation Safety Board, investigating a derailment in Illinois, concluded that the outdated design of the cars was essentially a fuse waiting to be lit. A full report has yet to be released on the Lac-Megantic disaster, but, as The New York Times has pointed out, it looks as though the cars in question were of that same model.
\
Environmentalists are pressing President Obama to deny TransCanada Corp.'s application to build the Keystone XL pipeline that would move bitumen (a heavy, oil-like substance) from Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico. Their chief objection is to the source of the oil, which they say cannot be extracted without more damage to the environment than occurs in typical oil drilling. But in their zeal to stop the project, they also have focused heavily on the supposed danger of oil pipelines.
\
The tragedy in Quebec is a reminder that no transportation method is without risk. Pipelines, properly built and maintained, offer the most secure, as well as most efficient, method. A gradual reduction of greenhouse gases is the right goal; as we've argued, the way to achieve it is through a carbon tax or, failing congressional action, the kind of regulations Mr. Obama recently proposed that would have the effect of weaning power plants off coal. The activists' focus on Keystone represents a misordering of priorities.
\
Whatever happens with the pipeline, though, a lot of oil will continue to move by train. The accident in Lac-Megantic should focus attention on the safety of the continent's rails.

135,"The only time Cameron Duncan thinks about the 10 solar photovoltaic panels partially powering his Santa Fe house is when he walks past the electric meter on sunny days.\The meter is spinning merrily backward.\Every spin and every kilowatt hour of electricity the solar panels produce are a little money in Duncan's pocket from Public Service Company of New Mexico, which pays him for the power. ""We're hoping this investment will pay off as the cost of polluting, fossil-fuel power rises,"" he said of his year-old system.\But when the sun doesn't shine and on short winter days, the Duncan house, like thousands of Santa Fe homes and businesses, draws electricity from PNM. And most of that power comes from two aging coal-fired plants in the Four Corners region.\Coal is the most polluting, greenhouse-gas-emitting way to generate power. But for now, it remains the cheapest and most reliable power source for New Mexico customers, according to PNM officials.\""We have to balance cost, reliability and the environment,"" said Evelin Wheeler, PNM's strategic planning director. ""The bottom line is people want to turn on the lights when they want to.""\Balancing act\When Duncan flips on a light switch, turns on his computer or starts his washing machine, he taps into a powerful stream of electrons often traveling hundreds of miles through a network of transmission lines. Since his solar system is tied into this grid, its impossible to separate his sun-produced electrons from those coming out of a smoke-belching, coal-fired plant.\Every day, 65,376 Santa Fe area customers rely on PNM for their electricity, almost twice as many as in 1988. Duncan and 91 other customers generate some of their own electricity from the sun, but depend on PNM for the rest. Others pay PNM extra for wind-generated power.\Every year, power's price tag creeps up, although only recently has PNM received permission from the state to pass more of those costs on to customers. Some people have seen their bills go up prior to the rate increases, in part because average use has risen, according to PNM. In 1990, the average customer used 508 kilowatt hours per month; this year the average use is 600 kwh.\Currently, 62 percent of most Santa Feans' electricity comes from two coal-fired power plants near Farmington -- San Juan Generating Station and the Four Corners Power Plant.\Greg Nelson, executive director of PNM's utility services, said coal provides the same advantage to both company and customer: It is a proven, reliable power source. ""It provides the base load power (the electricity needed year round). Unlike wind and solar energy, it is available 24/7, 365 days a year,"" Nelson said. ""The only things that can do that are coal, nuclear, oil and gas and small amounts of geothermal and biomass.""\Coal is available anytime, but the sun doesn't always shine, and the wind doesn't always blow. So the power isn't always available during hours of peak demand when customers decide at once to turn on air conditioners, coffee makers and computers. The only way to take full advantage of that renewable power is store it. No one has figured out how to do that on a large scale.\The billowing smokestacks of the Four Corners Power Plant and San Juan Generating Station, both built more than three decades ago, have raised the ire of environmentalists. PNM and its partners have tried to clean up San Juan with upgrades. They are now in the midst of $320 million in environmental improvements driven in part by a court decree. The upgrades will further reduce particulates, sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxides, and cut mercury emissions in half, Nelson said.\Currently, there aren't emissions standards for the greenhouse-gas carbon dioxide emitted by coal-fired plants.\Another 19 percent of Santa Feans' power comes from the Palo Verde nuclear power plant near Phoenix. The rest is from natural gas, solar, wind and energy efficiency. When all that can't meet customer needs, PNM purchases the balance on the wholesale market.\PNM, an investor-owned power company, must meet a state mandate to supply 20 percent of its power from renewable sources by 2020. Of that, wind and solar each have to represent 20 percent of the power, and the rest can come from other renewable sources such as geothermal.\Taking action\According to a newly released long-range resource plan, PNM doesn't plan on building any new coal-fired plants. But coal-fired power will remain the backbone of the company's energy sources for years to come, Wheeler said. PNM also plans on keeping its share of the Palo Verde nuclear plant, but not increasing the amount of nuclear power it draws in the near future.\The company has laid out its reasoning in the resource plan that it will present to the Public Regulation Commission in September. PNM's number crunchers tried various scenarios for boosting renewable supplies and reducing coal-fired power without increasing the cost of electricity. They included the potential fees Congress might one day levy on carbon dioxide emissions. ""The result was it was still very costly to replace that (coal) energy,"" said PNM's Wheeler. ""The reliability decreased if it came from solar or wind, and the costs increased."" \Tom Singer, a policy analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council, participated in many of the public meetings for PNM's resource plan. In the long run, the resource plan hedges PNM's bets, Singer said. ""In a nutshell, nobody knows what the numbers will be. No one knows how much a carbon tax or what new renewable technologies will cost. These uncertainties are much larger than in the past.""\Singer said the company's plans for the short term show a good commitment to renewables and energy efficiency.\PNM has issued two requests for proposals on renewable energy projects: one for a 100 megawatt solar power plant and the other for any size or type renewable energy project. Both requests have generated interest from dozens of companies. PNM plans to award the contracts by early next year.\Wheeler said some people think PNM overestimated the cost of renewable energy in the resource plan. She said bids on the two requests for proposals will give PNM a better idea of the real cost. ""The beauty of this planning process is if (renewable energy) turns out to be less expensive, then we can change (our mix of sources),"" she said.\Increasing the large-scale use of renewable energy relies on improving the technology and building more projects, both helped by tax incentives. Congress thus far has failed to renew a 30 percent federal tax credit that ends Dec. 31 for large-scale wind and solar projects. \Even residents rely on tax credits to sweeten the deal on solar PV systems. As much as he supports clean energy, Duncan said, he might not have put out the money for his system without state and federal tax incentives.\Energy efficiency\PNM is hoping new energy efficiency programs will help reduce the energy demands on the system.\One is Peak Saver, a program that lets PNM remotely shut off power to large-energy users temporarily during peak demand. The city of Santa Fe participates and lets PNM periodically turn off power to the ice rink at the Genoveva Chavez Community Center for a few hours, according to Nick Schiavo, the city's energy manager. The city is expecting a check from PNM for about $10,000 for the energy savings.\Reducing energy needs helps PNM meet peak power loads with the energy sources it already has without having to buy more or build new power plants.\Energy efficiency programs also help customers reduce their electric bills, said PNM spokeswoman Susan Sponar. Those programs depend on customers joining, said Singer, whose group is a member of New Mexico's Coalition for Clean, Affordable Energy. ""This is not about lights going out. It's about managing our use,"" Singer said. ""Gee whiz, we are just total energy hogs in this country.""\Local production\One efficiency PNM can't do much about is the loss of energy from any fossil-fueled power source before it reaches customers. Coal-fired plants lose almost two-thirds of their electricity before it hits transmission lines. Another 3 percent or 4 percent leaks from transmission lines. Those energy losses haven't changed in 50 years.\One way to reduce the energy losses is by generating power closer to customers.\Duncan's photovoltaic panels have their own inefficiencies. But since the panels are next to his house, he doesn't lose any electricity through the power line. \Every month this summer, he's received a check averaging $20. In the winter, he's paying about $20 a month for energy, so he figures he's almost zeroed out his PNM bill. That includes his monthly service fee and a variety of other fees PNM tacks on to his bill. \PNM pays Duncan 13 cents a kilowatt-hour for electricity generated by the PV panels and another 7 cents for each kilowatt-hour produced in excess of his home's power use. \His PV system is part of PNM's distributed generation program that allows any solar PV system up to 10 kwh capacity to tie into the company's power lines. PNM is now asking the PRC for permission to offer a similar program for systems larger than 10 kwh, a potential boon to big energy users.\The city of Santa Fe is looking at some local production projects, said Schiavo. It recently received a $125,000 grant from the state to install a highly efficient combined heat-and-power natural-gas system at the Genoveva Chavez Community Center. \The city also put out a request for bids to install a large solar PV system at the wastewater treatment plant. Those bids were due Friday. Schiavo said the city hopes whoever wins the bid will then submit the project to PNM. If the project is built, the city would contract for the power at a set price for the next 20 years, a buffer against the rising cost of electricity.\Local control\Some energy advocates, like mechanical engineer Mark Sardella, think the best buffer against rising costs would be for the city to establish its own power utility. \Back in 2004, Sardella, co-founder of the nonprofit, Local Energy, lead a joint city-county energy task force. He and others thought the best thing for Santa Fe to do was install renewable energy plants in the city and take control over its energy future. Local control would give the city more options over its energy sources and retain more of the revenue from the utility in Santa Fe. They even talked about alternatives for providing energy to a proposed river-diversion project. \Sardella claims PNM convinced the task force nothing else would work except for the company to provide energy the usual way. Sardella thinks that will hurt Santa Fe in the long run. ""You need food, water and energy production to be locally produced for real security,"" he said.\Others say the cost of starting an independent municipal utility would be prohibitive. The city alone uses roughly 38 million kilowatt-hours per year for buildings, street lights, water delivery, wastewater treatment and other power needs. \Los Alamos County gained control over its power production in 1985. The county and Los Alamos National Laboratory joined together to take over the White Rock distribution system from PNM. The county raised bond revenue to install two hydroelectric plants and bought a share in the coal-fired San Juan Generating Station. John Arrowsmith, the utility's manager, said the rest of the power is purchased from other plants. He said the county serves 9,000 electric customers who pay 8.6 cents per kwh, a little higher than PNM customers. But they pay one service charge and no surcharges, unlike PNM customers, he said. PNM still controls the transmission lines that deliver power to Los Alamos. Arrowsmith said that makes economic sense. \Arrowsmith said the benefits of the county's owning the utility include better coordination with other county departments on projects, a local governing board and revenues directed to improving infrastructure. ""If citizens want to go into more renewable resources, we can do that. Just the whole local control thing is an advantage,"" he said. \To see the PNM long-range resource plan, visit the Web site at www.pnm.com/regulatory/pdf-electricity/electric-irp-draft-rpt.pdf.\Contact Staci Matlock at 470-9843 \or smatlock@sfnewmexican.com."
136," LANL NEEDS TO SHOW ACCURATE BUDGET NUMBERS\ In ""State lawmaker encourages lab to diversify"" (July 28), Los Alamos National Laboratory Associate Director Terry Wallace claims that nuclear-weapons programs receive 57 percent of the lab's budget; nonproliferation, 20 percent; basic science, 10 percent; energy, 7 percent; and security,\ 6 percent.\ According to federal budget documents, the U.S. Department of Energy wants to fund LANL $1.84 billion in 2007. Additional funding from ""Work for Others"" (Department of Defense, Homeland Security, etc.) makes a total lab budget of around $2.1 billion. Out of DOE funding, $1.38 billion will be for nuclear weapons research and production programs, 66 percent of total lab funding; nonproliferation $173.8 million, or 8 percent; ""science"" $54.37 million, or 2.6 percent; energy $46.86 million, or 2.2 percent.\ For the good of the country and New Mexico, these budget ratios should be reversed. Given growing debate over future lab missions, the least LANL officials should do is give accurate budget figures for current missions.\ Jay Coghlan\ Nuclear Watch New Mexico\ Santa Fe\ United we fly\ Letter writer Bob Parmelee (Aug. 2, ""Nuclear power most efficient energy"") begins his plea for nuclear power by using the expression ""left-wing environmentalists. ..."" I didn't know there were left- wing, or right-wing environmentalists. I thought there were only those people looking out for the welfare of the environment, and at the same time, for people. Surely Mr. Parmelee knows that without a left wing, a bird can't fly. The same would be true for the right wing. They need both.\ Mr. Parmelee goes on to quote Sen. Pete Domenici, who, over the course of 40 years has been a shill for any industry that contributes to his campaigns. One hopes he retires soon.\ Mr. Parmelee ends his letter by referring to China as ""progressive."" That's a good one. He might have named France as an example, and while doing so, he could have educated us as to the disposal of that nuclear waste.\ Stan Bermann\ Santa Fe\ Conservation option\ I recently received an e-mail from U.S. Rep. Tom Udall touting his introduction of legislation providing incentives for renewable- energy measures.\ That is fine as far as it goes: We cannot combat global warming without a drastic shift toward renewable energy sources. However, we must not accept blindly the notion that our energy consumption is going to continue to rise at the current nonsustainable rate.\ In addition to shifting to renewable-energy sources, we must concomitantly reduce our level of consumption. Some of this can be achieved with low levels of pain: Increases in fleet average- vehicle fuel economy, drastic excise taxes on gas-guzzling SUVs, continuation of tax benefits for hybrids and incentives for plug-in hybrids when they become available. Others will be more painful: mandatory phase-out of old appliances and home heating systems, and strict efficiency standards for new ones; a carbon tax or the equivalent, that will force the marketplace to make carbon-smart energy choices.\ My principal concern is that the Udall-sponsored legislation is all subsidies and candy. We need as a nation to tighten our belts.\ Alan Eckert\ Santa Fe\ Viable option\ On Aug. 8, Santa Fe City Council has the opportunity to vote on the Homewise proposal for affordable housing on Old Las Vegas Highway. I've lived and worked in Santa Fe for almost 10 years and want to continue doing so. I am a nurse at St. Vincent Regional Medical Center. I want a choice of location and affordability, and the proposed Old Las Vegas Highway neighborhood is the only choice or chance I can see of owning an affordable home close to the hospital. I support the Homewise project, and encourage the City Council to approve it.\ The Homewise proposal is a thoughtful assessment of the needs of the community, taking into account a homeowner's choice for location and affordability and keeping needed workers in the community. The neighborhood proposal also addresses critical issues of energy and water conservation and takes into account the use of public open space and the continuance of natural vegetation.\ Sharon Gurnack\ Santa Fe"
137,"Throughout a Fulbright Fellowship, work for the State Department and his own consulting business for corporate and government clients, Robb Hirsh has been haunted by the feeling that there was more important work to do. \But his efforts to interest people in the impacts of climate change -- ""global warming"" is the buzz-phrase -- generally elicited lukewarm, half-hearted responses. \T hen he got t he k ids involved. \Two years ago, Hirsh and his wife, Numi, created a grass-roots nonprofit called the Climate Change Leadership Institute, aimed at doing Earth stewardship workshops in schools and with youth groups. \Now, suddenly, the Santa Febased movement is taking off. Teens and young adults are fanning out, urging parents, friends and acquaintances to sign a ""Power Pledge"" to live as sustainably as possible. \""I relish working with young people in this endeavor because of their promise, courage and open-mindedness,"" Hirsh said. ""It is young people, after all, who have sacrificed the most during our country's great showings of responsibility to future generations, including the Revolutionary War for independence, the Civil War for unity and emancipation, WWII for freedom over tyranny and the civil rights movement for equality and justice for all."" \The CCLI is conducting a DJ-boosted ""fund-rager"" today to raise money for its programs, including energy workshops, grants to innovative students and a parttime paid student internship next year. Besides the party, raffle tickets are being sold for a 2008 Prius automobile, partially donated by Beaver Toyota, and a new Belgian bike. Tickets are $25 for the car and $5 for the bike. \A $75 ticket to the invitesonly ""rage"" gets a free chance on both raffle items. Because the raffle offers significant prizes, money spent on the tickets is not tax-deductible, Hirsh added. Tickets and more information are available on the CCLI Web site, takeresponsibility.us. \Mara Dauber is a Santa Fe High School student who has been working to raise awareness about climate change and environmental damage. ""We're obviously at a very important time in our history,"" Dauber said. ""We're starting to realize (our) effects on the environment. I don't want our generation to be one that leaves a mess. I believe it's a very important cause. We have to take care of our home."" \Lauren Buchanan, a freshman at Santa Fe Prep, said she had been interested in global warming for a long time. \""The work of getting people to sign the Power Pledge is rewarding, very much so,"" Buchanan said. ""I think this is a very good way ... to create an interest in people being more eco-friendly in their daily lives and having a greener world,"" she said. ""Robb (Hirsh) has been very helpful to all of us who are working toward that end."" \Hirsh said the CCLI offers free workshops on climate change and ways to join the clean energy/conservation solution to schools, student and community clubs, colleges and universities, civic groups, tribal communities, small businesses and public entities. \Perhaps the most powerful tool the Institute has is the Power Pledge, which the young volunteers urge people to sign. It has 26 items its adherents ""solemnly pledge"" to follow, ranging from leading as consumers ""by suppor ting responsible and sustainable businesses and products"" to the last pledge: to ""use the power of imagination for further ways to end fossil fuel pollution, re-energize our democracy and change the world."" \In between are items as large as lobbying the government for a carbon tax and as specific as installing a solar hot water heater system. A PDF of the pledge is available at takeresponsibility.us. \Working with the young people is his primary focus, Hirsh said, because they seem most receptive to the message and most willing to take on the battle for change. But their enthusiasm is not all that's needed. The fight to clean the environment and make the country energysufficient, he said, is going to involve everyone sooner or later, whether people want to join the fray or not. \""All of us, perhaps led most by the baby boomers on whose watch this exorbitant greenhouse gas pollution has all happened, must collectively sacrifice with massive energy conservation, innovation investment and carbon taxes set revenue-neutral to not disproportionately negatively affect working people, and rise up for stewardship in America,"" he said. \TICKETS: \To buy raffle tickets or check for an ""e-vite"" to today's ""fund-rager"" at an as-yet undisclosed location, go to www. takeresponsibility.us"
138," In the president's State of the Union address he told the nation that, ""We are addicted to oil."" That seemed at the time like a rare moment of truth, but it didn't tell us anything we didn't already know. If he was into real candor he would have told us that we are addicted to cheap oil -- and for that matter, cheap natural gas and coal.\ That is why we can have a ""Clear Skies Initiative"" that allows power plants to expand and perform substantial renovations without installing scrubbers and electrostatic precipitators that would remove dirty emissions. That also is why he can tell us that we will have one new coal-fired power plant a week during his term without a plan to sequester carbon dioxide.\ The Sept. 24 article on solar energy, ""Silicon Valley taps into the sun to fuel clean energy needs,"" is perplexing because it reports that one of the leading solar companies in the U.S. (Sunpower) will be building solar equipment in the Philippines.\ Leading scientists who are in the forefront of the effort to convert from fossil energy to renewables have suggested a sort of Apollo program to emphasize the urgency; but, at the same time they have emphasized that building a renewable infrastructure is more labor intensive than the fossil-fuel industries, which are mostly capital intensive.\ As such, the conversion program also will be a sort of New Deal, WPA employment program, creating many high-grade jobs. Every smart developed country has recognized this urgency and has instituted some form of a carbon tax to create capital to subsidize renewable- energy technology.\ Sen. Pete Domenici hinted at the idea of a carbon tax when he said that in some ways it would be better if we continued to pay a lot for gasoline.\ But, of course, he steered clear of saying it in a serious way as something he would propose in Congress.\ To pay more for gasoline is a solution that most would find counter-intuitive and, thus it must only be spoken of in hushed tones or as an ironic comment. We have never employed full-cost accounting, or life-cycle costing in formulating our energy policies.\ What economists refer to as ""externalities"" continue to go unrecognized except by many nonprofits that deal with the unwanted results.\ Our gross domestic product grows, but it is increasingly loaded with the expenses of repairing the damages our short-sighted policies generate to our health and environment.\ J. Russell Tyldesley lives in Santa Fe."
139,"Ask for support of revenue-neutral carbon tax \The film The Great Invisible, shown recently at the Center for Contemporary Arts with former Sen. Jeff Bingaman as special guest speaker beforehand, was about the Gulf oil spill by BP's Deepwater Horizon in 2010. It showed the devastating and lasting effects on the environment, public health and economy of that region. The American taxpayer bears the brunt of accidents like these. Deepwater drilling, halted only briefly, continues to proliferate. It was shocking to learn there are more than 4,000 oil and gas rigs in the Gulf Coast. \Another alarming fact from the film -- income to the U.S. government from off-shore drilling is second only to the income the U.S. government receives from federal income taxes. No wonder Congress is immobilized when it comes to climate change legislation. \Will we ever learn ""that wealth is not in bank accounts and that you can't eat money""? \Contact your representatives. Tell them to support a revenue-neutral carbon tax. \Chrysa Wikstrom \Santa Fe \Enjoyed 'Wisdom Sharing' \The New Mexican gave no coverage to a very special event at Ghost Ranch this past week called ""Wisdom Sharing"" starring Gloria Steinem, Alice Walker and Dr. Chung Hyun Kyung. Several hundred people came, many of them from Santa Fe, and it was a highlight of the year. \There were panels with all three speakers, questions from the audience and several great movies shown in the evenings. Every afternoon, circles were situated around the ranch where Native American teachers or elders brought forth wisdom through their gifts of storytelling, art, weaving and others. \It was an unforgettable and enlightening experience. We can only hope that they will make this an annual event. \Barbara Aran \Santa Fe \Debate sheds light \The debate between Gov. Susana Martinez and Attorney General Gary King was interesting (""Debate gives rivals chance to question each other,"" Oct. 20), pointing up the innate differences between the two. \Martinez's mind is like a broken record, stuck in a redundant, prosecutorial mode down in Las Cruces. She appears stunted, totally lacking in understanding of what civil society is all about. This is her smokescreen, which doesn't succeed in concealing her weakness. She is unfit to govern. \Gary King on the other hand (Ph.D. in organic chemistry and an LLB) completely saw through this smokescreen and repeatedly corrected Martinez's shaky misrepresentations. \Like Dianna Duran, Martinez's whole approach is to unsuccessfully search for a phantom ""gotcha!"" that isn't there, wasting four years accomplishing nothing. New Mexican Gary King will make a good, civil governor who has no hateful ax to grind with any of us, including ""that liberal California"" film business. \Bill Lyne \Lamy"
140,"Thank you so much for the recent article (""For disabled, long wait for aid exacts toll,"" March 8) about the long waiting period for disabled individuals to receive support (Developmental Disability Waiver program). My son has been on the waiting list for about five years, and I was shocked when I first heard that the wait would be 10 to 15 years. \In addition to having an autistic son, my family and I recently opened a nonprofit facility to provide services to adults with developmental disabilities. Collins Lake Ranch, located near Mora, provides supported living services for four adults, with plans to expand our facilities and services. Whether cooking, gardening, helping with the animals, collecting firewood or just walking around the lake and mountains, the residents are prospering in a way they never have before. All of this is only possible because of the support they receive through the waiver program. \Hopefully as this issue gains more visibility, our Legislature will increase the funding for this vital program and allow more individuals and their families to lead a more productive and meaningful life. Thank you again for your attention to this often overlooked sector of our population and the burden the wait time places on their caregivers. \Steve Smaby \founder, Collins Lake Ranch \Cleveland, N.M. \Climate solutions \Regarding ""Study says global warming that brought crazy winters may be driving crazy summers"" (March 12): Thousands of the world's best scientists have told us we'll have ""global economic collapse"" if we keep burning fossil fuels. U.S. taxpayers have paid more than $1 trillion for climate change disasters (NOAA). The U.S. Climate Assessment says we'll soon be paying $1 trillion annually. We'll go bankrupt if we don't phase out fossil fuels. \We could create 2.8 million U.S. jobs and add $75 billion to $80 billion annually to our GDP by transitioning to clean energy with a carbon tax that's paid to us, not by us. Rebate a steadily increasing carbon tax 100 percent, by law, to every American, every month. Same thing with imports from China until they cut their emissions. \Eight Nobel economists agree, and it's worked in British Columbia for six years. See the Citizens Climate Lobby website for more. \Lynn Goldfarb \Northglenn, Colo. \Preserve public interest \Thanks to Steve Terrell for covering House Bill 299, the Public-Private Partnership Act. I have real concerns with the possibility of putting our basic needs such as water and sewer services in the hands of private companies. This bill would enable and encourage that process. This has been tried in other communities, only to see private managers and operators cut corners and jeopardize public health and safety. The costs of this kind of partnership would ultimately be paid by people like you and me as well as our children, since these deals can be 50 years long. I can't believe that a private company would do a better job than a municipally run water utility. I say keep the public works public. No to public-private partnership. \Jan-Michele Gianette \Corrales \Celebrate agriculture \Americans quietly celebrate the nation's hardworking farmers and ranchers during every meal. And National Agriculture Day on March 18 is a good opportunity to reflect and give thanks to those who raise our food and do it right. \Today, U.S. farmers provide us with perhaps the most abundant, safe and affordable food supply in the world -- raising 262 percent more food than in 1950 while using less fertilizer, seed and labor. Consumers are grateful for this, but they also increasingly say they care that animals used in agriculture are well-treated -- 95 percent, according to a recent poll we conducted. \Farmers have always been the front-line stewards of animal welfare, but to demonstrate humane treatment to consumers, many of whom have no experience on farms, more and more farmers are turning to independent, third-party certification programs such as the American Humane Certified program, which now ensures the welfare of more than 1 billion U.S. farm animals. This National Agriculture Day, let's celebrate by looking for humane labeling and supporting New Mexico farmers who not only put food on our tables, but do it in a humane way. \Robin Ganzert, Ph.D. \president and CEO \American Humane Association \Loss for people \HB 299, entitled the Public-Private Partnership Act, is about privatization of basic services. If this bill passes, it means that the private sector could be in control of the building and management of schools, libraries, water works and other public facilities. Such facilities are supposed to serve their respective communities and contribute to the greater good, yet how can this continue when the private sector places profits above the interests of the people? In addition to this fact, the private corporation has no accountability to the voter, just to their shareholders. Ultimately, this bill is a bad idea and should not be allowed to pass. \Lars Panaro \Albuquerque \Dairy conflict \Our legislators are unpaid elected representatives. We expect them to have private interests from their jobs, professions and other sources of income. But when they legislate, we expect them to keep their private interests separate from their public interests as our elected representatives. Sen. Joseph Cervantes represents the dairy industry in New Mexico against community-initiated lawsuits over damages to lives, properties and the environment from illegal or irresponsible dairy operations. But he will have a chance to decide the fate of several bills being considered during the current legislation session that will immunize the dairy industry from any accountability for these practices. He should recuse himself from voting on these bills over this obvious conflict of interest. \ViAnn Beadle \Las Cruces"

Recently one of my colleagues sent me a story that sums up the media's apathetic appetite for covering the environment. It is perplexing and disturbing.
\
The economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment, despite the rhetoric from every GOP candidate.
\
Climate change dropped further from the world headlines in 2011 compared to the previous year even though a viscous one-in-one hundred-year drought in Texas has entered its second year; 70 percent of Mexico is enveloped by its worst drought in 70 years; Australia faced epic flooding costing taxpayers in excess of $5 billion in infrastructure costs; and plants are so confused in their bio-rhythmic cycles that the white petals of snow drops, normally a spring flower, are now unfurling in the National Arboretum in Washington, DC.
\
Clearly, nature is showing climatologists, ecologists, physiologists and oceanographers that the web of life is being brutally dismantled by rising greenhouse gases. Humans are exceptional problem solvers so why has the media chosen not to focus on positive solutions? After all, Americans have the highest concentration of brainpower in our colleges compared to any other nation on the globe.
\
For those that do not believe that anything is going on - walk, ride or fly anywhere across western North America and you'll see vast amounts of dead trees. In the past 40 years across the West, temperatures have risen, on average in excess of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. Although this number appears to be small, it has effectively removed nature's ecological cold curtain enabling mountain pine beetles an opportunity to speed up their life cycle, invade and decimate high elevation pine forests across the continent.
\
Instead of absorbing CO2, billions of beetle-killed trees across the West are decaying and stoking the ever-rising pool of greenhouse gases.
\
Death rates of whitebark and limber pines across Western U.S. are as high as 90 percent, the sentinels of the high country, have become the tsunami sirens of global warming, showing scientists that a warming world is irrevocably altering the landscape across the entire mountainous region of western North America.
\
It's not just the forests that are disappearing but rather immense amounts of ice that reflect incoming solar radiation. One hundred billion tons of ice melted from Greenland during the blistering-warm summer of 2010. This year alone 50 percent of Canada's millennia-old Arctic ice shelves along the coast of Elsmere Island vanished.
\
And far worse, the Southern Ocean which occupies 22 percent of the total ocean on the globe, absorbing 40 percent of Earth's CO2 is acidifying so quickly (as a byproduct of absorbing rising CO2) that by 2030 the sea water will be corrosive to crustaceans, dissolving shells that the animals are making. This amplification will reverberate all the way up the food chain to the whales.
\
Data from the Global Carbon Project showed the carbon emissions from our planet had increased 5.9 percent between 2009-2010; that's the largest jump in any year since the Industrial Revolution.
\
The $17 trillion Albertan oil sands must spend carbon energy and precious fresh water to separate the gooey, toxic oil from the sand. Moreover by burning this petroleum humans will knowingly raise atmospheric CO2 levels by an astounding 150 ppm. Earth will be uninhabitable for life as we know it.
\
If Australia with its $10 trillion coke-coal industry can ratify a carbon tax then surely we in America can set a low-carbon standard that China and India will follow.
\
We are running out of time to combat rising CO2 emissions: Earth's forests are dying.
\
It's time to embrace innovation and the cofounder of the London School of Economics, George Bernard Shaw's dictum: ""Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.""

With the dramatic elimination of Osama Bin Laden came an important psychological boost to the American people. There is a collective sense that there's nothing we cannot do if we set our minds to it. Along with that boost came an important upswing in President Obama's approval ratings. At 51 percent approval rating in his 10th quarter as president, he is a full 7 percentage points ahead of Ronald Reagan's approval rating in his 10th quarter. With that upswing comes the responsibility to use his recharged political capital to tackle our greatest national (and international) threat climate change and to take advantage of this opportunity to fuel a new green economy.
\
Clearly feeling optimistic, President Obama made an important speech about our energy future. Clean energy, he said, will help us out-compete and out-innovate the rest of the world. ""Clean-energy jobs are the jobs of the future. I don't want other countries to win the competition for these technologies and jobs. I want America to win that competition. I want America to win the future.""
\
So do we. That's why the president needs to use his replenished political capital and increased approval ratings to push Congress for comprehensive climate and energy legislation that holds oil companies accountable and reduces our dependence on oil while protecting the environment.
\
We need a National Climate Act implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The president should propose a stringent carbon tax or an economy-wide cap-and-trade program with stringent timetables over several decades. If Congress again fails to act, then use the EPA's rulemaking authority that the Supreme Court verified in 2007. Inaction is not an option.
\
We must implement a comprehensive clean-energy plan for high-quality jobs, economic growth, cleaner air, water and food, and for the reduced dependence on foreign oil that will come as a result. The sooner we pass such legislation, the sooner we build a thriving green economy ? and have the jobs and economic growth that will come with that thriving green economy.
\
Just over a year ago we had one of the world's largest oil spills in a region that a few years before had been torn apart by a catastrophic hurricane. During this past year we have seen the resounding defeat of climate legislation; a major turnover in Congress; the rise and now dominance of China in what had been our solar market to lose; the rise in credibility of climate deniers; an increase in extraordinary weather events; multiple countries experiencing the hottest year on record; and an unthinkable nuclear accident caused by a tsunami. Take the Mississippi River's recent flooding and ravaging the residential areas around it; and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's visit to Greenland coincided with a new report that revealed the ice cap is melting at devastatingly high levels much higher than earlier anticipated.
\
America is a ""can do"" nation with the persistence, tenacity and talent to succeed. It's time for the Administration and Congress to join the American people with the same kind of persistence, tenacity and talent to work to gain America's freedom from oil, regain our technological supremacy, and protect our natural resources.
\
Neither our economy nor our planet can afford any more delays.

143,"A scientific study reported at the Joint Assembly in Montreal this past May indicates that humans are dumping extra carbon into the atmosphere at a rate unprecedented since at least the time the dinosaurs went extinct. ""Not a single event during the past 66 million years released carbon as fast as we're releasing now,"" paleoclimatologist Richard Zeebe reported. \The scientific evidence is unequivocal that human activity is a major contributor to global warming and climate change, and that global warming and climate change are an existential threat to humanity. The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that ""we must switch mostly to renewals by 2050 and phase out fossil fuels by 2100 to avoid the most damaging and potentially irreversible impacts of climate change."" Ominously, a July research report in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Journal warns that ""2 degree C global warming is highly dangerous"": Climate modeling predicts increasing ""ice melt, sea level rise and super storms."" \Comprehensive action to combat climate change and global warming cannot wait. It demands top priority as an issue with the United States public and for action at all levels of government. However, this is not the case. A Pew Research poll of the public's policy priorities for 2015 places the environment at 13th with only a 51 percent rating, even though 46 percent of the public believes that global warming is a very serious problem. In Congress, the party in power has no priority to combat global warming. There are still deniers, and there are those who acknowledge global warming but question that human activity has contributed significantly. \Some states are taking the lead: California has an ambitious cap-and-trade system. Nine Northeastern states take part in a regional cap-and-trade system. Here in New Mexico, we were a participant in the Western Climate Initiative, a cap-in-trade consortium of Western states and Quebec, but it fell apart in 2011. What remains is Western Climate Initiative Inc., a nonprofit formed to develop administrative and technical services to support the implementation of state and provincial greenhouse gas emissions trading programs. \A letter published Oct. 1 in The Washington Post and the Financial Times from 10 of the world's biggest food companies ""urged Congress to support a strong global agreement on climate action in advance of the U.N. climate talks happening this December."" This may have some influence, but I believe that to get Congress on board, the risk of action versus no or delayed action must be quantified by scientific organizations (e.g. our Santa Fe Institute) and economists in terms of cost-in-dollars for specific environmental systems, geographic locations and populations affected by global warming and climate change. For example, a report compiled for the insurance industry by the U.K.-based Tyndall Centre in 2009 warned that a possible rise in sea levels by 2050 ""could put at risk $28 trillion worth of assets in the world's largest coastal cities."" On the flip side, a new report by NextGen Climate America found that transitioning to a clean energy economy would be an economic boon to the United States, adding a million jobs by 2030 and 2 million jobs by 2050. \We have the technology to combat global warming; we need the political will to implement it. Senate Resolution 244, submitted in August, details the risk and the consequences of delayed action. It should be passed on a bipartisan basis before the December world conference. The U.S. must join other developed countries and put in effect a meaningful cap-in-trade system or carbon tax. Here in New Mexico, we should lead an effort to revive the Western Climate Initiative. \Fred Bender is a concerned citizen and a retired mining-related metallurgical engineer.\Credit: Fred Bender"
144,"\(Bloomberg) -- Canada's climate-change plan and other government measures are heaping costs on businesses and pushing them to a breaking point, the Chamber of Commerce says in a warning to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\Chamber President Perrin Beatty, in a letter Tuesday, asked Trudeau to find ways to cut business costs to offset the impact of an emissions plan that includes a minimum carbon price beginning next year. Failure to do so could mean “seriously undermining Canada's competitiveness,” he said.\“The cost of doing business in Canada is rising,” Beatty said in the letter, which was also sent to the country's provincial premiers. “Our members are deeply worried about their ability to both grow their businesses within Canada or compete for investment and customers from abroad.”\Environment Minister Catherine McKenna responded to the letter by saying the government is already “putting competitiveness and growth for the middle class at the heart of policy-making.” McKenna cited employment growth in the Canadian economy -- 350,000 jobs in the past 12 months -- while saying businesses are hiring “because they're confident in our plan” for growth. She thanked the Chamber for its “support for climate action.”\“The strongest economies of the next century will be those that nurture business transition and attract companies that want to invest in climate committed jurisdictions,” the minister said in a statement, adding she speaks often with businesses “who don't see this global shift as a competitiveness problem, but rather as a cutting-edge opportunity.”\‘Suffocate' Warning\A cocktail of new regulations, taxes, climate measures and pension changes are having a “serious cumulative impact,” Beatty said. The business community supports measures to tackle climate change but argues they should be accompanied by cutting costs elsewhere, he said. High labor costs, low productivity growth, electricity rates and employment insurance changes are also raising costs. “If we don't give Canadian businesses breathing room, many will suffocate,” Beatty added in a press release.\In Ontario, where the government recently announced a proposed increase of the minimum wage to C$15 per hour by 2019, the self-assurance of smaller firms has already been shaken. June data from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business shows the barometer index, a measure of business confidence, fell 10.2 points to 58, the biggest monthly decline since 2008. Nationally, the index dropped 5.2 points, the most in almost six years.\The proposed changes in Ontario drove the decrease in business sentiment across Canada, and are “adding considerable uncertainty over future operating conditions,” Ted Mallet, chief economist at the CFIB, said in the report.\The Chamber's warning comes ahead of upcoming negotiations on the North American Free Trade Agreement and amid U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to cut taxes and regulations. Canadian “concern becomes even more substantial when we see the determination of the U.S. administration to dramatically cut both regulation and business taxes in that country,” Beatty wrote.\Climate change is one of the foremost policy differences between Trump and Trudeau. The president pulled the U.S. out of the Paris agreement last month, while Trudeau continues to champion it at home and abroad.\“The solution is not to ignore climate change, but to proceed in a way that makes sense for Canada's economy,” Beatty said. “We believe that the negative impact of carbon pricing mechanisms on competitiveness can be minimized if they are designed with competitiveness in mind and offset by cost reductions in other areas.”\Trudeau's climate plan kicks in next year, though Canada's most populous provinces already have either a cap-and-trade regime or a carbon tax. Beatty urged Trudeau and the premiers to discuss competitiveness at their next meeting.\(Adds Canada government comment in fourth and fifth paragraph.)\To contact the reporters on this story: Josh Wingrove in Ottawa at jwingrove4@bloomberg.net, Erik Hertzberg in Ottawa at eschmitzhert@bloomberg.net.\To contact the editors responsible for this story: Theophilos Argitis at targitis@bloomberg.net, Chris Fournier, Stephen Wicary\cc2017 Bloomberg L.P.\Credit: Josh Wingrove and Erik Hertzberg"

Business people are realists above all, and they are recognizing that cap-and-trade schemes will not change a thing. Only carbon taxes and tariffs can lead to the phase-out of traditional polluting power sources.
\
Without a carbon tax, investors will not commit to renewable energy, and global warming will continue.
\
President Obama is disappointing voters on climate change, and the feeling is probably mutual. Please remember, Obama cannot impose a solution for global warming or any other massive problem, including the deficit. He can only lead where voters want to follow.
\
That is why we (the people) need to start demanding carbon taxation, loudly and incessantly, until everyone in Washington gets the message.
\
Americans do have the political will power to overturn the status quo. They demonstrated that in the presidential election.
\
We know change is possible. These days, almost everyone understands that the switch to renewable energy is necessary for economic success, as well as for a healthy environment.
\
But people should also understand that affordable clean energy alone is not enough to prevent climate change, or even to boost the economy.
\
It's very simple: Big Coal, the oil cartel, and nuclear power will always be willing to sell energy a little cheaper than the green competition.
\
After all, they are already heavily invested in those particular resources. Extraction is essentially free for them, because they burn their own carbon sources to do the work.
\
That is how Canada has hit the jackpot with tar sands. This incredibly destructive product is enough to wreck the climate by itself, if it is all burned.
\
Apparently they are tired of the snow up there, and they are doing something about it.
\
I will give the Canadians this though: No nonsense about clean coal, nuclear fusion, or carbon sequestration. Business and politics should be so honest in America.
\
The good news is, people all over the world want a solution for global warming. The bad news is, some giant corporations are ready and willing to convert all the hydrocarbons and uranium ore on Earth into greenhouse gases and toxic waste.
\
We must defend ourselves. It's time for voters to demand direct taxes on American producers of non-renewable energy, along with reasonable tariffs on products from countries like Canada that continue to grow the problem.
\
It is also time, I believe, for the Obamas and the Bidens to rally the majority of citizens who have been silent so far, to start protecting our long-term interests.
\
People are very worried about the growing federal deficit, even more so than about global warming. One good way to start back towards balanced budgets would be to replace the cap-and-trade approach with a new system of environmental surcharges and tariffs.
\
Obviously, that would be a colossal source of new revenue.
\
Americans have been paying attention. Working and unemployed citizens are already expecting higher prices at the gas pump because of the environmental costs of oil.
\
But far more important, most people expect rich corporations and individuals to start paying their full share of the cost of government.
\
Voters are outraged that the United States is on the hook for trillions because of predatory financiers. People want a much higher tax for the top bracket, and they want it now.
\
The majority of voters also think the wealthy (and greedy) corporations that are polluting the planet should start paying stiff taxes on their carbon and waste production.
\
But demands by the public are not enough. Effective change on global warming and the deficit will require bolder action from the President and Congress than we have seen so far.
\
Don't get me wrong: Barack Obama is the right person for the job. American voters wanted peace, first and foremost, and Obama is delivering. U.S. foreign policy today is based on cooperation, not conquest.
\
The campaign to reform health care is also a plus for this Administration.
\
Perhaps most important, Obama has steered the country clear of a Bush-caused economic disaster. Now more spending is needed for infrastructure, and he is taking action to create those jobs.
\
Still, if President Obama wants a stable future for his family and everyone else, he will have to become more audacious than ever.
\
Despite the risks, Barack Obama and Joe Biden should resolve to lead a political surge of committed citizens and legislators this year, to pass the crucial reforms this country needs.
\
Jerry Yeargin is a long-time resident of the Taos area.

147,"\(Bloomberg) -- Canada's climate-change plan and other government measures are heaping costs on businesses and pushing them to a breaking point, the Chamber of Commerce says in a warning to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\Chamber President Perrin Beatty, in a letter Tuesday, asked Trudeau to find ways to cut business costs to offset the impact of an emissions plan that includes a minimum carbon price beginning next year. Failure to do so could mean “seriously undermining Canada's competitiveness,” he said.\“The cost of doing business in Canada is rising,” Beatty said in the letter, which was also sent to the country's provincial premiers. “Our members are deeply worried about their ability to both grow their businesses within Canada or compete for investment and customers from abroad.”\Environment Minister Catherine McKenna responded to the letter by saying the government is already “putting competitiveness and growth for the middle class at the heart of policy-making.” McKenna cited employment growth in the Canadian economy -- 350,000 jobs in the past 12 months -- while saying businesses are hiring “because they're confident in our plan” for growth. She thanked the Chamber for its “support for climate action.”\“The strongest economies of the next century will be those that nurture business transition and attract companies that want to invest in climate committed jurisdictions,” the minister said in a statement, adding she speaks often with businesses “who don't see this global shift as a competitiveness problem, but rather as a cutting-edge opportunity.”\‘Suffocate' Warning\A cocktail of new regulations, taxes, climate measures and pension changes are having a “serious cumulative impact,” Beatty said. The business community supports measures to tackle climate change but argues they should be accompanied by cutting costs elsewhere, he said. High labor costs, low productivity growth, electricity rates and employment insurance changes are also raising costs. “If we don't give Canadian businesses breathing room, many will suffocate,” Beatty added in a press release.\In Ontario, where the government recently announced a proposed increase of the minimum wage to C$15 per hour by 2019, the self-assurance of smaller firms has already been shaken.

151,"
NASA's climate change evangelist, James Hansen, recently visited New Mexico.
\
He was speaking in Santa Fe at the Lensic Theater with a follow-up presentation the next day at the Santa Fe Institute. Both were primarily attended by fans carrying copies of his book: Storms of My Grandchildren: The Truth About the Coming Climate Catastrophe and Our Last Chance to Save Humanity. However, four scientists also attendeda meteorologist, a
\
physicist, a biologist, and a geologist.
\
No transcript of the speech is available, however the Santa Fe New Mexican covered Hansen's presentation at the Institute, during which he predicted catastrophes, such as rising seas and species extinctions ""if carbon-based fuels continue to be used at the same rate as today."" He believes ""efforts to stem climate change will be ineffectual as long as fossil fuels remain
\
the cheapest form of energy,"" and therefore he ""proposed a new tax for carbon emissions from oil, gas and coal."" Yet, he stated: ""Government shouldn't be making decisions as to what the next energy sources are. Let the marketplace make the decision."" He wants a tax to make fossil fuels unattractive, but the government should let the marketplace decide? Clearly he doesn't understand how the ""marketplace"" works.
\
""That wasn't the only nonsensical idea he presented,"" the scientists told me. Robert Endlich, the meteorologist, reported: ""One item after another struck me as being completely at odds with measurements. For instance, Hansen claimed Earth's energy balance is out of balance, and we are warming rapidly, but recent global surface temperatures of land and water have not increased and, in fact, many measures show cooling over the past 17 to 19 years. In the US, there has not been a new state maximum temperature record set since 1995, and, in spite of the claims to the contrary, July1936, is still the warmest month on record, set when CO2 was less than 300 parts per million. CO2 is now 395 PPM.""
\
Bernie McCune holds degrees in both engineering and biology and has worked with both the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. ""Hansen admitted there is still some question,"" McCune said. ""But, his presentation was mostly political and didn't prove that CO2 is the problem; it didn't show that humans had anything to do with it.""
\
Jerry Clark, the physicist, who has spent 30 years tracking data from the relay satellite system, talked to one of the organizers before the meeting. The young man was surprised to learn that not all scientists agreed with Hansen. Clark feels frustrated because ""the opportunity for opposing views to receive equal time and billing with Dr. Hansen does not exist; nor will
\
the apologists engage in data comparisons."" Instead of the short-term charts Hansen presented, Clark wants to see the data and the real records. Drawing from his experiences on his college debate team, Clark was surprised that ""Hansen didn't even try to justify his thesis of man-made global warming.""
\
John Clema looks at the geologic history when he says: ""Hansen's claim of ""extinction of 30 percent to 50 percent of animal species' is nothing more than shameless spreading of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. More than 98% of all the plants and animals that we currently know of are from the fossil record. There is no evidence that connects CO2 to these extinctions other than the strong possibility of linking huge volcanic activity to some timeframes where extinctions have occurred. In the geologic record, there are times when we've had much higher CO2 than at presentyet there are few recognizable extinctions. Nor is there any link between CO2 from fossil fuels and global warming. We are still in an interglacial period were warming could be expectedbut Hansen can't prove any part of this is due to human activity. Warm and wet is good for our species, cold and dry is not.""
\
At the end of Hansen's presentation, there was a brief question and answer time. Only four questioners got answers. In response to Endlich's question:
\
""Observations show 10 years of warming from 1988 to 1998, but steady and by many measures, even falling temperatures sincea period over 17 years where the temperature has not risen at all. The total rise since 1988 has been only 0.2-0.3 C. To what do you attribute the poor performance of that prediction?"" Hansen first acknowledged the sun's involvement, then he denied that the globe had not warmed.
\
Even Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change acknowledges a ""17-year pause in global temperature rises, confirmed recently by Britain's Met Office."" At Melbourne's Deakin University, Pachauri said: ""People have to question these things and science only thrives on the basis of questioning."" He continued: ""no doubt about
\
it,"" it is good for controversial issues to be ""thrashed out in the public arena.""
\
Pachauri's Australian speech invited traditional scientific give and take, yet Hansen refused additional discussion with the scientists. When Endlich showed data from the Vostok and the Greenland ice cores, Hansen blew him off, saying: ""you are wrong!"" End of discussion.
\
The Santa Fe New Mexican's headline for Hansen's visit was: ""a steep energy tax to curb global warming."" Was Hansen tipping his hand, confirming the rumor that Obama will approve the long-delayed, but much-needed Keystone pipeline if Congress will approve a carbon tax?
\
Just what our teetering economy needs: new taxes = higher energy prices.

153,"\(Bloomberg) -- “This ain't your daddy's oil,” the commercial proclaims, cutting to shots of spray paint being made and a wall covered in fanciful graffiti. “Oil strikes a pose. Oil taps potential. Oil pumps life.”\Oil, in short, is cool, the industry's branding braintrust has declared. The 30-second spot rolled out this year is part of a broader American Petroleum Institute campaign to “raise awareness about the role natural gas and oil has in economic growth, job creation, environmental stewardship, and national security.” Dubbed Power Past Impossible, the ads by the lobbying arm of America's oil giants are all about millennials, the generation of roughly 21 to 35 year olds which out-sizes any other and makes up the largest chunk of the American workforce.\“It's a shift in our messaging and our target that's been in the works for several years,” says Marty Durbin, the institute's chief strategy officer. “There isn't a company out there that isn't chasing the elusive millennials.”\That may be true, but there are few with the kind of uphill battle the oil industry faces in catching them. Millennials often frown on companies whose main products play a key role in global warming. A 2016 poll by the University of Texas found that 91 percent of those under the age of 35 said climate change is occurring and just over half supported a carbon tax. About two thirds of millennial-aged voters said energy issues influenced how they vote and that they plan to by an alternative fuel vehicle.\“What exactly were you guys thinking making a commercial aimed at young people?”\The spray paint ad, it turns out, got a decidedly mixed a reaction.\“What exactly were you guys thinking making a commercial aimed at young people,” tweeted one viewer. “Every time I see it I'm reminded of how [expletive] of a resource petroleum is ecologically and how dumb it was to advertise ... that way.”\Millennials prefer brands that come across as “conscious capitalists,” explained Jeff Fromm, an expert in marketing to younger Americans. “Any mature industry has to think about the fact that there's a new sheriff in town with new values, new spending habits,” he added, referring to millennials. “Legacy brands often have that challenge.”\Beyond reintroducing the brand, the Big Energy ad blitz has a more daunting task: convincing millennials to work for the industry. In the coming years, fossil fuel companies expect “to see a big turnover, sometimes called ‘the big crew change,'” Durbin says. “We started to reach out to different demographics”cwomen, veterans, minorities”cto educate them on what the industry does and to learn what would pique their interest.”\Getting millennials to take these jobs, which tend to pay well but come with their own risks, won't be easy for an additional reason. Unemployment is at a 16-year low and talented engineering graduates are flocking to Silicon Valley for internships and first jobs that pay more than the median national wage. This adds even more pressure on the oil industry to spiff up its image, insofar as it can, to lure young workers with lots of choices.\Asking a millennial to work for an oil company instead of Tesla is a tough proposition.\“Oil and gas companies may need more profound changes to meet demands for meaningful work and social responsibility to attract the next generation of top engineering and leadership talent,” McKinsey & Co. wrote in a September 2016 report on the future of the oil sector. Asking a millennial to choose between a green-tech company like Tesla Inc., which makes cars that don't pollute, and an oil company, which fuels those that do, is a difficult proposition.\The consulting firm found 14 percent of millennials would reject a career in oil because of the industry's image. That's the highest of any industry polled by McKinsey. Only 2 percent of American college graduates list the oil and gas sector as their first choice for a job, according to research by Accenture, a professional services company.\Even among those unsure of their path, the news isn't good. Less than half of millennials without a set career find appeal in oil and gas, according to the recently released EY U.S. Oil and Gas Perception poll. Women were more likely to reject the industry than men. And its only going to get worse as time goes on: The generation after millennials, commonly referred to as ‘Z', turned their nose up at oil jobs even more frequently.\Part of the issue, EY found, was a disconnect between what millennials want from a job and what oil executives think they want”cand it has nothing to do with the environment. Asked what they prioritize in a job, 56 percent of millennials said salary, followed closely by work-life balance, job stability, and job happiness. Industry executives thought far more millennials were driven primarily by salary, an anachronistic viewpoint that may illustrate the generational challenge faced by their branding campaign.\Millennials have a similarly dated outlook, it turns out. EY found they view the oil industry as packed with roughnecks, and the work as “blue-collar, dangerous, and physically demanding,” despite much of the sector being office-based and engineering-focused.\Accenture, in a recent report, said most sectors facing a professional talent crunch can rely on new college graduates to fill vacancies.\“That's not the case for oil and gas operators,” Accenture said. “Many millennials believe the sector is lacking innovation, agility, and creativity, as well as opportunities to engage in meaningful work.”\At the very least, this perception is what the American Petroleum Institute says it hopes to change. “Millennials are interested in innovative, high technology industries,” Durbin says. “If they don't have that view of our industry, we have the opportunity to change that. If you want to go into high-tech engineering, look at our industry.”\Durbin concedes the ad campaign won't change the mind of every millennial. “ There are those out there who we are never going to get,” he says. “ There are some who are going to say ‘I don't like the industry.'”\But Durbin, and oil companies in general, may be happy with just letting people know there are jobs to be had, even if the campaign invites abuse from some young people who see fossil fuels as a blight.\“ It's a very different flavor from what we had done before,” Durbin says. “ It's gotten people talking.”\To contact the author of this story: Polly Mosendz in New York at pmosendz@bloomberg.net.\To contact the editor responsible for this story: David Rovella at drovella@bloomberg.net.\cc2017 Bloomberg L.P.\Credit: Polly Mosendz"

Voting for Obama doesn't make blacks racists
\
Regarding Larry L. Hassenpflug's letter (""Black voters' support of Obama shows racism,"" June 16), blacks have voted in nearly the same percentages for white Democratic presidential candidates. If a few more did so because Obama is black, blacks do not suddenly become racist. Meanwhile, white males like you have voted only for other white males and, in Obama's two runs for office, voted in even larger percentages for those distinguished white males John McCain and Mitt Romney. By your logic, such voting makes those white males racist, and you, too.
\
I almost forgot: an increased percentage of white women voted for Obama -- because he is a white woman, right?
\
As for assimilation, you obviously think that it means blacks acting like whites -- a racist doctrine if there ever was one. We can debate the merits of the culture of whites who make up, or sympathize with, the various white Christian supremacist groups -- racist to the core -- at another time, but because the majority of the country will soon be non-white, perhaps you had better start thinking of assimilation as whites acting like non-whites (you can pick the non-white minority with which you want to assimilate).

World War II veteran looks back at D-Days past
\
While a Marine on an LST working its way west as part of an extensive fleet, an announcement came across the loudspeakers that the invasion of France had begun. Isolated as we were from the rest of the world, we didn't know much about what was happening. All we knew was that particular D-Day had taken place. We had our attention focused elsewhere, since we were to have our own D-Day on some island somewhere in the Pacific. We were finally told where we were to attack, Saipan, and the day was to be June 15, nine days after the June 6, 1944, invasion of Europe.
\
With our invasion, as with that on Normandy, not everything went as planned.
\
The relatively small detachment of Japanese soldiers turned out to be many times larger and were well-situated to cause extreme numbers of casualties on the Marines and the Navy personnel involved.
\
Saipan, and the neighboring island of Tinian, which was secured a month or more later, were needed because they were within flying distance of Japan. When the large airfields on the two islands were repaired, the relatively new B-29 bombers would leave for their bombing forays.
\
I was involved in another D-Day the next year, Feb. 19, 1945, the beach on the small island of Iwo Jima. Not long after that, Marines and other troops had their own D-Day on the island of Okinawa. We were beginning to train and prepare for the ultimate D-Day to be Oct. 1, 1945, on Japan, when the war was stopped by the two bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Knowing now what was being prepared for us, the carnage on both sides would have been unbelievable. I would not have made it home and obviously would not be writing this memory of those D-Days long past.

Costs from weather disasters not rising
\
The June 10 Sun-News Opinion page featured Jim Morin's cartoon with a storm cloud, ""Natural Disaster Costs"" approaching the U.S. Capitol and the caption, ""a carbon tax to stop climate change, we can't afford it!""
\
The cartoon states Morin's belief that human-caused CO2-fueled climate change is upon us and causing great increases in storm damage, and follows the Obama administration's attempt to use the EPA to accomplish what the Democrat-controlled Congress could not during the 111th session of Congress from 2009-2010: increase taxes on our energy use.
\
Let's look at data on actual storm damages, based on testimony before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on July 18, 2013.
\
Dr. Roger Pielke Jr.'s statement had these highlights:
\
""It is misleading and just plain incorrect to claim that disasters associated with hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, or droughts have increased on climate timescales in either the United States or globally. It is further incorrect to associate the increasing costs of disasters with the emission of greenhouse gasses.
\
Globally, weather-related losses have not increased since 1990 as a proportion of GDP (they have actually decreased by 25 percent; insured catastrophic losses have not increased as a proportion of GDP since 1960!
\
Hurricanes have not increase in the U.S. in frequency, intensity of normalized damage since at least 1900. The same holds for tropical cyclones globally since at least 1970, when data allows for a global perspective.
\
Floods have not increased in the U.S. in frequency or intensity since at least 1950. Flood losses as a percentage of U.S. GDP have dropped by about 75 percent since 1940.
\
Tornadoes have not increased in frequency, intensity, or normalized damage since 1950, and there is some evidence to suggest that they have actually declined.""
\
Morin's Political Cartoon is unhindered by facts.

155,"New Mexico has the opportunity to be a leader in setting energy standards that are good for the environment, as well as for utility customers and shareholders. \All that needs to happen is for the Public Regulation Commission to adopt standards being proposed both by the state Attorney General's Office and consumer advocates. The proposal is simple: Electric utilities would be asked to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants serving in-state customers by 4 percent a year through 2040. \The called-for reductions would eliminate several million tons of carbon dioxide from spilling into the air. Both good for the state and the planet, moving to cleaner energy sources also could assist utilities. By adapting earlier, in a more gradual way, the utilities would avoid the costs of eventual environmental regulations that are sure to be adopted as the threat of climate change is better understood. \It's understood by most thinking beings -- scientists, military leaders, business types, politicians and others -- that the changing climate threatens the globe, as well as the bottom line. Corporations will have a harder time making a profit if they are spending dollars rebuilding because of weather catastrophes or if customers can't buy consumer goods because discretionary dollars are going to fix damage caused from a hurricane or a wildfire. \Investor-owned utilities understand the coming reality, including New Mexico's largest electric provider, Public Service Company of New Mexico. Already, PNM is preparing to close portions of its coal-fired plant in northwestern New Mexico by the end of the year. The company is adding more solar energy under a plan submitted to regulators and has invested almost $270 million in solar generation facilities. \Change is happening. So much so, that Steve Michel, energy policy chief with the environmental group Western Resources Advocates, thinks PNM is poised to meet proposed standards with its current plans. His group, the Attorney General's Office and Prosperity WORKS are behind the request to the PRC for a Clean Energy Standard rule. If it's already happening, why set standards? \Because under President Barack Obama, the United States understood the need to curb carbon emissions. That urgency is no less true today, but the current administration is more interested in burning coal than eliminating it as a fuel source. President Donald Trump has said the U.S. is pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord, an agreement of nearly 200 nations to reduce carbon emissions. (Lately, there have been tweets saying the U.S. might stay in the Paris agreement, but either way, Trump wants to produce and use more fossil fuels for energy, not transition to alternative energy sources.) \Without national leadership, states and cities will have to step up to offer ways to reduce carbon emissions. Setting standards in New Mexico will give utilities solid guidelines for the future -- no surprises, in other words. \Should New Mexico's regulators adopt these standards, we would be joining similar efforts in California and in nine Eastern states taking part in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The PRC should, at the very least, consider adoption of the Clean Energy Standard. By issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking, the regulatory body would open up the matter for discussion and eventual adoption. That would be good for New Mexico -- both for citizens and corporations.\Credit: The New Mexican"

SILVER CITY The evidence that the climate is growing warmer is overwhelming, but the usage of greenhouse gas-producing fossil fuels is not decreasing, said retired U.S. Senator and former Silver City resident Jeff Bingaman.
\
Bingaman was in Silver City on Friday speaking on energy and climate challenges for the Western Institute for Lifelong Learning at Western New Mexico University's Global Resource Center auditorium.
\
Bingaman's talk was titled ""Meeting the World's Energy and Climate Challenges,"" and the former senator discussed the world's use of fossil fuels and the importance of aligning energy and environmental policies.
\
During his career in the Senate, Bingaman earned a reputation as being an advocate for the environment.
\
Bingaman and former Secretary of State and Treasurer George Shultz co-authored ""The State Clean Energy Cookbook"" last year, Bingaman said. Published by the Stanford University Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance, the report is available at the website steyertaylor.stanford.edu/statepolicyreport.
\
""The report observes that with growing gridlock in Washington, states throughout the country -- both red and blue -- are implementing innovative renewable energy and energy efficiency programs which could be adopted by their neighbors to improve their economies and reduce emissions cost-effectively,"" the website states.
\
These policies could be particularly valuable for states in meeting pending regulations by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to cut carbon emissions.
\
According to the website, the report reaches ""an encouraging conclusion"" noting, ""Both red states and blue states are turning green -- whether measured in dollar savings or environmental improvement.""
\
Bingaman has served as an elected official both in the state of New Mexico as well as representing the people of this state in the United States Senate.
\
He was born in El Paso and attended public schools of Silver City, according to a news release from the Western Institute for Lifelong Learning.
\
He graduated from Harvard University in 1965 and then from Stanford Law School in 1968 which led to his admission to the New Mexico bar that year. He became assistant New Mexico attorney general in 1969 and a counsel to the state constitutional convention in 1969. He entered private law practice in 1970. He served in the United States Army Reserve from 1968-74, according to the release.
\
Bingaman was elected attorney general of New Mexico and served from 1979-82. In 1982, he was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate and served in that capacity for 30 years.
\
Bingaman's Senate career included being chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, as well as serving as a member of a number of committees, including the Armed Services Committee, Finance, Joint Economic Committee, and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
\
Since 2006, Bingaman had worked on a bill that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions via a ""cap and trade"" system. His goal was to see his plan implemented so that emissions would be reduced to 1990 levels by 2030. In the Senate, Bingaman was a backer of the Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012, which would have given federal help to all low-carbon electricity producers. It did not pass.
\
In February, 2011, he announced that he would not seek re-election for a sixth term in 2012. Upon his retirement, Bingaman accepted a fellowship at Stanford in 2013 to specialize in renewable energy.
\
Bingaman served as a distinguished fellow for one year, working to develop policies to assist states and local communities in promoting increased use of clean energy.
\
In 2014, ""The State Clean Energy Cookbook"" was published by Stanford University.
\
Getting a control on greenhouse gases has been a focus of Bingaman's environmental policies, and by implementing efforts at the state level, from the bottom up, Bingaman said there was hope for eventual change.
\
""Whether or not that change will be enough, or will come in time to reverse the damage that we have done with our emissions, we don't know,"" Bingaman said.
\
As Western countries begin looking at improving the quality of the environment, the emerging nations of the world, especially China, are rapidly increasing their use of fossil fuels and the resultant emissions.
\
Meanwhile, improving the environment at home entails cost, and power companies are loathe to pay the initial expense of moving to alternative energy sources, which would ultimately land on the consumer, he said.
\
""Bringing an end to carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere would be reflected in the cost of energy, which means higher prices, and there is great resistance to that, both from the consumer and the energy companies,"" Bingaman said.

As fall approaches, working-class families find themselves struggling with rising energy costs that consume an ever-larger percentage of their disposable income. As the decades roll by, it seems that more and more of our paychecks are required just to keep the lights on, the car running and the house warm in winter.
\
Unfortunately, our national leadership appears increasingly unresponsive to the tectonic changes affecting the middle class. The solutions to problems always seem to follow the gambler's desperate strategy of doubling down on the current bet to make up for previous losses. The current energy proposal coming out of Washington follows this same losing strategy. The administration's Clean Energy Standard, now under discussion in the Beltway, looks to be the only major energy legislation to be worked before the next national election. It contains even more funds for the three dirtiest fuel sources; natural gas, coal and oil development. It commits Americans to the same bundle of fossil fuel resources, which are increasingly expensive, difficult to extract and costly to clean up.
\
Most egregious is the attempt to sell the public the same set of fuels as clean, via new miraculous technologies. Carbon capture from coal-powered electricity is still largely unproven and not enacted. Oil development always carries risks of spills similar to the BP gulf disaster and Yellowstone pipeline spill
\
Technological innovation has done nothing to prevent these accidents. The Yellowstone spill alone is assessed to cost more than $42 million to clean up, and has led to more than 100 damage claims from local residents. The cleanup efforts only found and removed 1 percent of 420,000 gallons spilled. The rest will remain in the environment, affecting local wildlife, ranchers and farmers until natural systems break the hydrocarbons down. It seems that doubling down on bad energy ideas knows no end. Consider the ongoing debate on the Keystone XL pipeline, which is projected to stretch 2,000 miles from Alberta, Canada, to Texas. TransCanada, the company touting the pipeline, already admits it expects 11 ""significant spills"" to occur along its route during the next 50 years. That's a significant spill every 4 1/2 years for the next half century. Technology does not make dirty fuel sources clean and safe.
\
Likewise, the continued investment in nuclear power is stunning in light of the ongoing disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan. In late summer, a Japanese official said that residents might not be able to return to their homes within the exclusion zone ""for decades."" If so, Japanese towns like Okuma and Futaba will join Chernobyl in the history books as radioactive ghost towns. The commitment to continued nuclear investment in the United States is even more outrageous considering the danger to operations from increasingly recurring ""once in a lifetime disasters."" Flooding in the Midwest required sandbagging efforts at the Fort Calhoun Nuclear plant in June, and Hurricane Irene prompted the shutdown of the Oyster Creek Nuclear plant in New Jersey. Neither plant experienced enough damage to affect public safety, but the continued effects of natural disasters causing the shutdown of U.S. plants highlight the potential for disaster.
\
So as fall approaches, let's consider some actions that deal with our rising energy costs while not pushing the same failed strategies. Renewable energy sources continue to drop in price and rise in efficiency. They could provide good paying jobs to a public at 9 percent unemployment. Other countries are massively investing in these industries, but U.S. leadership seems devoted to pushing the same ineffective game plan. America can do better, should do better and needs to do better if we want to resolve the energy and unemployment predicament facing millions of Americans.

President Barack Obama's State of the Union address Tuesday night included praise for natural gas and American energy development.
\
Here is the relevant portion of Obama's speech, according to a White House transcript:
\
"" ... And nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy. Over the last three years, we've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I'm directing my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources. (Applause.) Right now -- right now -- American oil production is the highest that it's been in eight years. That's right -- eight years. Not only that -- last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past 16 years. (Applause.)
\
But with only 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, oil isn't enough. This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy. (Applause.) A strategy that's cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs.
\
We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly 100 years. (Applause.) And my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy. Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade. And I'm requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use. (Applause.) Because America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk.
\
The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don't have to choose between our environment and our economy. (Applause.) And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of 30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock -- reminding us that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground. (Applause.)
\
Now, what's true for natural gas is just as true for clean energy. In three years, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the world's leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries. Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of Americans have jobs because of it.
\
When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance. But he found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan. Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts. Today, it's hiring workers like Bryan, who said, ""I'm proud to be working in the industry of the future.""
\
Our experience with shale gas, our experience with natural gas, shows us that the payoffs on these public investments don't always come right away. Some technologies don't pan out; some companies fail. But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy. I will not walk away from workers like Bryan. (Applause.) I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here.
\
We've subsidized oil companies for a century. That's long enough. (Applause.) It's time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that rarely has been more profitable, and double-down on a clean energy industry that never has been more promising. Pass clean energy tax credits. Create these jobs. (Applause.)
\
We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives. The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change. But there's no reason why Congress shouldn't at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation. So far, you haven't acted. Well, tonight, I will. I'm directing my administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power 3 million homes. And I'm proud to announce that the Department of Defense, working with us, the world's largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history -- with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year. (Applause.)
\
Of course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy. So here's a proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings. Their energy bills will be $100 billion lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, more jobs for construction workers who need them. Send me a bill that creates these jobs. (Applause.)
\
Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America's infrastructure. ... ""
"
159," New Mexico is still in the dark when it comes to lights in the night.\ And an Arizona astronomer is hoping to enlighten New Mexico about the value of dark skies.\ ""Losing a view of the universe is criminal,"" said David Crawford, an astronomer at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson and director of the International Dark-Sky Association.\ ""I think of it as a night Sierra Club,"" he said of the organization, which has members in more than 50 countries.\ Arizona towns have passed laws protecting night skies for astronomers and star gazers, making it a ""dark state,"" he said. The dark-sky group hopes New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah pass similar laws.\ ""It is very easy to show ... that in the U.S. we use $2 billion a year just to light up the sky,"" he said.\ While overlighting and lights that shine upward are part of the problem, he said, the real culprit is mercury vapor lights, the bright, white lights that have been the hallmark of street corners, freeways and parking lots for decades.\ Because of energy conservation priorities, MV lights have nearly disappeared from many cities, replaced by energy-efficient sodium lights that emit a soft, pink light. But some New Mexico towns say they cannot afford quick replacement of the offending bulbs. Almost half of Albuquerque's 21,000 street lights, for example, are still MV, said Ron Hassett, of the city's traffic engineering operations office.\ Most New Mexico towns replace MV lights as the lights burn out, an approach that costs more in the long run, a Davis, Calif., official said.\ Whole neighborhoods of MV lights usually were installed at once and will burn out about the same time, said Davis city electrician Bruce Breault. Piecemeal replacement forces crews to go repeatedly into the same neighborhood, he said.\ But Davis, a town of about 50,000 that is known nationally as a leader in energy conservation, has an advantage: Pacific Gas and Electric paid Davis to trash MV lights.\ ""Virtually anything I do that saves energy, they will write me a check for,"" Breault said. The utility paid Davis from $50 to $100 for each MV light removed because the utility has opted to pay for energy conservation rather than build more power plants, he said.\ Public Service Company of New Mexico spokesman Rick Brinneman said that the California utility can offer such incentives because it probably is operating under state-approved, demand-side management laws that allow it to pass conservation costs on to the customer, just as they pass on the costs of new power plants.\ New Mexico has no such laws, and PNM cannot afford to absorb such costs, he said.\ New Mexico is accepting comments on just such demand-side management laws through April 15, said Public Service Commission spokesman Tom Halpin.\ But demand-side laws were not why Public Service Company of Colorado got rid of MV, said spokesman Mark Stutz. The utility owns and operates the street lights in several major Colorado cities and decided to be rid of MV a number of years ago, he said. The lights are inefficient, costly to run and just plain antiquated, he said.\ ""It was just good business to get rid of them,"" he said. ""When you conserve, the fact is in the course of a couple of years, it will pay for itself.""\ Albuquerque owns its own street-lighting system, but contracts with and must pay PNM crews to change burned out fixtures, Hassett said.\ ""If someone calls us up and tells us a bulb is getting dim or they want it changed, we tell them it doesn't get replaced until it goes completely out,"" he said.\ Nonetheless, Hassett said, he wants to convert to sodium.\ ""They give us more light for less power,"" he said.\ The delay causes more energy loss, he said. As MV lights age, they lose efficiency down to zero, he said. In contrast, output from sodium lights improves as they age until the lights suddenly burn out, he said.\ In Santa Fe, PNM also contracts with the city to maintain street lights and change burned-out bulbs, Brinneman said.\ ""When we change them out, we go to a more efficient light,"" he said.\ He said the Santa Fe area has about 5,000 street lights, but he did not know how many MV lights have been replaced with sodium ones.\ Santa Fe transportation director Craig Watts also did not know how many MV lights remain, but the lights cannot be removed faster without new funding from the City Council, he said.\ ""We don't have a time frame whether five, 10 or 20 years from now (for the lights' removal),"" he said.\ Los Alamos runs its own utility and street-light systems and will be rid of MV by 1995, said traffic engineer John Bennett. He is concerned because the bright light of MV sometimes fools trees into growing in the fall when they should be going dormant, resulting in winter damage.\ ""They are not kind to the environment, so the sooner we can get rid of them the better,"" he said."
160," Terms of Permit Figure in Dispute\ Intel maintains that 38 instances of scheduled downtime or failures of the company's air pollution abatement equipment have not caused a violation of its state-issued minor-source air pollution permit.\ New Mexico Environment Department spokesman Jon Goldstein said pollution control equipment at the microchip-making plant was down for 600 hours last year, or a little less than a month's time total. He said some of the equipment has been down for a total of 210 hours this year.\ When the equipment is down, untreated emissions are released into the air.\ Last month, the department requested more information from Intel about the equipment's downtime in order to evaluate the company's excess emission reports.\ Intel must file the reports when its equipment is down for maintenance or repair. It uses a calculation to estimate the volume of the emissions released during those times.\ Mindy Koch, the company's environmental health and safety manager, wrote in a response to the department's request that the request does not apply to Intel because excess emissions are calculated annually, and not by using an hourly rate.\ ""Intel is surprised by this recent request for additional information on EERs dating back to January of 2002,"" she wrote.\ Environment Secretary Ron Curry said Wednesday that the department has the authority to request the information. ""I think the fact that they are complying with our request speaks volumes and we're happy with that,"" he said.\ On Wednesday, company spokesman Terry McDermott said Intel does not report excess emissions on the excess emission reports when pollution control equipment is down.\ He said that when the permit was negotiated with the state, the company chose to report downtime on excess emission report forms, but the incidents themselves do not mean that excess emissions exist.\ For the plant to have an excess emissions violation, the amount of chemicals released must push the company over its 96.5-ton limit for volatile organic compounds and/or its limit for hazardous air pollutants of 24 tons per year.\ A little more than three years ago, one of the plant's thermal oxidizers failed, releasing almost 500 pounds of pollutants into the air for 3 1/2 months before the problem was found and corrected.

166," Environmentalists aren't terribly optimistic about the upcoming session of the New Mexico Legislature.\ Nor are those hoping to see tougher DWI laws.\ Gregory Green, president of Conservation Voters Alliance, says environmentalists are afraid they may see several industry-sponsored attempts to weaken state regulations that protect public health and the environment.\ One way such protections could be diminished is by requiring proposed environmental laws to undergo a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. This would entail weighing the cost to industry of installing environmental protection devices against the benefit such devices provide to the public.\ While such an approach might seem reasonable, Green said it would actually work against the promulgation of new regulations to ensure that New Mexico's air and water are clean. The problem, according to Green, is that it's much easier to quantify the cost to industry of a proposed regulation than it is to quantify the benefit to the public.\ Environmentalists say they may also see ""takings"" bills that would provide compensation to private property owners who are affected by environmental laws such as the Endangered Species Act.\ The state version of the wildlife act, amended two years ago, also may come under attack during the legislative session. Environmentalists also fear that attempts may be made to weaken the 1993 State Mining Act, which imposes relatively tough restriction on industry.\ Yet another progressive piece of legislation, the 1995 state subdivision act, may also come under attack. Attempts were made last year to delay the implementation of the act, which imposes requirements on developers designed to protect, among other things, water supplies and archaeological sites.\ ""We wouldn't be surprised to see amendments that try to weaken"" the act, Green said.\ One issue that will definitely be hotly debated during the legislative session is deregulation of the electric utility industry.\ Environmentalists are already talking to the main advocates of deregulation big power users such as Phelps Dodge mining company and Intel, the Rio Rancho computer giant.\ Deregulation holds out the promise of providing cheaper electricity to New Mexico businesses and residents.\ But Green said the voters alliance has a couple of concerns.\ One is that legislation could get passed that would provide cheaper electricity to big business and leave smaller commercial customers and residential users out in the cold.\ Another unpleasant scenario, according to Green, is that cheaper electricity might mean dirtier air in New Mexico, where electric plants are coal-fired.\ As a result, environmentalists are pushing for a couple of concessions such as an ""emissions tax"" that would impose a higher tax rate on utilities that spew large amounts of pollution into the air.\ Environmentalists also want a requirement that utilities in a deregulated environment be required to have 10 percent of their power produced from so-called ""clean sources,"" such as solar or wind power. Green said such a requirement would probably have to be phased in over several years.\ Landfill companies may try to weaken the state solid waste act, which requires a 100-foot buffer zone between landfills and ground water supplies.\ One of the few progressive pieces of legislation that has positive implications for public health and the environment could be introduced by Rep. Max Coll, D-Santa Fe, who is expected to introduce a bill that would strengthen protections for state ""whistleblowers.""\ On the DWI front, there almost certainly will be another push to ban the selling of alcohol through drive-up windows, says Linda Atkinson of the DWI Resource Center in Albuquerque. Atkinson said legislation may also be introduced that would not allow convenience stores to sell both alcohol and gasoline.\ ""They'd have to make a choice,"" Atkinson said.\ Atkinson said she also hopes to see local option excise tax legislation. This would allow counties to raise taxes on alcohol the idea being that this would act as a disincentive to frequent alcohol purchasers.\ Atkinson said anti-DWI advocates also want to see vehicular homicide changed from a third-degree felony to a second-degree felony. There may also be an effort to make it mandatory that a drunk driver under 18 who kills someone be treated by the judicial system like an adult.\ Atkinson said many if not all of these measures have been proposed in previous state legislative sessions only to fail in the face of the powerful liquor lobby.\ ""I'm not any more optimistic this year than I have been in the past,"" Atkinson said."
167," Gov. Gary Johnson, ballyhooing savings for the public in the gasoline tax cut bill that he signed Thursday, said, ""There are too many people who can ill afford what amounts to several hundred dollars a year in unnecessary gasoline costs.""\ Johnson must have been thinking of someone with a really long daily commute, like between El Paso and Santa Fe.\ Johnson's own Taxation and Revenue Department has figured out that the 3 cents a gallon gasoline tax reduction that will go into effect July 1 should save most drivers between $15 and $40 a year.\ Someone who drives 15,000 miles a year with a car that gets 28 miles per gallon will save all of . . . $16.05. In a 15 miles per gallon gas guzzler, the savings would be $30.\ Based on the Taxation and Revenue numbers, a driver who makes the Albuquerque-Santa Fe round trip every week day for 50 weeks a year will save between $30 and $60 annually on the commute.\ For the full 6-cents per gallon tax cut in the bill -- that includes making permanent a 2-cent temporary tax cut that's been in place since last year and taking another penny off in the year 2003 - - the estimated savings for most drivers would be $30 to $60 a year.\ All of this assumes, of course, that gasoline prices will go down and stay down because taxes are cut.\ Several legislators have suggested that gas sellers will pocket the 3 cents in tax savings that become effective in July and that consumers will never seethe savings. Gas sellers, citing market forces, have offered no guarantees about what will happen to at-the- pump prices after a tax cut.\ Sen. Cynthia Nava, D-Mesquite, let Mark Weidler off easy during a hearing on his confirmation as Environment Department secretary.\ Nava wanted to know if all of Weidler's top deputies are male. Weidler noted that he had retained Tracy Hughes as the department's chief legal counsel. Weidler described Hughes as a ""very attractive, very competent lady.""\ The reference to Hughes' appearance provoked some hallway gossip about workplace sexism, but Nava didn't make an issue of the remark.\ If a bill that would keep government from requiring no-smoking areas in businesses that are open to the public reaches Gov. Gary Johnson's desk, he'll have to decide which is more important to him: his usual stance against government regulations or his personal aversion to smoking.\ Johnson said Friday that he hadn't seen the bill, which has passed the Senate and is moving through the House committee process. But he said, ""I really think smoking is bad for your health.""\ And he said that while he's been accused of being an anti- government libertarian by Senate President Pro Tem Manny Aragon, smoking may be an area where he's non-libertarian. ""A libertarian would say you can do whatever you want,"" Johnson said. He implied that when it comes to smoking, he doesn'taccept that idea.\ The lead sponsor of the bill against government smoking restrictions is. . . anti-libertarian Manny Aragon.\ The timing for the Senate's first soiree at the governor's mansion during the Gary Johnson era couldn't have been better. It took place last Wednesday night, a couple of hours after the Senate's Democratic majority had angered Johnson by slapping down Eugene Lovato, Johnson's choice for secretary of the human services department, in a vote rejecting Lovato's confirmation.\ Various sources indicate there were no fisticuffs at the mansion event -- although one Republican senator complained that health enthusiast Johnson had served only light beer. Johnson said the event went fine. ""I wore a little sticker that said, `Kick me,' "" the governor said."
168," Imagine this scenario:\ Gov. Gary Johnson, who campaigned on the promise to abolish the 6- cent gasoline tax, has been in office less than six months when one of his Cabinet secretaries shows up at a legislative committee meeting to ask for more money. From a gasoline tax.\ Impossible?\ It happened Friday, when Environment Department Secretary Mark Weidler told Legislative Finance Committee members that an environmental clean-up fund nearly gutted as a result of the gasoline tax repeal will be $1.1 million in the red without more money.\ Weidler said the extra money could come from a 1-cent fuels tax that, in the repeal compromise, was split between the clean-up fund and the local government road fund. The 1990 1-cent tax originally went to the clean-up fund, which pays to clean contaminated gasoline storage tank sites.\ The 1-cent tax poured $11 million annually into the fund. As a result of the compromise, the fund now nets half that. Yet the department is expecting requests for money to clean contaminated sites to triple in the next three years, Weidler said.\ ""I'd like that half-cent that goes to the road fund,"" Weidler said.\ The response was unequivocal.\ ""You're not going to get another penny in gasoline taxes from this Legislature,"" Sen. Shannon Robinson, D-Albuquerque, told Weidler.\ Robinson said the governor, a political novice when he ran for office, ""really ought to hang his head today.""\ ""What you say to run on and get elected and what you have to do to run the state are two different things,"" Robinson said. ""This administration is starting to find that out.""\ Weidler said he was asking for the gas tax money on his own, not at Johnson's direction. Weidler said new accounting procedures that were started when he took over the department revealed the state had obligated $6 million from the fund but had not shown that obligation on the books.\ If the state has to pay all the obligations before the end of the fiscal year, the fund will be in the red, Weidler said.\ The $5.5 million annually that the half-cent tax generates for the fund will not be enough to pay for cleaning all the contaminated sites in the state by 1998, as required under federal law, Weidler told finance committee members.\ He outlined plans to streamline management of clean-up efforts and consolidate the department's equipment to save money. But Weidler would not say whether he will be able to save enough to keep the fund in the black and keep a $3 million operating reserve required by law.\ Legislators made it clear where responsibility for resolving the fund's problems lie.\ ""This is a serious matter,"" said Rep. Luciano ""Lucky"" Varela, D- Santa Fe. ""Let the governor propose a solution for us in an executive message.""\ Johnson's spokeswoman Catherine Bedell said Thursday the governor expects to be reviewing options for dealing with the funds problems very soon."
169,"SANTA FE — A proposal to nearly triple New Mexico’s gas tax rate over the next five years advanced Friday, despite opposition from Republican lawmakers.\The measure, House Bill 173, would generate more than $300 million in additional revenue by the 2024 budget year and would split the money up three ways — for statewide road repairs, a new clean infrastructure fund and prorated rebates for low-income New Mexicans.\It was supported Friday by multiple high school-age students, who described the legislation as a novel way to fund climate change efforts.\“Now is the time to invest in a cleaner environment, which will lead to a thriving economy,” said Tabatha Hirsch, a student at Santa Fe Prep.\But critics said it would hurt New Mexico families and called it unnecessary with the state sitting on a massive budget surplus.\“I am shocked that Democrats are continuing to burden hard-working New Mexicans with increased taxes,” said Rep. Jason Harper, R-Rio Rancho.\New Mexico’s current gas tax rate of 17 cents per gallon has not been increased since 1993 and is one of the lowest in the region, according to a fiscal analysis of the bill.\However, the proposed 30-cent surtax — that would be gradually implemented — would make the gas tax rate one of the nation’s highest by 2026, according to the analysis.\The bill is described by supporters as “The Next Generation Transportation Act” and is sponsored by Rep. Matthew McQueen, D-Galisteo. It passed the House Taxation and Revenue Committee on a party-line 8-4 vote and now moves on to the House appropriations committee."

What are the Republicans thinking? Just two days into the new GOP-controlled Congress, they put higher gas taxes on the table.
\
The Jan. 8 Wall Street Journal stated: ""Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman James Inhofe (R., Okla.), who just took the reins of the panel, said he is open to considering raising the gas tax as a way to help pay for the dwindling Highway Trust Fund that keeps up the nation's roads and other transportation infrastructure."" Inhofeis supported by Senators Orin Hatch (R-UT) and John Thune (R-SD).
\
However, leadership from both Houses of Congress opposes a gas-tax increase.
\
The gas tax creates headlines because the Highway Trust Fund (HTF), which finances the interstate highway system, faces insolvency due to spending more than its revenues. Had Congress not come up with a solution to the $16 billion shortfall by Aug, 1, 2014, federal highway projects would have ground to a halt. An agreed upon ""patch"" put the crisis off until after the elections. That fix ends in May and the new Congress must now come up with another way to fund America's roads and bridges.
\
The tax current tax is 18.4 cents a gallon for gasoline and 24.4 cents for diesel -- more than double the oil companies' profit on that same gallon of gas. With gasoline prices at historic lows, many think now is the time to raise the tax, as it will hardly be noticed.
\
But other options don't require raising taxes.
\
The fact that modern cars are more efficient than they were when the gas-tax was first instituted is a major problem with HTF funding -- a problem exacerbated by electric cars which use the roadways for free while everyone else pays for them. Therefore many have proposed mileage-based user fees (MBUF) rather than a gas tax -- or in addition to it.
\
However, because MBUFs are collected through ""smart technology,"" they should concern everyone worried about more government involvement in our lives. At last year's consumer electronics show, Jim Farley, then Ford's head of marketing, said: ""We know everyone breaks the law. We know exactly when you do it because we have a GPS sensor in your car."" With more than two thirds of today's vehicles being ""connected,"" one doesn't have to be a conspiracy theorist to imagine the data collection morphing into a Big Brother-like intrusion.
\
MBUFs should be implemented only for electric vehicles -- and therefore do not create the full answer to the HTFs funding woes.
\
Limit spending to actual highway projects -- not mass transit or nature trails.
\
Gas taxes used to be more of a user fee -- which made it fairer. But since the 1990s the HTF supports projects that don't contribute to it. Cutting non-highway spending would go a long way to closing the funding gap.
\
Another part of the solution, would redirect highway projects to the states that already have their own Departments of Transportation. Each state has very specific infrastructure needs that are best met at the local level.
\
States can more easily innovate and have already solved some highway issues with toll-concession private-public partnerships (PPPs) in which a consortium takes on the risks that would otherwise be borne by the government -- hence, the taxpayers. The principal funding source is tolls charged to users of the highway project.
\
I've outlined just four possible options to fund our roadways without raising the gas tax -- which will still exist when gas prices go up. Surely, the great minds in Washington could come up with more ideas -- without raising taxes.

172,"
What are the Republicans thinking? Just two days into the new GOP-controlled Congress, they put higher gas taxes on the table.
\
The Jan. 8 Wall Street Journal stated: ""Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman James Inhofe, R-Okla., who just took the reins of the panel, said he is open to considering raising the gas tax as a way to help pay for the dwindling Highway Trust Fund that keeps up the nation's roads and other transportation infrastructure."" Inhofe is supported by Senators Orin Hatch, R-Utah, and John Thune, R-S.D.
\
However, leadership from both Houses of Congress opposes a gas-tax increase.
\
The gas tax creates headlines because the highway fund, which finances the interstate highway system, faces insolvency due to spending more than its revenues. Had Congress not come up with a solution to the $16 billion shortfall by Aug. 1, federal highway projects would have ground to a halt. An agreed upon ""patch"" put the crisis off until after the elections. That fix ends in May.
\
The tax current tax is 18.4 cents a gallon for gasoline and 24.4 cents for diesel -- more than double the oil companies' profit on that same gallon of gas. With gasoline prices at historic lows, many think now is the time to raise the tax, as it will hardly be noticed.
\
But other options don't require raising taxes.
\
--MBUFs for electric cars
\
The fact that modern cars are more efficient than they were when the gas-tax was first instituted is a major problem with Highway Trust Fund funding -- a problem exacerbated by electric cars, which use the roadways for free while everyone else pays for them. Therefore many have proposed mileage-based user fees, or MBUFs, rather than a gas tax -- or in addition to it.
\
However, because MBUFs are collected through ""smart technology,"" they should concern everyone worried about more government involvement in our lives. At last year's consumer electronics show, Jim Farley, then Ford's head of marketing, said: ""We know everyone breaks the law. We know exactly when you do it because we have a GPS sensor in your car.""

173," * What state thought was two projects in San Juan Basin could be just one\ One pipeline or two?\ At first glance, it looks as though two companies are competing to increase natural gas output in the San Juan Basin with nearly identical pipeline plans.\ One company is asking for up to $150 million in state help; the other is not.\ The State Investment Council agreed last week to consider investing up to $150 million in Shawnee, Kan.-based Earth, Energy & Environment's plans to build a pipeline from the Farmington area to connections with major interstate pipelines. The proposed pipeline would have a capacity of about 375 million cubic feet per day.\ One day after the council's vote, Transwestern Pipeline Co., owned by Enron subsidiary Crosscountry Energy Corp., received federal approval to expand its existing line from Bloomfield to Gallup by 375 million cubic feet.\ The two projects may in fact be the same one, one state official said Monday.\ ""I feel safe saying we're talking about one pipeline here,"" State Investment Council spokesman Charles Wollmann said.\ He declined to go into detail about any possible connections between the two.\ Dennis Langley, CEO of the Kansas corporation, said confidentiality agreements barred him from saying whether his company's project was related to the Transwestern's announcement. Nor would he comment on whether his firm has or was planning to bid on the Transwestern pipeline, which is on the auction block in the Enron bankruptcy-protection court case.\ But he did say, ""I do not view that as being a competing project.""\ State Land Commissioner Patrick Lyons, who also serves on the State Investment Council, told the Journal on Monday that the council was aware that Transwestern was seeking federal approval.\ Lyons said some of the material provided to the council indicated that the Kansas company was interested in working with Transwestern but did not specify how.\ Transwestern has not approached the State Land Office for permission to expand into right of way owned by the state, Lyons said. The Kansas firm, however, has worked extensively with the office, he said.\ ""We've been looking for a company to put an extra line in there for years, and no one's done it,"" he said. ""But (Earth, Energy & Environment's) moving forward.""\ Transwestern vice president of public and government affairs John Ambler said he was not familiar with Earth, Energy & Environment's plan.\ He said his firm was nearing agreements with Navajo and private land owners in the area, and that their existing right of way only ran through state-owned land for about half a mile.\ Oil and gas revenues\ Lyons, who has in the past been the lone skeptic of investments presented to the council, added that he supported the council's decision to consider the investment in Earth Energy & Environment because the $11 billion in permanent funds overseen by the council largely comes from oil and gas revenues.\ ""That's how that money is made,"" he said. ""If we can get to those reserves, we can make more money.""\ About 95 percent of the state's $363 million in oil and gas tax revenues last year was generated in the San Juan Basin, he said.\ Bob Gallagher, president of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, said last week he was more familiar with Transwestern's proposal and was unaware of any connections between the two.\ Though his group didn't endorse either project, he called the recent developments ""a significant and great day for the oil and gas industry"" and the state.\ ""We've said for years there is a need for additional capacity,"" he said. ""Once that need becomes justified, private companies will step up.""\ But Gallagher said he didn't know if the basin could make use of two new 375 million cubic feet per day pipes.\ ""It would seem to me to be a stretch,"" he said.\ Goal of 2006\ The Earth, Energy & Environment proposals are still in the early stages, Langley told the Investment Council, and are dependent on agreements with other gas pipeline companies. The target date to complete the line is 2006.\ Besides the new pipeline in the San Juan Basin, the firm is negotiating with a Mexican pipeline firm to build a line that would eventually connect the San Juan Basin with markets south of the border.\ Transwestern says its $138.4 million expansion would begin in October and should be finished by mid-2005. It was approved Wednesday by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and is expected to be finished in about a year.\ In June, the state Attorney General's Office, on behalf of several state pension and permanent fund managers, including the State Investment Council, filed a successful motion to allow the state to consider a bid on the 2,600-mile Transwestern pipeline if it chooses. The bidding closes in September.\ State officials said last week that a new pipeline in the San Juan Basin would result in millions of dollars in gas royalties and tax dollars for the state.\ Thousands of wells have been capped due to limited pipeline capacity.\ The council voted last week to consider a $130 million to $150 million bond investment for Earth, Energy & Environment's proposal.\ Gov. Bill Richardson urged caution before investing that amount and plans to revisit the proposal soon."
174,"Don Schreiber grew up in oil country and, following in his father's footsteps, provided insurance to oil and gas companies in Farmington for two decades. He moved his family to a ranch in Rio Arriba County in 1999, into an area densely populated by more than 120 oil and gas wells. That move, Schreiber said, altered his understanding of the industry and the environmental pollution that accompanies it. \""It just is impossible to know what is going on until you are in that field as a landowner,"" he said. \Schreiber says the impact of wells leaking methane is visceral and inescapable. He says the pollution is not only present in the smell of the air, but also alters the water quality and entire ecosystem of his ranch. He said no one living with a well on their property would support overturning a federal rule requiring oil and gas operators to prevent methane leaks. \Everyday ""you are trying to shelter yourself, your grandkids, your horse,"" he said. \Schreiber was one of a number of environmental advocates and lawmakers who spoke at the state Capitol on Monday about the need to capture methane pollution in New Mexico -- the primary component of natural gas and the second-most potent greenhouse gas -- and uphold the federal methane waste rule, which is under attack in Congress. \A group led by Camilla Feibelman, director of the Rio Grande Chapter of the Sierra Club, delivered a 1,000-page petition to the Governor's Office asking her to reconsider her opposition to the federal methane rule. \New Mexico has the largest concentration of methane pollution in the nation, with a 2,500-square-mile cloud of methane the size of Delaware suspended above the Four Corners region. Roughly $100 million is lost annually in the state because of natural gas wasted in production, according to research consultant firm ICF International. \The federal rule was promulgated by the Obama administration's Bureau of Land Management in November. It requires well operators on public and tribal land to reduce methane pollution by installing leak-capturing technology, conducting more rigorous monitoring and limiting the practice of venting gas into the environment. \Those who support the rule say it will not only protect the environment and public health from methane pollution, but will save the federal government and states millions in royalties that are lost when operators release excess quantities of methane into the atmosphere. \Alongside methane, chemicals like benzene, a common chemical and byproduct of methane that is linked to leukemia, are released. \New Mexico's Democratic congressional delegation, Santa Fe Mayor Javier Gonzales, state Attorney General Hector Balderas and state Auditor Tim Keller are among 40 elected officials who have been vocal in their support for the rule. \Republicans in Congress moved this year to appeal the rule under the Congressional Review Act, an action that would not only nullify the rule, but would prohibit the BLM from developing regulations that are substantially similar in the future. A Senate vote is expected this month. \The federal repeal is supported by the oil and gas industry, federal and state Republicans leaders and U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M., who say the rule should be overturned because it would be too costly to the industry, hurting profits and, in turn, states like New Mexico because of lost royalties and oil and gas tax revenues. \The rollback is in keeping with the Trump administration's promises to do away with Obama administration regulations and open up oil and gas drilling in pursuit of American energy independence. \State Sen. Benny Shendo Jr., D-Jemez Pueblo, also introduced a measure in late February, Senate Memorial 102, asking the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department to produce a report on how much natural gas is vented and flared in New Mexico, as well as what oil and gas operators plan to do to capture gas. The measure has the support of 16 other state senators. \New Mexico's Democratic U.S. Sens. Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich have written a number of letters to their Senate colleagues urging them to oppose the appeal. \Jon Goldstein, a policy manager with the Environmental Defense Fund, said no state has more at risk than New Mexico because unlike other states, New Mexico ""has no state regulations to fall back on."" \House Speaker Brian Egolf, D-Santa Fe, said the methane rule is a ""rare opportunity for our state to have a triple win"" that benefits business, the environment and the budget. \He said the House has been looking for every way to remedy the state's budget deficit and, in the Four Corners region, a significant revenue source ""is literally going up in smoke."" \""We don't have a backstop,"" in New Mexico without the federal rule, he said. \Remind ""Governor Martinez [and others] that they are not tools to the will of some corporation,"" said Schreiber, the Rio Arriba County rancher. ""They are caring people and we can believe in them. They, like you, would uphold the BLM waste rule if it protects their family, and it does."" \Contact Rebecca Moss at 505-986-3011 or rmoss@sfnewmexican.com.\Credit: Rebecca Moss The New Mexican"
175," HOUSE WILL CONSIDER BILL-TRIMMING LEVY\ SANTA FE -- New Mexicans would get a gasoline tax cut but no new income tax cuts under an agreement announced Friday by Democratic legislative leaders.\ The plan would bring gasoline taxes down to 17 cents a gallon on July 1 and subtract another penny by 2003. That would take care of the 6-cent tax increase that passed in 1993 and that Gov. Gary Johnson vowed to repeal, they said.\ The tax has been at 20 cents a gallon since 2 cents were suspended temporarily last year.\ The Senate passed the tax cut 24-18 Friday evening, while House members were due to consider the bill on the floor today.\ All Republicans and three Democrats -- Sens. Manny Aragon and Tom Rutherford of Albuquerque and Sen. Elizabeth Stefanics of Madrid -- voted against the bill.\ Republicans complained the bill does not reduce the tax by 6 cents immediately. ""The voters stated they want 6 cents back. We don't need to be playing political sleight of hand with pennies,"" said Sen. Skip Vernon, R-Albuquerque.\ Aragon said he doesn't think the state can afford a tax cut, and Stefanics said she doesn't believe the cut will lower prices at the pump.\ Lawmakers decided to focus on the gas tax cut because ""someone else made a commitment,"" said Sen. Ben Altamirano, D-Silver City, referring to Johnson. ""If we don't do something, we'll be in a logjam for sure.""\ Democratic legislators had argued that income tax cuts are a surer way to provide relief, but public anger during last year's political campaign focused on the last gas tax hike.\ ""The phenomenon of the gas tax will go away, but the public will not benefit from it,"" said Rep. Ben Lujan, D-Santa Fe.\ Now, there's no room for further income tax cuts, as proposed both by Johnson and by an interim legislative committee, they said. A $12 million personal income tax cut, the second phase of a three-year reduction passed last year, will take effect, they said.\ Legislators also expect to consider a gross-receipts tax exemption for prescription drugs as part of a tax cut package this year.\ The gas tax package would permanently repeal a nickel of the tax right away while reducing the final penny when current highway debentures are paid off. That date is scheduled for 2003. Revenues from that penny are pledged to help pay off about $50 million worth of bonds.\ Johnson proposed that approach in a meeting with lawmakers Thursday evening, according to Rep. Max Coll, D-Santa Fe. The governor didn't make a commitment to supporting the specific package, though, they said.\ ""I think it will be agreeable to everybody,"" said House Speaker Raymond Sanchez, D-Albuquerque. ""He (Johnson) wants to hold his options open.""\ Tax Secretary John Chavez said Johnson has a positive attitude toward the gas tax agreement but added the governor still has to consider other pieces of the puzzle.\ Under this package, the local government road fund wouldn't lose all the money it had been getting from the gas tax increase. Transferring other revenue sources assures local road funds will get to keep about $12.7 million of the $16.7 million they had been getting, according to Rep. Jerry Sandel, D-Farmington.\ A cleanup fund for underground storage tanks also will be able to keep half of a tax now going to it. Lawmakers had considered repealing the tax that pays for that fund, but they decided to keep the fund active to try to protect the environment from leaks, Sandel said.\ The legislative approach will take $15.3 million out of the general fund, compared to $34 million that would have been lost under the way Johnson had proposed various transfers, Lujan said. The legislative approach will help prevent the need for tax increases to replenish the general fund, he said."

Max Coll, D-Santa Fe. Johnson's plan, which would reduce general fund revenues by $80 million, was dead as soon as analysts announced lower revenue estimates earlier this month, he said.\ Legislators also expect to consider a gross-receipts tax exemption for prescription drugs as part of a tax cut package this year.\ The gas tax package would permanently repeal a nickel of the tax right away while reducing the final penny when current highway debentures are paid off.

177," Light 'em up ... while you can: The annual push to ban smoking at the state Capitol (HB10) cleared its first hurdle Thursday, when the House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee unanimously approved the bill.\ Under current law, people can smoke in the Roundhouse's private offices and the Senate and House lounges.\ The Capitol is the only building in the state complex where this is permitted.\ Rep. Gail Beam, D-Albuquerque, said a television news reporter who just moved to New Mexico told her he was ""appalled"" to learn people could smoke in the Roundhouse.\ Rep. Patsy Trujillo Knauer, D-Santa Fe, harped on the point that people use the lounges to consume food and find it nasty that people were puffing away in those areas.\ At last -- an end to cheap gasoline: Two Republican senators are pushing legislation aimed at repealing ""the Indian gas-tax loophole"" that has driven many motorists to buy gasoline on Indian reservations.\ The New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department derives most of its road-building revenue from a tax imposed on gasoline sales.\ Indian reservations, however, don't have to pay this tax to the state -- which estimates show could cost the state highway department more than $20 million next fiscal year.\ The Senate bill, for which no number was available late Thursday, would require Indian gasoline distributors to pay the tax.\ ""We continue to see operating costs for roads increase, while revenues decline,"" said Sen. Carroll Leavell, R-Jal, in a news release.\ The state relies on gas-tax revenues to pay for improvements to about 2,400 miles of roads that aren't eligible for federal funds, Leavell said.\ ""New Mexico's economic outlook is bleak, but there are many projects that must be funded,"" said Sen. Don Kidd, R-Carlsbad, the bill's co-sponsor.\ Inmate treatment: A proposal cruising through the Legislature would allocate money so nonviolent drug and alcohol offenders can receive in-patient treatment rather than incarceration.\ Rep. Gail Beam, D-Albuquerque, is pushing the idea (HB64), which received unanimous approval at the House Judiciary Committee meeting earlier this week.\ ""Substance-abuse treatment instead of incarceration is an excellent long-term investment for the State of New Mexico,"" Beam said in a news release. ""We save money in the short run because the treatment programs cost less than prison, but if we can cut the recidivism rate, we can achieve longer-term savings as well.""\ According to the release, in-patient substance-abuse treatment costs about $50 a day while incarceration costs about $78 a day.\ Beam's bill would allocate $250,000 -- enough to pay for 5,000 days of in-patient care.\ The lawyer fight: The second week of the 2002 Legislative session saw Gov. Gary Johnson wield his well-worn veto pen and strike out part of HB1, the so-called feed bill that pays for the legislative session.\ The issue was money the Democrat-controlled legislature wanted to allocate to pay legal bills that stacked up as a result of the redistricting fight. Johnson wanted the Legislature to allocate money for his lawyers, too.\ When he didn't get some, he line-item vetoed the entire appropriation because, in his own words, ""it wasn't fair.""\ Minority Leader Rep. Ted Hobbs, R-Albuquerque, introduced a bill Wednesday to fix the fight over the governor's legal counsel (HB251).\ According to a news release, Hobbs' bill is modeled after a similar one that passed Utah's Legislature in 2000. The bill will clarify who represents the governor and other executive-branch officials when there's a conflict of interest between those officers and the attorney general's office.\ ""This is a government efficiency bill,"" Hobbs said in a release. ""It takes the politics out of litigation involving the state and ensures that government officials will receive zealous and loyal representation in the courts.""\ Teach a man to fish: When a New Mexican decides to ""Be all you can be"" and serve a stint in America's armed forces, he or she might get an additional perk: free hunting and fishing licenses for life.\ A proposal (HB246) introduced Wednesday by Rep. George Hanosh, D- Grants, would require the New Mexico State Game and Fish Department to issue free licenses to armed-forces veterans.\ Current state law only offers free fishing and hunting licenses to military vets who are completely disabled.\ Quotes of the day:\ ""I think it's got to do with the altitude.

178," CAONCITO\ Treatment plant seen as interim solution\ Funds: Contract to build treatment plant likely to be signed soon\ Members of the Canoncito at Apache Canyon Mutual Domestic Water Consumers Association should be able to safely drink water from their home faucets sometime in the next year.\ With $140,000 earmarked during this year's legislative session for Canoncito water treatment, engineer Ramon Lucero said the association hopes to install a treatment plant to remove radium from the water supply. The Eldorado Area Water and Sanitation District and Santa Fe County had sought 10 times that amount and more in competing requests to supply clean water to Canoncito.\ Santa Fe County requested $2.2 million in capital-outlay funds from the state oil-and-gas-tax fund to build a pipeline that would rely on Eldorado water mains to carry county water through Eldorado to Canoncito. The Eldorado Area Water and Sanitation District board then countered with a request for $1.4 million to construct an Eldorado-to-Canoncito water main.\ Lucero, an engineer at Souder, Miller & Associates who consults with the water association, said a treatment plant is an adequate alternative for the near future.\ ""The line from Santa Fe would really be focused on a long-term solution for Canoncito,"" he said.\ For about a year, Canoncito residents have hauled drinking water from a tank at the KOA Santa Fe campground on the Old Las Vegas Highway. State environmental officials said the association's well- water supply does not meet recent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards for radioactive materials such as radium in drinking water.\ Lucero said the treatment plant will cost about $400,000 to complete, but the association has money available for the balance.\ ""It just takes care of their water-quality issues. They have other issues with their water,"" Lucero said.\ Those other issues include aging waterlines and insufficient water rights, Lucero said. The association last year submitted an application to transfer into association wells about 10 acre-feet of water rights currently assigned to several members' domestic wells, Lucero said. That transfer application is pending.\ Another $250,000 is available to the association to purchase water rights, Lucero said. The association owns 12 acre-feet of water rights but pumps about 22 acre-feet annually.\ The water association changed its request for a legislative capital outlay late in the process, Lucero said. While the association first sought money specifically for a main that would bring water to Canoncito from another source, it later changed the request to allow funds to be spent on general system improvements, he said.\ When the legislative session ended, another $50,000 had been appropriated to Canoncito through the Eldorado water district. Although Eldorado and Canoncito cooperated on the $1.4 million request for a pipeline after the session had started, the two water boards had not anticipated any mutual endeavor that might cost $50,000.\ ""The communication wasn't conveyed very well there. I think it was more that we had just submitted that request together,"" Lucero said.\ The $140,000 treatment-plant appropriation will go to the water association without passing through Santa Fe County or Eldorado accounts, Lucero said. To take advantage of the $50,000 outlay, he said representatives of the association would need to reach an agreement with the Eldorado Area Water and Sanitation District board of directors, maybe to use the money for mutual long-term planning, or ask to have the money reappropriated directly to the district in a future legislative session.\ Construction planning and scheduling for the treatment plant is only now beginning in earnest, Lucero said. He anticipates contracting with a Colorado firm, Water Remediation Technologies, without soliciting bids for the project. Procurement codes sometimes allow no-bid contracts when a supplier is uniquely qualified to provide a service and no competitors are available to supply a similar service.\ Lucero said the association is exploring a treatment process that uses a mineral-based medium to collect radium, which is then removed from the site without being exposed to the environment. He said the finished treatment facility would occupy a 4-by-8-foot space.\ Contact David Collins at 995-3893 or dcollins@sfnewmexican.com."
179,"
Recently, U.S. Sen. Tom Udall invited me to testify before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), the lead committee working on surface transportation authorization issues.
\
The last transportation legislation - the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) expired in September 2009.
\
Since that time, Congress has passed extensions. Meanwhile, our national transportation system is rapidly deteriorating and the recurring revenue is not keeping pace. SAFETEA-LU, like earlier transportation authorizations, is funded through the gas tax. Unfortunately, the gas tax was not indexed to inflation so it has not kept pace with escalating needs. Our surface transportation system is deteriorating and there has been no increase in the gas tax since 1993.
\
In addition, these days, people drive less and drive more fuel-efficient vehicles. Even the use of electric powered vehicles may be spreading. According to Fred Smith, CEO of Fed Ex, who also testified before the EPW committee, Fed Ex is planning to electrify its fleet. So here's a big question about the future: How can we use a gas tax to fund transportation if the streets are clogged with vehicles that do not run on gas? That's only one of the vexing problems facing Congress as they try to fashion new transportation legislation.
\
For my part, I tried to move the conversation toward the integration of land use and transportation planning. Recent projects in Baltimore, Md. and Nashville, Tenn. have shown that integrating planning in this way can reduce congestion at a lower cost than simply adding more roads. At the same time, such integrated planning can produce more reasonably priced housing along transit corridors and also support economic development in the area.
\
Other possibilities include congestion pricing (a surcharge placed on use of the transportation network during peak demand) and transportation demand management (usually associated with reducing the use of single-occupancy private vehicles). Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) is often part of the discussion and includes such possibilities as traffic signal control systems and variable message signs as well as security closed circuit television (CCTV), which is sometimes tied to homeland security issues.
\
Alongside the debate over how to fund our transportation system is the debate over what constitutes a national surface transportation system. On one side are those who believe the national transportation system is solely a system of highways. On the other side are those who understand the need for flexibility so that funding can be moved around to different transportation modes as needed. Or designed to fit into the surrounding context. In New Mexico, too often, transportation planners have torn out our Main Streets (for better traffic ""flow"") and destroyed our small towns.
\
In the middle of this debate is a huge coalition of national organizations brought together by Transportation 4 America (T4A) that is lobbying for fixing what we have first, before we add new transportation facilities (www.sierraclub.org/transportation/fixitfirst/). They also want to see Congress address pressing national priorities and hold agencies accountable for spending funds to reach those priorities.
\
Fortunately, voters already believe that repair and maintenance and public transportation are where we should focus our transportation dollars. According to a February 2011 survey, 80 percent of voters agree that federal funding to improve and modernize transportation will boost local economies and create millions of jobs. They also believe the country would benefit from an expanded and improved public transportation system (www.rockefellerfoundation.org/news/press-releases/rockefeller-foundation-infrastructure.)
\
And so we have come to a critical juncture. As Sen. Max Baucus pointed out, if we are going to compete internationally, we have to keep up. Other countries have very up-to-date infrastructure systems.
\
The U.S. once had the world's best transportation system. It's time for Congress to do what needs to be done to make our surface transportation system great once again. It's time to put aside partisan differences and work together for a transportation system that boosts economic development, provides new jobs and serves all users (whether they are on a train or in a truck, riding a bike or taking transit, walking or using a wheelchair, young or old or disabled).
\

180,"
Recently, U.S. Sen. Tom Udall invited me to testify before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), the lead committee working on surface transportation authorization issues.
\
The last transportation legislation - the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) expired in September 2009.
\
Since that time, Congress has passed extensions. Meanwhile, our national transportation system is rapidly deteriorating and the recurring revenue is not keeping pace. SAFETEA-LU, like earlier transportation authorizations, is funded through the gas tax. Unfortunately, the gas tax was not indexed to inflation so it has not kept pace with escalating needs. Our surface transportation system is deteriorating and there has been no increase in the gas tax since 1993.
\
In addition, these days, people drive less and drive more fuel-efficient vehicles. Even the use of electric powered vehicles may be spreading. According to Fred Smith, CEO of Fed Ex, who also testified before the EPW committee, Fed Ex is planning to electrify its fleet. So here's a big question about the future: How can we use a gas tax to fund transportation if the streets are clogged with vehicles that do not run on gas? That's only one of the vexing problems facing Congress as they try to fashion new transportation legislation.
\
For my part, I tried to move the conversation toward the integration of land use and transportation planning. Recent projects in Baltimore, Md. and Nashville, Tenn. have shown that integrating planning in this way can reduce congestion at a lower cost than simply adding more roads. At the same time, such integrated planning can produce more reasonably priced housing along transit corridors and also support economic development in the area.
\
Other possibilities include congestion pricing (a surcharge placed on use of the transportation network during peak demand) and transportation demand management (usually associated with reducing the use of single-occupancy private vehicles). Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) is often part of the discussion and includes such possibilities as traffic signal control systems and variable message signs as well as security closed circuit television (CCTV), which is sometimes tied to homeland security issues.
\
Alongside the debate over how to fund our transportation system is the debate over what constitutes a national surface transportation system. On one side are those who believe the national transportation system is solely a system of highways. On the other side are those who understand the need for flexibility so that funding can be moved around to different transportation modes as needed. Or designed to fit into the surrounding context. In New Mexico, too often, transportation planners have torn out our Main Streets (for better traffic ""flow"") and destroyed our small towns.
\
In the middle of this debate is a huge coalition of national organizations brought together by Transportation 4 America (T4A) that is lobbying for fixing what we have first, before we add new transportation facilities (www.sierraclub.org/transportation/fixitfirst/). They also want to see Congress address pressing national priorities and hold agencies accountable for spending funds to reach those priorities.
\
Fortunately, voters already believe that repair and maintenance and public transportation are where we should focus our transportation dollars. According to a February 2011 survey, 80 percent of voters agree that federal funding to improve and modernize transportation will boost local economies and create millions of jobs. They also believe the country would benefit from an expanded and improved public transportation system (www.rockefellerfoundation.org/news/press-releases/rockefeller-foundation-infrastructure.)
\
And so we have come to a critical juncture. As Sen. Max Baucus pointed out, if we are going to compete internationally, we have to keep up. Other countries have very up-to-date infrastructure systems.
\
The U.S. once had the world's best transportation system. It's time for Congress to do what needs to be done to make our surface transportation system great once again. It's time to put aside partisan differences and work together for a transportation system that boosts economic development, provides new jobs and serves all users (whether they are on a train or in a truck, riding a bike or taking transit, walking or using a wheelchair, young or old or disabled).

181," '96 New Mexico Elections\ The Journal today continues its series on legislative candidates seeking their party's nomination in the June 4 primary election.\ The Democrat who wins the nomination in the House District 44 race will face Republican Judy Vanderstar Russell in the Nov. 5 general election.\ DAYMON ELY\ Party affiliation: Democrat.\ Date of birth: Oct. 11, 1957.\ Education: Bachelor of arts degree and law degree, both from Arizona State University.\ Occupation: Attorney.\ Political/government experience: None.\ 1. Summarize your legislative priorities. ""My concerns are rising property taxes, education and safety in school -- especially youth violence and gangs. Also, crime, transportation, rising utility bills, health-care coverage and environmental concerns.""\ 2. What should be done at the state level about crime? ""Create a bipartisan effort to have criminals serve their entire sentences. However, having worked with abused and neglected children, I know that community-supported early intervention works, too. A legislative/ community partnership can help establish such programs.""\ 3. Would you oppose state tax increases in every instance? In what instances would you support increases in state taxes? ""I oppose raising taxes. I believe that government can be streamlined.""\ 4. Do you generally agree with the goals of Gov. Gary Johnson's administration? If not, where do you disagree? ""I cannot figure out the goals of the Gary Johnson administration. He promised to support education but vetoed additional fundings; to fight crime but vetoed stiffer sentences; and to lower taxes but vetoed the property tax relief bill.""\ 5. Summarize your position toward gambling on Indian lands and gambling elsewhere in the state (i.e. off Indian lands). ""The current compacts are not acceptable. We need to have fair negotiations with the tribes to address effective oversight and impacts on neighboring communities. Gambling off tribal lands will also require careful negotiations with local communities.""\ 6. Have you ever been charged with, or convicted of, drunken driving or any felony? ""No.""\ ROBERT A.

""Restore people's faith in government; reduce crime; improve public education; protect the environment; attract high wages in low-impact industries; repeal gross receipts tax on food and drugs; secure adequate funding for school construction and youth recreation facilities throughout the district.""\ 2. What should be done at the state level about crime? ""Violent offenders should serve at least 85 percent of their time. Nonviolent offenders should be in community correction programs with work release so they can make restitution to victims. We should require inmates to work hard or revoke all recreational and phone privileges; revoke driver's licenses of minors who drop out of school; fund public education and reform the welfare system; and allow judges to treat violent juvenile offenders as adults.""\ 3. Would you oppose state tax increases in every instance? In what instances would you support increases in state taxes? ""No. I support cigarette and liquor excise tax increases to reduce youth consumption and to fund alcohol/substance abuse facilities. I'd vote for a gas tax increase if it went to the road fund.

182,"It’s unclear how serious water and soil contamination threats from the sites of several former industrial concerns and landfills are to Santa Fe’s drinking water. And that’s a major concern for those charged with the safekeeping of area’s water supply.\“What the threat is we don’t know, and that’s a little disconcerting to us,” Bill Schneider, water resources coordinator with Santa Fe’s Public Utilities Department, said in a recent interview. “We would like to get a better handle on what’s out there as far as contamination.”\Schneider, city environmental compliance specialist Alex Puglisi and staff are involved in an ongoing effort to look at four sites being investigated for contamination levels. Puglisi gave a brief update on the situation to the city Public Utilities Committee earlier this month.\As part of developing Source Water Protection Plans (SWPPP) that the city is formulating with the New Mexico Environment Department’s Drinking Water Bureau for the city’s water sources, Puglisi and Schneider said that a wellhead protection plan addressing known groundwater contamination and other potential sources of contamination will also be a major component of the SWPPP. The report is expected around the end of March.\It’s “a systematic evaluation of risk and uncertainty with respect to some of these sites … and how it may pertain to water quality,” said Schneider.\The wellhead protection plan will “look at where our water supply wells are relative to these sites and what risk may be derived from how we operate our wells,” according to Schneider.\The sites in question include a dry cleaner, a PNM Generating Station and two landfills – one a city-operated landfill and the other an informal dump – all of which are no longer in use.\The generating station, used to generate electricity until about the 1990s, has been under investigation for several decades, according to Puglisi.\It’s located near Baca Street and Cerrillos Road, close to the Railyard where Santa Fe Well No. 1, known as the Baca Street well, is also located.\“We the city actually put that site back on the radar in about 2013-14 when we asked (the New Mexico Environment Department) to go out and do wholesale sampling of the site,” said Puglisi.\In the 1980s and ’90s, that well was determined to be contaminated with several petroleum-related chemicals, including benzene, a known carcinogen. But a small plant treated the water before it was distributed to the public until the city shut it down in 2012 for several reasons, including the need for more sampling, said Puglisi.\A spill several decades ago from an above-ground bulk fuel storage tank on the generating station site is the suspected source of the contamination, but the site also had underground fuel storage tanks, Puglisi said.\“We wondered if the plume was moving in a different direction, but we also saw some increases in nitrate in our well, but not above (federal) standard,” said Puglisi.\The groundwater was treated to negate the petroleum chemicals present, but then increases in nitrate were detected, he said.\Nitrate can occur naturally in surface and groundwater, but high levels can be dangerous, particularly to infants and pregnant women, according to the Centers for Disease Control.\Concurrent investigations are ongoing by two state agencies: the environment department’s Ground Water Quality Bureau and the Petroleum Storage Tank Bureau, which uses gas tax revenues from a corrective action fund for cleanups. Water quality monitoring wells were drilled there in 2017 and a water bureau abatement plan report was expected to have been completed last week.\An environmental contractor submitted a groundwater monitoring report to the Storage Tank Bureau in January. The city has asked to submit comments and meet with that agency before the bureau accepts the report, states a city environment update from last week.\The city agreed with the contractor’s work plan request for two more quarters of groundwater monitoring, but that plan is yet to be approved by the bureau, said the environment update.\A spokeswoman with the environment department said state and city officials will meet to discuss the findings of the report and next steps. She said the work plan for future groundwater monitoring is under review.\A final abatement report from the contractor and PNM was expected to have been submitted to the state environment department’s Ground Water Quality Bureau earlier this month, according to the city’s environment update.\The agencies are trying to determine “the nature and extent of the contamination … and how far it’s gone,” said Puglisi.\Dry cleaner site monitored\Another site of city concern is the location of a former dry cleaners at what’s now the South College Plaza at Cerrillos Road and St. Michael’s Drive. The shopping center owners entered into a voluntary cleanup agreement several years ago with the state groundwater bureau to investigate and clean up a vapor plume of Perchloroethylene (PCE) from dry cleaning fluids, said Puglisi.\Long-term exposure to PCE, which is also found in household cleaners, adhesives, paint and shoe polish, can cause cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health.\“The immediate concern about that is in soil that can cause vapor intrusion into buildings,” said Puglisi.\The shopping center’s contractor has installed a system to remove and treat soil vapors and the city has asked for further investigation “because they did find contamination in shallow groundwater (monitoring wells),” Puglisi said.\“We have some questions about the further extent of groundwater contamination; how far it’s gone and how deep it’s gone, how far horizontally and how deep vertically,” he said. “We want to know what the full extent of contamination is and whether or not it could be a threat to one of our wells because we have a well right there on St. Michael’s near the railroad tracks.”\“We somewhat disagree with the direction of groundwater flow that they (the contractor) are showing at the site because he is showing north and east, and groundwater tends to flow west and southwest,” said Puglisi.\A meeting is scheduled with the state environment department to compare notes.\If it’s determined the contamination has traveled further afield, the city would nix plans to drill another production well near Governor Miles Park that would replace the Baca Street Well No. 1, said Puglisi. Vapor intrusion is no longer believed to be a threat to the area buildings, he said.\Old dumps also scrutinized\Another contamination site in the city’s sights is an old dump covering about 35 acres, which is now a place for Fido and Rover to roam freely at the Frank S. Ortiz Dog Park at El Camino de las Cruces and Buckman Road.\The city has added three groundwater monitoring wells for a total of four, and installed soil vapor probes to check contamination levels of nitrates and “low concentrations of volatile organic compounds” detected there, said Puglisi. Nitrates are common in landfills, he said.\A two-year period of quarterly monitoring started this week and will conclude with a report of what was found and how to abate it.\The city is considering installing a waterline for a dog watering station at the park after a request by the Parks and Recreation Division and Friends of the Dog Park, according to a city environmental update.\Another contamination site being looked at is the 110-acre Paseo de Vista Landfill between Buckman Road and Paseo de Vista, closed since about the 1990s, where methane gas releases and groundwater are currently being monitored."
183,"Business leaders from the Carlsbad area spent two days in Santa Fe this week to meet with cabinet secretaries appointed by newly-elected Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and discuss issues specific to Eddy County and the State's role in meeting the region's needs.\The Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce's Bat Brigade met with New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) Cabinet Secretary James Kenney, Cabinet Secretary for the New Mexico Department of Transportation (NMDOT) Michael Sandoval and Cabinet Secretary of the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD) Sarah Cottrell Propst.\All three secretaries discussed the goals and challenges of their departments, especially during a time of significant growth in the oil and gas industry throughout southeast New Mexico.\Here are the promises state officials made to Carlsbad's business leaders during the trip.\State permits for oil and gas operations are issued by the Oil Conservation Division (OCD) – an arm of EMNRD, and Propst vowed to properly staff the Division to adequately address the growth and to hold operators accountable to state law.\Propst said the oil and gas sector itself is drawing staff with an awareness of the industry away from government jobs.\She said the Department plans to request additional funding in its budget requests to fund more positions at the OCD and EMRND.\EMNRD is asking lawmakers to fund a compliance officer in Hobbs, technicians in Artesia and Hobbs, along with other environmental attorneys and specialists in the region, Propst said.\""A pretty flat budget was submitted by the last administration,"" she said. ""One of the gaps was at the OCD. The number of permits submitted are only increasing. We need more staff. We think it will help us do a better job on the enforcement side, and the application process.""\The Carlsbad Brine Well remediation project is a key priority of EMNRD, Propst said, and she promised to hold the State-hired contractor The Wood Group accountable for staying on budget and on schedule.\Propst and Kenney sit on the Carlsbad Brine Well Remediation Authority, per state law, and Propst said she plans to hold a meeting in the coming months to get new authority members up to speed on the work expected to begin in February.\""Now that we have new cabinet members who sit on the authority, we need to have a meeting with the authority,"" she said. ""It'll be good to do that and get a meeting going. We also have a responsibility to keep track of the contractor.""\At the start of his meeting with Bat Brigade members, Kenney was asked if oil and gas regulations would change.\His answer was simple: yes.\Kenney said his department intended to make decisions based on science and will prioritize environmental protections amid growth in oil and gas operations in southeast New Mexico.\He said he planned to bring all of those impacted to the negotiating table when devising policy, including oil and gas executives and local government leaders.\And aside from acquiring a license to operate from NMED, Kenney said companies must also pursue a ""social license"" by supporting local communities through charity work and other avenues of public outreach.\""The social license to operate in communities is of even greater value,"" Kenney said. ""That license is gained by being good neighbors and giving back to the community.""\He also promised to work closely with the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, a federal nuclear waste repository near Carlsbad – to ensure that operations run smoothly and transparently.\WIPP holds a license to store waste from the NMED, and Kenney said any alterations to that permit – such as a move to change how waste volumes are tracked that was approved by former NMED Secretary Butch Tongate in the final months of the previous administration – could evade controversy if all regulatory agencies and stakeholders are included in the discussion from the beginning.\""Strategic planning for the WIPP is something that would benefit them and us. Those items happen to be high controversy. They're areas that require a lot of planning, and stakeholder interaction,"" Kenney said.\""We process permits and are protecting the environment as we do so. We want to make sure that as we're thinking about what's going to happen in the next year or so, we need milestones for that community involvement.""\The top priority in the NMDOT's second district – which contains Eddy, Lea, Chaves and part of Otero counties – is a 22-mile rebuild of U.S. Highway 285 from the Texas State Line to the Village of Loving, Sandoval said.\He said the NMDOT has only $20 million in funds identified for a project expected to cost up to $70 million.\U.S. 285 is a main thoroughfare between Carlsbad and the oilfields in southern Eddy County and West Texas.\With the ongoing oil boom, traffic on 285 became snarled, and numerous fatal accidents were reported in the last year.\""(U.S.) 285 is one of the most deadly highways in New Mexico, definitely one of the busiest,"" said District 2 Engineer Timothy Parker during a meeting with the Bat Brigade. ""Focusing and having everybody together on the same page will really help those projects.""\Sandoval also promised to encourage public-private partnerships to fund road projects, seeking assistance from the oil and gas industry – the biggest user of 285.\The cabinet secretary also said he supports a proposed 10-percent increase on the State Gas Tax, a move that could additional funds to the State Road Fund, which provides the budget for the NMDOT.\""Part of this reoccurring revenue, we want to make available to private public partnerships,"" he said. ""There is some good money that can be put toward infrastructure. We need to find ways to make this possible.""\Phillip McGlasson, business supervisor at Anadarko Petroleum and Bat Brigade member said his workers are more afraid of driving to work than a work place accident.\""Every meeting we have, we have a safety moment. It's always about driving,"" he said. ""Nothing that happens on a drilling rig compares to the danger of driving to and from work.

184," WASHINGTON -- The name of the game now is moderation.\ After slamming headlong into Democratic name-calling labeling them ""extremist,"" Senate Republicans led by Budget Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., tacked sharply toward the political center last week. They still set a heading for a balanced budget six years from now but dumped some controversial and expensive conservative promises to slash taxes and threw overboard deep cuts in social spending.\ ""I can defend this budget,"" said Domenici after the committee approved his plan 13-11 on Thursday. ""I can take it home. I can defend it anywhere. It's a giant step and it takes it in my opinion without any gimmicks and it's very fair.""\ Domenici sought to pare assaults on education, environment and health spending to help Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole's lagging presidential campaign.\ ""Sen. Dole wants this budget,"" Domenici said, arguing that Democrats won't be able to truthfully assail cuts in benefits for the elderly because ""we've eliminated some of the areas where the politics cause misunderstandings.""\ Compared to last year's GOP budgets, the new Senate plan makes fewer ambitious cuts in federal spending:\ * It calls for $567 billion in savings between now and 2002, $42 billion more than President Clinton's 1997 budget. That's far less than the $1 trillion Republicans had hoped to trim last year. In part, that's due to a sudden narrowing of the deficit in recent months, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\ * It makes far smaller cuts in the growth of Medicare than the GOP had suggested last year. This year's plan allows Medicare to increase at an annual rate of 6.1 percent each year, from $196 billion in spending this year to $280 billion in 2002. The plan also calls for unspecified steps to make the Medicare hospital fund solvent over the next 10 years. Democrats argue the Domenici plan is too fuzzy on this count and could hurt rural and poor urban hospitals.\ * The new GOP plan makes room for $122 billion in tax cuts, about a third of what Republicans wanted under the 1994 ''Contract With America.'' Domenici didn't want big tax cuts last year, and, this year, he pushed them aside. His plan does allow for a $500-a-child tax credit for couples with incomes under $110,000. Any additional tax cuts the GOP wants -- such as Dole's call to repeal part of the federal gas tax -- would have to be paid for, not by spending cuts, but by closing corporate tax loopholes.\ * The only nudge upward in spending is for defense: Pentagon spending would rise from $265.6 billion in 1997 to $276.9 billion in 2002.\ But even that, according to analysts, is enough for Republicans to stake out a campaign issue, with spending on controversial items such as a new ballistic missile defense.\ ""That gives you bragging rights to say you want to increase defense spending,"" says Stan Collender, budget analyst for Price Waterhouse, ""But does it do much over the long term for defense? No.""\ Overall, says Collender, the new GOP budget marks a new level of unity for Republicans, now led by moderates such as Domenici and Dole in budget issues. After fractious closed-door talks, the House and Senate are largely on the same song sheet. Only a few differences remain: House Budget Committee Republicans want to close the Energy Department, and their Senate counterparts, led by Domenici, don't.\ Much of the GOP budget plan has Domenici's stamp on it. It will be enacted over three parts this year, allowing Dole to organize a thematic campaign from the Senate floor and deferring fights over additional tax cuts until later this summer.\ But more importantly, Collender says, the Republicans are trying to pull back a little from last year, inoculating themselves against charges they were doing too much, too fast.\ ""They've moderated things a bit,"" says Collender. ""We're really not that much further along than we were in January"" during budget negotiations between Capitol Hill and the White House.\ Both the Senate GOP plan and the White House are relatively close in the overall savings they seek between now and 2002 -- just $42 billion apart. But big policy differences remain. And while the White House sounded a conciliatory tone on the Domenici plan last week, House Democrats attacked it immediately for trying to make any savings in Medicare for the elderly.\ Senate Democrats had their criticisms, too, complaining about GOP savings in domestic spending and limits on Medicare growth. The Domenici plan, according to Democrats and independent analysts, is short on details, allowing Republicans plenty of wiggle room.\ The plan, for example, calls for $53 billion in welfare cuts and claims to be based on a plan by governors earlier this year. However, that's about $9 billion more than the governor's plan was to have saved, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, an advocacy group for the poor.\ The Domenici plan would reduce the Earned Income Tax Credit, aimed at reducing the taxes of the working poor, by $17 billion, leading 6 million working households to suffer tax increases, according to the center.\ And Democrats say they fear the plan may be a stalking horse for bigger, more ambitious, tax cuts down the road.\ Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., the ranking Democrat on the Senate budget panel lauded Domenici's plan as better than last year's but suggested the difference was ""choosing between a polecat and a skunk.""\ But Domenici differed: ""This is very different than the last time.""\ Cuts in discretionary spending -- programs other than entitlements -- are smaller than last year, he noted. And while both the 1997 White House and the Senate plans rely on big cuts at the end of the six-year period, Domenici's plan makes more up-front cuts in discretionary spending.\ As a result, Domenici hopes not only to steer again toward a balanced budget but, incorporating less controversy in his plan, give Republicans a stronger election-year position.\ ""I think the president wants to negotiate a balanced budget,"" he said. ""He won't be able to paint us like he did before. We will hold our own on this budget."""
185,"Cost of removal, \who will pay for it remain unknown\By Phaedra Haywood\The New Mexican\Study of the hydrocarbon pollution under the land where a new district courthouse is slated for construction has revealed the contamination ""is not as bad as originally thought,"" according to County Attorney Stephen Ross.\Ross said county consultants and New Mexico Environment Department staff have succeeded in defining the pollution plume that is thought to have come from a number of leaking gasoline tanks that had been near the downtown site beginning in the 1920s.\Ross said the plume is about 600 feet long by 150 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. He said it appears to be a fairly stable trench that contains about 29,000 gallons.\Ross said the contaminants will be cleaned up by digging out all the soil in that area and sucking the polluted water from atop the water table. \Environment Department spokeswoman Marissa Bardino said Santa Fe County hasn't submitted its work plan for approval yet.\But Ross said preliminary discussions call for the county to pump water out of its test wells on the site -- which is at the corner of Montezuma Avenue and Sandoval Street -- and for the Environment Department to pump water out of monitoring wells at other nearby sites thought to have contributed to the plume.\How much the removal will cost, and who will pay for it, are still unknowns, Ross said.\The Environment Department has spent about $300,000 monitoring several known pollution sites adjacent to the planned courthouse over the last two decades, but little remediation has occurred.\Those sites were lower on the state's priority list, according to NMED Petroleum Storage Tank Bureau Chief Jim Davis, because there were no immediate health risks from any of the locations. ""Now that the county has started construction,"" he wrote in an e-mail, ""conditions at the site have changed and we are working with the county on the best approach for cleanup.""\The money to monitor the sites has come from the Corrective Action Fund, which is fed by the gas tax. But Environment Department officials have said they aren't sure yet if the fund can be used to remedy problems at the courthouse site.\When construction on the $38 million project was halted in May, county officials estimated they would have to pay contractors about $40,000 per month to sit idle while plans were being made to clean up the site. But county spokesman Stephen Ulibarri said Tuesday that number has been renegotiated to about $15,000 per month.\Ulibarri said the county has spent about $4.2 million on the project so far, and owes contractor Bradbury Stamm another $886,000 -- about $30,000 of which is related to putting the project on hold.\County Manager Roman Abeyta said he is optimistic that once the cleanup is done, the county can move ahead with the original design for the building, which includes two stories of underground parking. Abeyta said he's reluctant to promise anything until a work plan is approved by the New Mexico Environment Department and more is known about costs.\Abeyta said he expects to have a plan for the County Commission's consideration in early September.\Contact Phaedra Haywood \at 986-3068 or phaywood@sfnewmexican.com."

As someone who has worked in the economic development arena at the state and local level the last 20 years in New Mexico and for several years in Texas before that, I thought I needed to respond to Alan Webber's recent op-ed, ""Reimagining New Mexico's economic future.""
\
The real truth is, Webber supports radical policies -- like a government-mandated minimum gas price of $4.50 per gallon. I don't know Alan Webber. Never met him. However, for someone seeking to be our governor, his fringe ideas and view of the world should give us all pause for concern, regardless of political affiliation, because they would make life harder and more difficult for New Mexico's families and businesses.
\
Specifically, let's examine his views on gas pricing. You wouldn't have guessed it by reading his recent column -- which stuck to generalities and platitudes -- but as recently as 2012, Webber called for higher gas prices and once crafted a radical plan to try and eliminate car use by raising taxes on all drivers.
\
In a 1971 memo, Webber called on the city of Portland to take dramatic measures to discourage people from driving and, in effect, clear the roads through ""attrition."" One way to do it, he wrote, is to penalize all drivers through ""increases in gas tax and vehicle license fees.""
\
Apparently, the way he sees it, the more you burden people with higher taxes, the less likely they'll want to drive. But it appears Webber believed that raising taxes didn't go far enough. He also wanted to make it unlawful to have less than three people in a car during certain curfew hours. ... You can't make this stuff up!
\
Further, he encouraged in his memo, ""Make it a violation of city code, punishable by police ticket, to enter the city from 7:30-9:00 a.m. with less than three persons in any standard size automobile.""
\
In New Mexico, a vast geographic state with a relatively small population, we rely on our vehicles every day -- to commute to work, to get to our ranches and farms, to pick up our children from school and to shop at grocery stores. We still have a very rural way of life -- mostly by choice. To think that Webber may want to make it a crime to drive around our towns and communities without several passengers is over the top.
\
As though these extreme measures weren't enough, he also called for a halt to all road construction in the city of Portland, advocated for more tollbooths and believed there should be a cap on the number of parking lots. Now those are all really attractive ideas if you're a CEO looking to move a business to a state!
\
And if there were ever any question whether Webber still believes in these out-of-the-mainstream ideas, he wrote a column for USA Today in 2012 where he called for higher gas prices. That's right, he wanted people to pay more at the pump during a year that saw the highest average gas prices.
\
In the op-ed aptly titled ""High gas prices? Bring 'em on!"" Webber wrote passionately that he believed gas prices should continue to rise -- if only to discourage people from driving their cars. He wrote that, ""... unlike Obama or his Republican challengers, I want higher gas prices."" Now if you were CEO of a company looking to expand or relocate to New Mexico, would this type of thinking by the governor get you excited?
\
I feel I can speak for most of us when I say that no one wants to pay more at the pump. Higher gas prices make life harder for our families and our businesses, yet it appears Webber didn't think they were high enough! By the way, isn't the oil and gas industry in our state one of the larger contributors to tax revenues and jobs and a large revenue source for public education? ... I thought so.
\
These are just a few of the radical ideas that Webber champions. But you wouldn't have guessed it by reading his recent column.
\
Contrary to Webber's views, Governor Martinez and the majority of us in the private sector believe we need lower taxes and fewer government regulations so that business can thrive here in our state. Many of my colleagues in the private sector, including myself, have encouraged and supported the governor's efforts to embrace policies of lower taxes and less regulation, not only for providing the proper business environment for our businesses to flourish, but also to recruit new industry into the state that would provide higher paying jobs with benefits and improve our citizen's financial quality of life.
\
This is a promise she made as a candidate, and a promise I believe she is working hard to keep as our chief executive.
\
For example, just last year Governor Martinez and the Legislature passed a bi-partisan jobs package that was hailed by one Democrat leader in the Legislature as ""the closest thing we've had since I have been here to true, total tax reform."" The legislation reduced the tax on businesses from 7.6 to 5.9 percent -- a substantial decrease that levels the playing field with our neighboring states, and allows us to be more competitive in recruiting business and industry to our state.
\
Already, many of the governor's key economic policies, which I encouraged and supported, have taken effect. After working to amend the state's tax code to protect manufacturers from being penalized for exporting goods, New Mexico went from 38th in the nation to first in export growth.
\
That's great news for employees and employers in our state. As is recent news that the Council on State Taxation (COST), a nonpartisan group, upgraded New Mexico's rating to a B from its previous D due to the reforms undertaken by the governor, which among other things simplify the tax code. Business and industry from outside the state take notice of these type of things as they explore options for which states to expand and relocate to.
\
So as we assess our governor and her challengers this election year, let's be mindful of their respective positions. Do you want a governor who believes we need higher taxes, higher gas prices, more bureaucracy and more strain on our family finances?
\
I, for one, support someone like Governor Martinez who embraces lower taxes, less red tape, encourages job growth, innovation and has a record of success to show for it.
\
While Webber has a right to his views and perspective, New Mexicans also have the right to know what they really are!

Las Cruces recently received a Bronze level Bicycle Friendly Community award from the League of American Bicyclists in recognition of its efforts to improve road conditions, encourage bike riding for recreation, health and the environment, and promote safety through bike riding skills courses and more. The city is to be commended for the work accomplished to achieve this prominent national recognition. In spite of this recognition I continue to hear comments against cyclists.
\
Regardless of whether you're a cyclist or not, we can all find common ground in improving the safety and usefulness of our roads, avoid conflicts, crashes, injury and death. We can all agree that cyclists and all users of the public roadways must comply with all applicable traffic laws in the interest of accomplishing those goals. However, there are those who continue to believe that cyclists do not belong on the roads, don't pay their fair share, and should be regulated via licensing and fees. I would like to address these concerns with the hope that we as a community can work towards a mutual understanding.
\
Under both state and federal law, bicycles are considered vehicles and have every right to be on the roads, except where explicitly prohibited. By state law, bicycles are given the same rights and responsibilities as any other vehicle (see sections 66-3-707 to 66-3-707 NMSA 1978). Cyclists are prohibited on certain sections of New Mexico's interstates under that same legal code, but even then cyclists are only prohibited where a suitable alternate route exists, such as where interstates pass through towns where local streets are an option. Many highways and interstates are in fact part of state and national bike routes. Federal transportation funding for cities also requires local municipalities to account for all users of a roadway to qualify for public funds. These users include vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. When cyclists ride on the roads following traffic laws and riding predictably and visibly, they are seen by motorists thus improving their safety.
\
The fees a bicyclist pays are the same as those paid by motorists. We all pay property taxes, sales tax, income taxes and often fuel taxes since most cyclists also own and drive cars. Just paying the fuel tax in no way implies sole rights to the use of roads. All roads are paid for by taxes, tolls, or development fees and the source of the funding is dependent on the road type. In most cities, new roads are paid for by developers and those costs are then transferred to the purchasers of the homes. The federal fuel tax is 18.90 cents per gallon in New Mexico and coupled with the state's share, the total fuel tax to 37.2 cents/gallon, is well below the US average of 49.5 cents/gallon. The funds from these taxes are not all for road maintenance and only a portion of the state funds from the gas tax (5.76 percent) goes to road funds for municipalities. In terms of damage from wear and tear, bicyclists have a much smaller impact on roads and require very little in terms of maintenance when using in-road facilities. In addition, more people on bikes equal less traffic and congestion for those driving cars.
\
When the city implements a ""road diet"" as they did on Solano (lane reduction, bike lane striping) the primary beneficiary is the motorists. The number of motor vehicle crashes go down on these roads, traffic continues to flow smoothly without ""stop and go"" behavior and lane changing to pick the faster lane. The pedestrians benefit because they are further separated from the motor vehicles. And lastly, the cyclists benefit due to the bike lane. So contrary to what many believe, the city is not doing this to ""cater"" to cyclists. They are improving the road conditions for all users. In regard to Solano, the city is to be commended for saving money by restriping at the same time they had scheduled regular maintenance rather than later.
\
Some believe that bikes should have special insurance or licenses. Insurance for vehicles and licenses for drivers arises from the potential for causing harm. Bicycles simply do not have the same potential for causing harm, which is a main reason for licensed drivers. For thousands of years, everyone was free to use the road with the only restraint that they follow the rules of the road. It was not until the early 1900s when it was suggested vehicles be required to be licensed. The potential death and destruction caused by vehicles was the driving force in the licensing requirement. Today the requirement that motorized vehicles have licenses highlights the fact they have a regulated right to the road because their use of the roads is by permission of the state and subject to revocation. Bicycles and other non-motorized users are given the right to use the road as long as they observe the rules of the road.
\
The tragic death of Dr. Ron Fronczek who was hit and killed while riding up the San Augustine Pass earlier this year points out that all motorists have a responsibility to slow down behind cyclists until it is safe to pass. Yielding to slower moving traffic and passing safely is the law and should be enforced vigorously by law enforcement. The cycling community is a close one and mourns the loss of life and what it means to the families of the deceased as well as the loss to our community as a whole, whether we knew the rider personally or not. Remember that the cyclist you see riding on the road is someone's mother, father, child, spouse, grandparent, child's teacher, dentist, doctor, elected official, college professor, your neighbor, etc. Cyclists contribute to the fabric of the community economically, socially and culturally just as everyone else. We just happen to love driving our bikes, either by necessity or choice, and want motorists to drive respectfully, not because we ask you to but because it's the law - to pass safely, to not follow too closely and to be attentive.

188,"N.M. will pay for liquid gas removal; county will take care of contaminated soil \By Phaedra Haywood\The New Mexican\Gov. Bill Richardson's office announced Thursday that he has directed the New Mexico Environment Department to take the lead on cleaning up the petroleum-contaminated site in downtown Santa Fe where a new District Courthouse is destined to be built. \In addition to overseeing the cleanup, the Environment Department will use the Corrective Action Fund, which is fed by a statewide gas tax, to pay for much of the process, said Jim Norton, director of the department's Environmental Protection Division. \Norton said Santa Fe County will still be required to clean up contaminated soil on the lot -- which is at the corner of Sandoval Street and Montezuma Avenue -- but that the fund would be used to address liquid gas removal and the offsite sources of the pollution. \Norton said exact costs are still unknown, but the county's portion should cost somewhere in the $1 million range. The state's portion will likely come to ""several million."" \Construction on the $38 million courthouse was put on hold in May after test wells began to fill with floating gasoline, which is thought to have come from leaking tanks of gas stations located in the area over the past 50 years or so. \State and county officials have spent most of the summer trying to determine the source and extent of the contamination.\Norton said the contaminating plume is a fairly large one, created by the commingling of several different sources. It extends all the way across the courthouse site to north of the current district attorney's building, which is very near the Santa Fe River. \Richardson's office issued a statement Thursday saying the plume's proximity to the river was one of the motivating factors in ordering the state agency to take over the cleanup. \Norton said the Environment Department has no reason to believe that the contamination has reached the river, but said no tests have been performed in the river to date.\According to Richardson's statement, the Environment Department has begun working on a ""petroleum contamination remediation system"" that will be designed to clean up potentially thousands of gallons of petroleum contained in the soils on the courthouse site, and to protect the site from further contamination. The system is expected to operate for at least two to three years, according to the statement. \But Norton said the operation of the system will not keep the project from resuming sooner than that. \County spokesman Stephen Ulibarri said in an e-mail Thursday that the County hopes to begin work on the site as early as November. \County manager Roman Abeyta said Thursday that the state's new role should put an end to speculation that the courthouse project might have to be moved. ""You never say never, but it's a slim-to-none chance that we would move it now,"" Abeyta said.\Contact Phaedra Haywood at 986-3068 or phaywood@sfnewmexican.com."
189,"Arnold Schwarzenegger was the one waxing environmental Monday in the wake of President Barack Obama's support of his state's bid to set its own rules for greenhouse-gas emissions from cars and trucks. But the California governor wasn't alone in his war with the Bush Environmental Protection Agency: New Mexico's Gov. Bill Richardson, along with our environment secretary, Ron Curry, and Attorney General Gary King were leading allies -- so there's plenty of rejoicing in our state offices.\The new president ordered the EPA to pay immediate attention to California's longstanding application to set higher fuel-efficiency and carbon-emissions standards for vehicles sold in that state -- and, by implication, New Mexico and the dozen others that had sued EPA to grant what should have been a routine waiver from federally set levels. \This doesn't mean Detroit and overseas automakers have to start turning out cleaner cars overnight; there's a two-year lag time that our legislature might extend. New Mexico's environment department, when it adopted the standards, gave manufacturers and dealers until 2011 to comply. Curry, for his efforts, got slapped with a federal lawsuit from makers and sellers -- and a state lawsuit from conservative legislators.\Those suits still must be resolved -- but the president's orders should render such actions moot. So should the efforts some carmakers, mostly Asian, have made in anticipation that kid-gloves treatment from the White House wouldn't last forever.\For good measure, the president ordered the Transportation Department to set firm fuel-efficiency standards called for in the 2007 energy bill advanced by New Mexico Sens. Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici. Those standards would, 11 years from now, raise Corporate Average Fuel Economy levels from today's \27 miles per gallon to 35 mpg. Meanwhile, Congress should consider a buck-a-gallon boost in gas tax as a fuel-efficiency incentive. \For all their bellyaching about not being able to sell cars as it is, so leave us alone, we're guessing that the president's nudge is what automakers need to build cars people will buy. They're getting steadily better at electric cars capable of fast acceleration, highway speeds of macho appeal, and -- most important, plenty of miles between plug-ins.\There's no doubting Detroit's ability to adapt: Once it's dragged, kicking and screaming, into new eras, its engineers, designers and assembly people perform what they'd like us to believe are miracles. Just one look at today's car lots shows us not the 300-horsepower heavyweight V8s of yesteryear, but fuel-efficient V6s, loaded to the gunwales with breathtaking electronics and with 300 horses and more in their lightweight, tight-steering packages. And for more sensible folks, there are subcompacts and hybrids. \This is not the same American automobile establishment that, in the 1960s and '70s, said fuel-efficient cars are impossible -- only to watch former customers drive by in Honda Civics. They've learned.\That doesn't mean they're still not resisting governmental pressure -- state and federal -- for cleaner, cheaper-to-run cars, for reasons best known to their executives who weren't bashful about demanding federal handouts in recent months. But those industry leaders had better hear the president's words as the warning they are -- or prepare to hear electric Hondas humming past their dealers' lots."
190,"Efforts in New Mexico to curtail lucrative oil and gas exploration projects threaten to seriously damage our state's education system at a time when COVID-19 is hurting energy production and forcing educational budget cutbacks. We cannot afford to fall further behind in educating our students.\Many residents may forget that the state's budget, especially for education, depends on the 11.5 percent tax on oil and natural gas output. Those tax revenues contributed roughly $1.1 billion to local school districts in 2019 - equaling about $2,500 for each of our 340,000 public school students. It contributed over $300 million to higher education, enabling Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to propose free public colleges for over 55,000 students.\As a retired college professor with a lifelong appreciation of how a strong education benefits students, I worry about our children's and grandchildren's ability to obtain the superior public school training required to compete in the increasingly competitive talent war nationally and globally.\This is especially troublesome in New Mexico, which is one of the poorest states and where three in four of our public school students are minorities.\There's cause for concern. In 2019, our state's fourth grade and eighth grade students' test scores in math and reading on the Nation's Report Card fell well below the national average. Only 29 percent of our fourth graders were proficient in math and just 24 percent in reading while nationwide, over 40 percent are proficient in math and one-third were proficient in reading. Among our eighth graders, 21 percent were proficient in math and 23 percent in reading versus about a third of students nationally proficient in each of the two subjects.\Our efforts to improve the educational achievements of our students depend heavily on the continued flow of substantial tax revenues from the oil and gas industry. But that revenue windfall is threatened by the efforts by environmental activists to ban oil and gas leasing on federal lands and to prohibit new oil and gas exploration or infrastructure projects as well as proposed improvement projects on existing facilities.\Nearly half of New Mexico's oil and gas production occurs on federal land, and some estimates are that the state would lose 62,000 jobs and more than $1 billion in federal revenue by 2021 if such leasing was prohibited. These high-paying jobs are essential to our state, and I especially fear we will lose our ""golden goose"" as those jobs migrate to other states.\A cleaner energy future is an essential objective, but we must do it responsibly while meeting our energy needs and economic growth plans. Until then, though, we can't abandon traditional fuels overnight. Objectively, we require a transition of several decades while renewable energy and technological advances deliver steady pollution-controlling gains. Also, it isn't that the U.S. is failing to lead in improving the environment. We've registered the largest absolute decrease in carbon dioxide emissions of any country since 2000, reports the International Energy Agency. And natural gas ranks among the cleanest fuels.\New Mexicans cannot lose sight of how much oil and gas tax revenues contribute to our state. They improve our country roads and highways. They support law enforcement. They help build community parks and services. But it's their outsized impact on our schools that, frankly, is most important. Every student who attends a public school or college in our state benefits from oil and gas tax revenues. We must never forget that.\Herbert L. Trujillo is resident of Española, lifelong New Mexican and retired educator from Northern New Mexico College.\CREDIT: Herbert L. Trujillo"
191,"AZTEC – As climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic remain a focal point for New Mexico lawmakers, several bills relating to the utility industries aim to address those topics.\Some of these bills build on the past efforts such as the Energy Transition Act. Others promote carbon capture or seek to protect ratepayers from potential rate increases lawmakers say could come as utilities adopt more aggressive renewable portfolio standards.\Still other bills seek to address the impacts that COVID-19 has had on utility customers as well as the utilities.\Here is a look at some of the bills that were introduced this week.\Montoya signs on to bill promoting use of carbon dioxide from carbon capture\As Farmington and Enchant Energy are working to acquire the San Juan Generating Station and retrofit it with carbon capture technology, a group of Republican state lawmakers have introduced a bill that would encourage the use of the carbon dioxide captured from the plant.\Rep. Larry Scott, R-Hobbs, Rep. James Townsend, R-Artesia, Rep. Randall Pettigrew, R-Lovington, and Rep. Rod Montoya, R-Farmington, have sponsored House Bill 181, known as Oil and Gas Tax Changes.\This bill would promote the use of captured carbon dioxide in enhanced oil recovery by temporarily exempting it from the severance tax on carbon dioxide. This would apply to carbon dioxide captured from the San Juan Generating Station as well as direct air carbon capture. Occidental Petroleum, or Oxy, is working to develop a direct air carbon capture facility in the Permian Basin in west Texas. This would be the largest direct air capture facility in the world. Both projects intend to sell the captured carbon dioxide for use in enhanced oil recovery.\House Bill 181 was introduced on Jan. 25 and has been referred to the House Energy, Environment and Natural Resources Committee.\If passed, carbon dioxide from carbon capture facilities would not be subject to severance taxes until 2030.\Duckett urges attention to\the Clean Electrification Act\The Clean Electrification Act, introduced by Rep. Nathan Small, D-Las Cruces, on Jan. 25, has caught the attention of Farmington Mayor Nate Duckett.\During the Jan. 26 City Council meeting, Duckett urged the city councilors to read over the bill.\While previous legislation, including the Energy Transition Act, had only applied the renewable portfolio standards requiring zero-emissions power by 2045 to utilities regulated by the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission, House Bill 137 includes municipal utilities such as Farmington Electric Utility System and Aztec Electric Utility in those requirements.\""I think we need to pay attention to that,"" Duckett said.\Farmington currently receives electricity from coal, natural gas and hydropower while Aztec receives electricity from solar, wind, hydropower and other energy purchased on the market through its contract with Guzman Energy.\However, the bill does more than just address municipal utilities.\A press release from Western Resource Advocates and the Natural Resources Defense Council states it will ""bolster and diversify New Mexico's economy, capitalize on New Mexico's abundance of carbon-free energy, provide a robust New Mexico response to the threat of climate change, and help bring electricity service to low income and indigenous households that now lack lights and power.""\One of the tools that it creates to reduce emissions is a Clean Electricity Credit that can be sold or transferred. It also provides incentives for electric utilities to provide service to people within their service are who do not have access to electricity, especially in Native American and low-income communities.\""The Clean Electrification Act means New Mexicans will enjoy the benefits of our changing energy landscape,"" Small said in the press release. ""We build on the foundation laid by the Energy Transition Act with a two-pronged approach of electrifying homes, businesses, and industry, while at the same time ensuring the electricity serving those new loads remains clean and emission-free.""\The bill has been referred to the House Energy, Environment and Natural Resources Committee.\Montoya, Lane and Strickler among sponsors of bill focused on renewable energy standards\On the other side of the aisle, three San Juan County legislators are among the sponsors of a bill that would prevent large rate increases as investor-owned utilities increase their renewable portfolio standards. The bill states that the increase in renewables shall not lead to rate increases of greater than 2% in one year or 5% in three years.\Rep. Rod Montoya, R-Farmington, Rep. James Strickler, R-Farmington, and Rep. Ryan Lane, R-Aztec, are sponsoring House Bill 176 along with Rep. Joshua Hernandez, R-Rio Rancho, and Rep. Bill Rehm, R-Albuquerque.\The bill is known as Renewable Energy Standards & Rate Increases. It was introduced on Jan. 25 and has been referred to the House Energy, Environment and Natural Resources Committee.\Bill aims to help utility customers\As COVID-19 has caused job losses and business closures, some utility customers have been unable to pay their bills. The PRC has used moratoriums on disconnects to prevent residential customers from losing their natural gas, electric or water service. Now legislators hope to address these challenges with the Utility Relief Act, or House Bill 206, which was introduced on Jan. 28.\Rep. Kristina Ortez, D-Taos, Rep. Joanne Ferrary, D-Las Cruces, and Rep. Andrea Romero, D-Santa Fe, are sponsoring the bill.\The bill provides guidance for installment payments that will allow customers to pay off their bills over a period of time once the pandemic restrictions have lifted. It also prohibits utilities from disconnecting customers who have entered into an installment payment agreement or who have demonstrated economic hardships. It would also create the utility bill relief program, which would allow low-income residential customers to apply for a temporary credit that will cover half of the unpaid utility bills incurred during the pandemic. If that customer makes the payments in the installment agreement, that credit will become permanent.\It also includes provisions to allow the utility's to recover the lost revenue, including through a rate adjustment. The bill has been referred to the House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee.\Other legislation\House Joint Resolution 7: Rep. James Strickler, R-Farmington, and Montoya, as well as Rep. Rebecca Dow, R-Truth or Consequences, have introduced a joint resolution that would allow qualifying private schools and parents who homeschool their children to receive public school funding.\House Bill 160: Strickler, Dow and Montoya, as well as Rep. Luis Terrazas, R-Santa Clara, have introduced a bill that would require facilities that perform abortions to adhere to certain COVID-safe practices including limiting capacity, enhanced screening and requiring people from out of state to self quarantine.\House Bill 208: Rep. Derrick Lente, D-Sandia Pueblo, is seeking to extend the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women task force for another year and to provide it with $50,000 in funding.\Hannah Grover covers government for The Daily Times.

Granddad holds a baby and small children in other pictures. He is taking his oath of office in yet another photo. A youthful King Spindle holds the Bible where he's placed his right hand.\Subliminal messages have no place in her advertising. King Spindle wants every Democratic voter to know her grandfather was Bruce King, New Mexico's longest-serving governor.\King died in 2009 at age 85. The last of his three terms as governor was from 1991-94.\But his granddaughter hopes he still can influence Democratic voters. In her campaign flyer, the word ""King"" is printed in larger type than Rebecca or Spindle.\""She's leaning pretty heavily on that legacy thing,"" said state Rep. Matthew McQueen, D-Galisteo, the man King Spindle is challenging in the June primary election.\McQueen is running for a fourth term in House District 50, a far-flung area that includes parts of Santa Fe, Bernalillo, Torrance and Valencia counties.\King Spindle, a 45-year-old school board member and cattle rancher from Stanley, says McQueen is out of touch with the southern part of the district. Many people, she said, don't have a voice at the Capitol with him as their representative.\McQueen, 52, is a lawyer and chairman of the House Energy, Environment and Natural Resources Committee.\""I've got a diverse district, and I represent all its interests,"" McQueen said.\He co-sponsored a successful bill this year providing income tax credits for people who install a solar energy system in a home, business or agricultural enterprise.\McQueen last year presented to the House of Representatives the bill by two senators that outlawed coyote-killing contests, which he called an embarrassment to New Mexico.\His attempt to ban animal traps and poisons on public lands failed. But his unsuccessful bill to raise the state gasoline tax is the part of his record that King Spindle focuses on most.\""Higher gas taxes would hurt this district,"" she said. ""More than half of it's rural. I drive 20 miles for groceries.""\McQueen is unbowed. He says he supports an increase in the gas tax to pay for road improvements. McQueen's proposal for higher gas taxes also would provide income tax rebates to low-income residents.\""We have the third- or fourth-lowest gas tax. We also have some of the worst roads in the nation,"" McQueen said. ""Rural roads are in especially bad shape, and that costs people more money in car repairs and insurance.""\King Spindle, a mother of four, serves on the Moriarty-Edgewood school board.\I asked her what she hoped to accomplish if she's elected to the House of Representatives.\""I don't really have an agenda,"" she said.\But what about the deep cuts, in the billions of dollars, that the state Legislature will have to make because the novel coronavirus pandemic has caused unemployment to soar and tax revenue to plunge?\""Change that. Part of my agenda is to protect the agency"" responsible for public schools, she said.\King Spindle described the $18 billion Land Grant Permanent Fund as an emergency fund rather than an endowment with restrictions on how the money can be spent. She said she preferred to tap the permanent fund in this crisis to McQueen's proposal for raising the tax on gasoline.\One of her own written positions in her campaign flyer is perplexing.\""I will sponsor legislation that mandates our working families who are making less than the minimum wage receive 'The New Mexico Prospers Tax Credit,' "" King Spindle stated.\How can a worker be paid less than the minimum wage unless the employer is breaking the law?\Beyond that, New Mexico already has a Working Families Tax Credit, a state program tied to federal income taxes.\Still, the part of King Spindle's ads that stands out is her reliance on her granddad.\Next to her own picture is a quote from Bruce King: ""Remember who you work for if you ever get elected to public office.""\McQueen is critical of her reliance on a famous relative.\""Following in the tradition of public service is one thing. Expecting people to vote for you because of your grandfather is another,"" he said.\Their race might reveal how popular Bruce King is more than a quarter-century after he left office.\His political career ended in defeat in the 1994 race for governor. Upstart Republican Gary Johnson routed King in that election.\King's son, Gary, who is the uncle of King Spindle, ran for governor in 2014. Incumbent Republican Gov. Susana Martinez defeated him by a landslide - 74,000 votes or 14 percentage points.\The winner of the primary between McQueen and King Spindle will be the favorite to take the general election in November.\It might also be a referendum on whether King is still a royal name in Democratic circles.\Ringside Seat is an opinion column about people, politics and news.

This is where the emphasis should be placed.\Pete Ayala\Santa Fe\In good faith\Along the lines of the letter from Bob Thornburg (""In other words,"" Dec. 25), it might be appropriate to reprint President Theodore Roosevelt's speech of 1907. (""In the first place, we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin. ..."") All immigrants would be (and should be) welcomed if they followed his talk. Sad to think not much has changed in 108-plus years.\Kathie Enz\Santa Fe"
194,"""The roads are a significant issue for us in this area.""\NMDOT District 2 Commissioner Dave Sepich\Lawmakers debated the need for road improvements in southeast New Mexico, as the New Mexico Department of Transportation plans numerous major road projects in the region.\During a Tuesday meeting held at New Mexico State University Carlsbad of the New Mexico Legislative Finance Committee, a bipartisan group made up of state representatives and senators, members heard a presentation from NMDOT District 2 Engineer Timothy Parker as he pushed for more state funding for roads in the rural southeastern region of the state.\Parker said his district, which contains Eddy, Lea and Chaves counties, and parts of Otero County, contains 7,750 lane miles, the most of all six districts, but has no interstates.\That distinction, he said, makes it difficult to secure federal funding, and with significant growth in the local oil and gas industry, he said the need is there.\""I won't say everything out here is falling apart, but when you have that traffic from the oilfield, it really tears up the roads,"" Parker said. ""You could have a great looking road on the surface, but what's beneath can be very concerning.""\He challenged state leaders to continue to support southeast New Mexican roads, amid the boom and increased construction costs.\""Now, a lot of the decision making is coming out of Santa Fe,"" Parker said. ""It's basically the same budget we've had since 2008. The reality is the needs have increased. Construction is more expensive. That's just the reality.""\NMDOT District 2 Commissioner Dave Sepich said maintaining and improving oilfield roads is a major objective of the agency.\""The roads are a significant issue for us in this area. We are in the process of trying to address as many of those issues as we can,"" he said. ""The commission has made these oilfield roads one of our top priorities. We know what a benefit they bring to the state.""\Sepich touted the recently convened Southeast New Mexico Roadway Safety Integrated Project, a group organized by NMDOT and Nuclear Waste Partnership, the company that oversees operations at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, to study how to improve safety on highways through infrastructure, enforcement and education.\The group is comprised of local leaders, lawmakers and industry heads who have a stake in the safety of area motorists.\""Part of it is looking at how to repair the roads. A large part of it is also driver education,"" Sepich said. ""We're working very hard on that. We are getting some excellent participation from the oil and gas industry.""\State Rep. Patricia Lundstrom (D-9) asked the NMDOT how state funding was used, and if the agency considered any tax increase proposals to pay for the work.\Sepich said most of the NMDOT's finances go directly into road projects.\""Almost all of it goes to projects,"" he said. ""A lot of these projects around the state have been engineered and are ready to go. Those funds are not going to salaries. They're going to improve the roads.""\As for tax increases, Sepich said the NMDOT has not addressed what he called a political issue, because the agency does not have the power to raise taxes.\He did concede that an oil and gas tax would be helpful, as it charges drivers based directly on how much they use the roads.\""We have not addressed that as a political issue, because we don't have the control,"" he said. ""There's no better way to pay for a road than a gas tax. The user is paying directly into the maintenance. I don't know anywhere else the money is going to come from.""\Lundstrom said policy discussions must continue between lawmakers and the NMDOT to provide the funds needed for safe roadways.\""We have people coming up to Santa Fe and say we need more money because we have bad roads. That's just not how it works. That's not going to work,"" she said. ""Anyone can make the case, statewide. There just simply isn't that federal match there.""\She pointed to recent legislation that directed a portion of the state's general fund revenue into the Road Maintenance Fund, which helps fund NMDOT projects.\The move was already controversial, Lundstrom said, but the debate must continue for roads to be adequately maintained.\""We try to give the districts an even amount. It wasn't easy getting general fund money into your budget,"" she said. ""A few of us opposed that, a few of us supported it. We can't control what you can do. Any of that policy discussion is going to be important.""\Parker argued that the heavy oil and gas development in southeast New Mexico generate state revenue that warrants the area becoming a top priority for funding.\He said U.S. Highway 82 was once as feared as the southern stretch of U.S. Highway 285 – between Orla, Texas, across the state line into Loving.\The first 22 miles of 285, coming north into New Mexico, saw a string of fatal accidents last year, leaving residents fearful and law enforcement struggling to maintain order.\An about $60 million plan to rebuild and improve the road, adding lanes and shoulders, was announced last spring, but the NMDOT only has about half of the needed funds.\The roadway was also recently designated a safety corridor, meaning signage was added, traffic fines were doubled, and local law enforcement began to focus on the area.\The preliminary study alone, Parker said, cost about $3 million, as about 70 sinkholes were found along the way.\""I need ya'll's help to make these things a priority,"" Parker said. ""We need the money to address these issues. If companies are coming in making 20-year investments, they're expecting that to stay. They expect it to pan out.\""You just don't know what you're going to find out here with the oil and gas.""\Aside from heavy, often perilous truck traffic, Sepich said the modern extraction industry requires expensive infrastructure such as access points for job sites and deceleration lanes.\""They want access points, wherever as close as they can get to the field,"" he said. ""It's not just building an old road. It's much more expensive because of the environment we're building them in.""\State Sen. Pat Woods (R-7) said road funding is a challenge felt by the entire state.\""We've got highways falling apart all over the state,"" he said. ""We have tremendous need. I'm not sure how we're ever going to pay for everything we need.""\Adrian Hedden can be reached at 575-628-5516, achedden@currentargus.com or @AdrianHedden on Twitter.\""The roads are a significant issue for us in this area.""\NMDOT District 2 Commissioner Dave Sepich\CAPTION: \Traffic on U.S. Highway 285 near Loving, N.M., begins to roll slowly Feb. 8 as miles of highway is lined with large commercial vehicles.

195," NOVICE GOVERNOR'S DESTINATION CLEAR, BUT GETTING THERE IS ANOTHER MATTER\ Much of what Gov. Gary Johnson wants to do with state government remains a work in progress.\ The directions the 42-year-old Republican governor wants New Mexico government to head in are clear. For starters, he's been aiming to cut down its bulk and to reduce the burdens of bureaucracy on business and taxpayers.\ Johnson, who has acknowledged appreciation for the philosophy of Libertarians and Ross Perot, said in his first State of the State address last January that ""there is an important distinction between what government can do and what it should do.""\ Remembering that he's only been in Santa Fe a year, and that he's met staunch philosophical and political opposition from the Legislature's ruling Democrats, Johnson supporters and others say these are the principal achievements he can point to so far:\ * He managed to knock 3 cents off the state's gasoline tax at the pump.\ * The number of state employees is down by about 500.\ * This year's increase in state general fund spending -- at least as determined earlier this year -- dropped about 2.5 percentage points -- from 8.1 percent to 5.7 percent -- compared to the last year under Democratic Gov. Bruce King.\ Among other initiatives already visibly at work are:\ * The state Motor Vehicle Division is opening a half-dozen satellite offices in Albuquerque to improve service.\ * The state Department of Public Safety is cracking down on uninsured drivers with tickets and tow-aways.\ *The Construction Industries Division has streamlined contractor licensing, partly by reducing applications from 19 to 5 pages.\ *A number of state agencies, like the Regulation and Licensing Department, have taken internal steps to improve efficiency and save money.\ Other key initiatives -- including welfare reform with an emphasis on work, juvenile justice reform and a major task force review of where state government can cut costs and improve efficiency -- remain in the planning stages or are unfolding.\ Still other big endeavors of the Johnson administration have at least temporarily collapsed because of haste, legal problems or legislative opposition.\ Among the most notable of those are: Johnson's quick signing of state-tribal compacts to legalize casino gambling on Indian reservations, since shot down by the state Supreme Court; a plan to eliminate the state Board of Education; and a proposal to restrict Medicaid abortions.\ Still some haze\ Even one of the things supporters point to as real achievement -- reduction of the state gasoline tax -- is not entirely clear-cut progress.\ Although Johnson waged successful political war against the gas- tax hike adopted before he took office, his own special highway needs task force has reported that the state road system now has $1.2 billion worth of pressing needs.\ The task force recommended coming up with the money through either another gas-tax increase, an increase in the gross receipts tax or a major redirection of other state funds. Johnson is expected to reject any tax increase unless it is first submitted to voters.\ Meanwhile, the 500-employee drop is attributable primarily to the closing of one nearly abandoned state hospital and staff reductions at another because of program changes.\ And Johnson's government review task force has reported back that he reduced his own office staff too much, detracting from its ability to deal with the public and some of its routine chores.\ New guys in town\ Johnson has made a mark on his Cabinet and state commissions by reaching into the business world -- unlike some Democratic administrations that relied heavily on old government hands.\ Many of the appointees appear to reflect his free-enterprise thinking and his appreciation for self-driven success.\ Some are new to government, but state lawmakers and constituency groups generally appear to respect their professionalism.\ The selection of Mark Weidler, a geologist who had worked for the oil industry, to head the state Environment Department raised some eyebrows. But Weidler seems to have calmed panic among environmentalists, despite his aim to seek ""voluntary compliance"" from industry on environmental regulations.\ Johnson, who agreed with some of the ideas of the religious right during his campaign, appointed some Christian conservatives and home- schoolers to the state Board of Education. However, he ultimately wants to eliminate the board to give more control over public schools to the governor and local school districts.\ Johnson has ushered in another change: New Mexico government has a different voice than the Democratic administrations of the past.\ The Johnson administration has embraced the conservative, ""New Federalism"" agenda in Congress, makes no bones about taking a hard line on young and adult criminal offenders and rejects the idea of additional taxation without direct public votes.\ It is an administration that says ""no"" to the reintroduction of wolves, ""yes"" to ending federal control of speed limits, ""yes"" to rancher-oriented grazing reform and ""yes"" to transferring ownership of federal land to states and counties.\ It is an administration more likely to look to business for advice and support than to the teacher and public employee unions and the environmental and social service advocates who had such close ties with Democrat administrations.\ Instead of a government insider, the new governor is more like a hostile taxpayer and businessman.\ Down the road\ Drawing on hints from Johnson and the administration's work in progress, here's what you can probably expect in the future on a few key issues.\ * Schools: Johnson has said he wants to put more of the state's ""resources"" into public schools. He'd like to funnel all school money into the public school funding formula and let it be distributed by local school districts, instead of letting legislators have a shot at it first for what he calls their special ""educational pork"" projects.\ * Youth crime: Children, Youth and Families Secretary Heather Wilson is continuing to push her juvenile justice reform program. Elements of the program include work and boot camps, a new ""secure facility"" -- essentially a prison -- for violent offenders, emphasizing foster care, sex offender treatment, juvenile community corrections programs and ""family preservation efforts.""\ * One of Johnson's top priorities for his first year was to get money for building new state prisons, partly because of a court order requiring the closing of about 500-beds worth of antiquated prison space in Santa Fe. But Johnson also wants new prisons in order to cut incarceration costs through design innovation. And he wants enough space to be able to keep violent offenders locked up for the duration of their sentences. Financing and design plans are in the works.\ Observations\ Democrats say Johnson still suffers from inexperience and confusion. Republican Party leaders say that even his few achievements so far are significant. And they say they're confident he'll continue to pursue the rest of his agenda.\ ""I think there is an element of inexperience we have to deal with,"" said Sen. Janice Paster, D-Albuquerque, who has wrestled with the Johnson administration on health care and criminal justice issues.\ Rep. Max Coll, D-Santa Fe, chairman of the House Appropriations and Finance Committee, accuses Johnson of failing to provide clear positions or leadership on the state's declining revenue. And what efforts Johnson has made, Coll said, often have been to ""usurp the Legislature's power to appropriate.""\ House Speaker Raymond Sanchez, D-Albuquerque, has accused Johnson of failing to exert leadership in the legal crisis over state gambling laws.\ State Republican Party Chairman John Dendahl counters on most points that Johnson is ""doing what people wanted him to do: Rein in government and stand up to the Legislature.""\ Dendahl scoffs at criticism of the stumbles and unfinished work of the first year.\ ""Heck, the Congress of the United States is having trouble getting things to move as fast as they want to,"" he said.\ Former state GOP Chairman Edward Lujan said the drop in the number of state employees this year is a remarkable achievement all on its own, noting that it might be the ""first time in history that we have not increased the numbers of employees.""\ At least into September, Johnson appeared to have a majority of voters on his side.\ Johnson won the three-way 1994 election with a bare 50 percent of the vote. In a Journal poll in September of this year, 53 percent of the New Mexico voters surveyed said they approved of the new governor's performance."

""We have a bake sale every week,"" he says of Pecos schools.\ Also, he said water is a state-wide problem. ""Traditional users of water can't have water taken away."" He said he wants to ensure that farmers who depend on acequia systems don't lose water to housing developments and growing populations. Friedman supports a major study of water resources in the state.\ ""I considered myself an environmentalist. Now I'm a conservationist. There are people who make their living off the land. If people who have been here for 300 years abused the land as badly as they have been accused of, who would have moved here?

You can't send prisoners out of state.""\ ""Crime is increasing everywhere I go,"" Friedman said. It is the ""number one job of government"" to provide protection for society from criminals. He supports increased pay for law enforcement personnel.\ Would you oppose state tax increases in every instance?\ Rising property taxes ""penalize the long-time residents. I want to freeze property taxes now."" Property taxes should only rise when a piece of property is sold, he said. Friedman opposes an increase in the state gas tax and would support additional tax increases ""if there is a real financial crisis. People are overtaxed.

""There's still communities without water and sewer,"" said Stefanics, whose focus is on health and human service issues. She said she intends to work closely with state agencies that will be affected by pending cuts in health and human service funding from the federal government.\ Stefanics supports human rights and is an advocate of anti- discrimination and anti-hate crimes legislation. She also supports controls on rising property taxes and would like to see the tax based on income, not property values.\ Stefanics wants to upgrade the quality of teaching materials and improve working conditions for teachers.\ She supports continuation of the New Mexico Health Alliance, a state-authorized private group that provides group rate health insurance to self-employed people or small businesses. She also wants a detailed study of mandatory car insurance to make it more affordable.\ What should be done at the state level about crime?\ Stefanics said she prefers to focus state resources on crime prevention programs rather than on building new prisons or imposing stiffer penalties. ""We should work with families to stop things before they occur,"" she said. Studies show that most criminals have been victims of abuse, and by preventing abuse, crime will be lessened, she said.\ Stefancis said parents must work more closely with their children to emphasize the importance of school work, and public schools should be used by the communities during non-school hours to help build a sense of community.\ Stefanics supports Teen Courts in which teen-agers judge their peers for crimes because they often impose stiffer sentences than adults would on juvenile offenders.\ Would you oppose state tax increases in every instance?\ Stefanics wants a cap on rising property taxes and would like property taxes based on personal income. She supports a tax credit for employers who provide health insurance for their employers. She would support an increase in the state gasoline tax as long as the money generated by the tax goes to road improvements.\ Do you agree with the goals of the Gov. Gary Johnson administration?\ ""The governor's values and mine are different,"" Stefanics said. ""The government's business is to take care of the needs of the state. You can't lose sight of that need. It's not always his policy.""\ Summarize your position toward gambling on Indian lands and gambling elsewhere in the state:\ ""I support Indian sovereignty,"" Stefanics said. ""It's in the courts now. Indians need some economic development.""

The 39th district is made out of mostly rural communities. The job problem in this district is high. There are low paying jobs and not very many. Most people have to go to the city (for jobs). I'm going to be working on economic development. Most politicians talk of economic development as if jobs were going to fall out of the sky. North Carolina changed the anti-donation clause and totally wiped out unemployment in the state. I intend to follow up on it.""\ ""I bring some new blood into Santa Fe. I believe that is what is needed.""\ ""I intend to work for the multiple use of public lands in the state. The Endangered Species Act has gone too far and eliminated a lot of jobs and uses of the public lands by the people of New Mexico. The real environmentalists in the state are the ranchers. Most of our people make a living out of public land. If you can't bring jobs into the state, don't take them out.""\ What should be done at the state level about crime?\ ""Education is far more important because if you have educated children, you have far less crimes when they get older. Education needs a lot of help from the Legislature and the governor.

If it takes building more prisons, then so be it.""\ Would you oppose state tax increases in every instance?\ ""I'm against tax increases. New Mexico is one of the lowest per capita states in the nation and we're one of the highest tax states in the nation as well. Our people have a tough time making it in the rural communities.

Getting a better business environment in the state is a solution to many of the state's problems"" especially if the labor forces of the national laboratories in the state are reduced.\ Bickley wants businesses to pay lower property and corporate income tax because fewer taxes will help businesses grow, hire more people and expand the economy. Bickley said he believes in supply- side economics and favors letting the state's Public Employee Collective Bargaining Act sunset in 1999, which it is scheduled to do. The law has created a financial burden for local and state governments, as well as school boards, he said.\ What should be done at the state level about crime?\ ""I come down on the hard line side,"" Bickley said. ""We're lax on making people pay for the crimes they commit. He supports stiffer sentences for crimes and would like to see more judges willing to impose stricter sentences. ""We've got to find ways to get tougher judges into the system,"" he said. Bickley supports sending New Mexico prisoners to Texas jails because it costs less than keeping them in New Mexico.\ Would you oppose state tax increases in every instance?\ Bickley opposes the current practice of diverting portions of the state gas tax to other programs in state government. He said the entire gasoline tax revenues should be dedicated to road and highway improvements.\ He said state government soon will struggle with funding cutbacks from the federal government in the health and human services area. ""The big challenge is how to deal with all these grants that are coming from the feds,"" because they inevitably will mean cuts in current levels of spending.\ Do you generally agree with the goals of the Gov. Gary Johnson administration?\ Bickley said he generally supports the Johnson administration, but added, ""I'm not entirely in agreement with all the details."" He supports making government more efficient. ""State government is too large. Let's find where the inefficiencies are.""\ Summarize your position toward gambling on Indian lands and gambling elsewhere in the state.\ ""We need a level playing field between Indian and non-Indian gambling interests,"" he said. But he opposes expanding full-scale gambling across the state and placing slot machines in bars, which he called ""an intolerable expansion of gambling. There's no easy way to expand this thing.""\ ""I can see a rolling back of casino gambling with the tribes"" as a result of a future federal court ruling.\ Have you ever been charged with, or convicted of, drunken driving or any felony?\ No."
197,"Editor's note: This is another in an occasional series of opinions about the transforming energy economy of New Mexico and its impact on people's health and the environment.\Since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak in New Mexico, media attention has rightly focused on two things: the health statistics of COVID-19 and the economic impact to our state.\Because our economy is intricately tied to the oil and gas industry, the industry's plight is not far behind in terms of sympathetic media coverage. But lost in the coverage is a far more dangerous crisis that has been brewing even before the pandemic: the devastating impacts of the oil and gas industry on New Mexicans' health.\More than 130,000 New Mexicans live within a half-mile of oil and gas development, and for decades we have known those living close to constant pollution suffer from higher rates of cancer, birth defects, asthma and other serious health issues. The double impact of these pollution health issues and the severe impacts from COVID-19 means strong regulations on the oil and gas industry are more important than ever.\This year, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham's administration released a set of draft rules to limit harmful methane and ozone pollution from oil and gas production in New Mexico.\The rules are a good first step for methane regulation, but the exemptions they contain mean they might not be effective at lowering emissions and protecting the air we breathe. Exemptions for stripper wells and the 15-ton-per-year pollution threshold for volatile organic compounds, for example, would exempt 95 percent of all the wells in New Mexico - huge loopholes.\As a result, these regulations fail communities that have been hardest hit by the pandemic, and once again public health impacts are being pushed to the back burner.\Last year, a group of concerned Carlsbad residents began meeting to discuss the impact of oil and gas in their town. The latest methane emissions data from the Permian Basin are the highest ever recorded. New Mexico already had a methane waste problem that costs the state millions of dollars in revenue, but it is getting worse.\Even though our state is a large oil and gas producer, we have had limited regulations on how to handle methane waste. We have needed these rules and regulations, but the industry has fought against them tooth and nail, arguing that they can regulate themselves.\In the meantime, local communities are left to fend for themselves. For example, the organization Citizens Caring for the Future filed 67 complaints to the New Mexico Environment Department between March 2018 and 2020. Most were met with silence, it said. The group's plight is further documented in a video released recently by the nonprofit Climate Advocates Voces Unidas; we do well to listen to New Mexicans' stories and do more to protect their health.\With the recent plunge in oil and gas tax revenue, we know the governor and Legislature face tough challenges. As they work to support our public health system, they should remember that New Mexicans are in desperate need of protection from methane and ozone - during and beyond the pandemic.\We call on the governor and state regulators to disregard the pushback from the oil and gas industry and be vigilant in enforcing strong regulations to protect the health of all New Mexicans - and call on the Legislature to back them up. As the coronavirus pandemic continues, and well after it is over, we must pay closer attention to the needs of citizens living near oil and gas development, especially those in rural communities and tribal lands where health systems already are stretched thin. If we do not, this will only claim more lives and rob the health of our citizens.\Barbara Webber is the executive director of Health Action New Mexico.\CREDIT: Barbara Webber"

Companies as diverse as solar energy component manufacturer Schott AG and Fidelity Investments located operations here. \Even so, the word many use to describe Richardson's economic legacy is ""mixed."" \A mixed legacy \There were some spectacular miscues, chief among them the multimillion-dollar loss on New Mexico's investment in now-bankrupt Eclipse Aviation -- although some argue that the state recouped those losses through the company's employment and contracting business over the years. A group of insiders who have made a bid for the company says it hopes to emerge from bankruptcy and stay in Albuquerque. \The income tax cuts Richardson pushed through the Legislature have drawn fire from groups that favor more spending on social programs, but praise from the business advocates who argue that it has helped make New Mexico more competitive with neighboring states in the attempt to attract economic development. \In any case, the state faces a shortfall of up to $500 million due to declining oil and natural gas tax revenue and a slowdown in consumer spending. \That's tough medicine for lawmakers who have approved budgets with general fund spending increases averaging 6 percent over the \last decade. \Because Richardson governed an oil- and gas producing state during an era of expanding global demand for energy, some skeptics have concluded he was more lucky than anything else. \Friends & supporters \Then there were the friends of Bill. There is no proof anyone was illegally rewarded for his or her association with the governor, but with uncomfortable frequency Richardson accepted airplane rides and donations from companies hoping to benefit from state government action. Among them were Mesa del Sol developer Forest City Covington and RS Investments, a housing developer with interests in Valencia County. \""There certainly were a lot of instances where companies looked on favorably by the state were also making campaign donations,"" said House Minority Leader Thomas C. Taylor, R-Farmington. ""There is a long list of those. Whether (donations were) a requirement, I don't know. Nevertheless, there is that track record that is there."" \State Sen. Mark Boitano, R-Albuquerque, agrees Richardson has been a great salesman. ""He did a good job of selling the Legislature on Republican tax cuts. The tax cuts sold to the Legislature -- capital gains, tax holidays, personal income -- were all Republican initiatives that didn't go anywhere under the Johnson administration."" \Boitano thinks Richardson gets a lot of credit for economic factors out of anyone's control. ""The reality is, if you take out a couple of years when we were awash in money at the state level, resulting in capital outlay projects statewide, resulting in job creation in public works, and the housing boom we experienced, if you take those jobs off the table, and the state had no control over any of that, the last six years have been remarkably similar to job creation under the Johnson administration."" According to New Mexico Voices for Children research director Gerry Bradley, an economist, ""The power of the executive in the state to affect the economy is always exaggerated. Way exaggerated, both positively and negatively."" Bradley blames Richardson's tax policy for an emerging state fiscal crisis and thinks the state has underfunded important social programs as a result. Still, he said, statistical indicators suggest that Richardson did some good. The data speak An analysis of data from the University of New Mexico Bureau of Business and Economic Research shows: Employment grew at a 2.4 percent annual rate during Richardson's first term compared with a 1.9 percent pace during Gov. Gary Johnson's last term. New Mexico's per capita personal income ranks 44th among the 50 states. It was 48th in Johnson's last year in office. The total state and local tax burden as a percent of residents' personal income is 39th lowest among the 50 states this year, according to the Tax Foundation, and was never higher than 35th since Richardson took office. New Mexico ranked as high as 25th under Johnson and was never lower than 35th. \Some of the job growth should be credited to tax incentives enacted on Richardson's watch, Bradley said. ""You can see the employment growth and income growth in some of those targeted areas,"" he said, including high tech and film industry jobs. \BBER director Lee Reynis isn't sure how much credit Richardson deserves for better times but said the contrast with Johnson's approach to the economy is dramatic. \A question of leadership \During Johnson's second term, the national economy was booming. Gross domestic product grew at better than 4 percent annually, Reynis said. ""New Mexico was going nowhere. We were sitting on the sidelines. Was that Johnson? Was it a whole bunch of things that came together? I don't know. He certainly didn't provide leadership."" \Richardson, on the other hand, ""demonstrated some leadership in some important areas. I won't say I always agreed with where he took things, but I think as a resident of New Mexico in some ways it was nice to have somebody on the top who was trying to come to grips with some big issues and take some stands and try and move the state in some directions."" \""I think he was impatient with New Mexico,"" said Santa Fe attorney and lobbyist Gary Kilpatrick. ""He wanted to do a lot. He would appoint task forces, and they would come back with recommendations that weren't bold enough. He took us out of our comfort zone sometimes because he was impatient. I think that was a good thing."" \'Business friendly' \""The key to the Richardson vision is the fact the state has become much more business friendly,"" said state Economic Development Secretary Fred Mondragn. He offers a long list of supporting examples, among them: \Incentives for film production that brought $650 million into the state last year and produced employment for up to 4,000 people. \State investment in venture capital funds that in turn invest in New Mexico companies. \The Spaceport project that is starting to attract commercial space ventures, beyond the high-profile Virgin Galactic plan to launch space tourists. \The fastest supercomputer in the nation that is available for commercial users. \Incentives that have brought alternative energy companies to the state, with several more on the way. \Publishing mogul Steve Forbes, whose Forbes magazine declared Albuquerque one of the nation's best places to do business, told the Journal in a telephone interview while traveling in London that he became curious about Richardson because the governor ""wanted to attract business to New Mexico and he was allegedly a Democrat."" \Richardson's is ""the kind of legacy I hope the incoming Obama administration will take to heart. Bill Richardson is a free trader. He has worked aggressively overseas putting out the welcome mat to business for New Mexico."" \Getting out and about \Association of Commerce and Industry president Beverlee McClure lived in Clovis for eight years, became president of the local community college and was eventually named Richardson's higher education secretary. ""We saw Gov. Richardson (in Clovis) more than any governor previous to that. There is a cheese plant now in Clovis, and the reason for that was Bill was willing to step in and meet with the decision makers of (Southwest Cheese Co.) and really close the deal for us. If you want to look at his legacy, there are people in Clovis now who are working because he cared about the rural areas."" \Kilpatrick said he worked closely with the governor to help Louisiana Energy Services build a nuclear fuel plant near Eunice. The project ""had serious environmental concerns. The governor recognized the value in terms of economic activity and jobs in the area. He also wanted to be sure there wasn't a tradeoff that was harmful to the environment. He did a good job of creating a win-win situation there."" \And HCSC, the Chicago company Richardson visited, expanded its Albuquerque operations, though it has so far not ventured into Las Cruces. Some of the failures are very high profile, especially Eclipse Aviation. Eclipse settled in Albuquerque 10 years ago with a plan to produce low-cost, small jets for corporate fleets, hob\Due diligence \Due diligence \byists and air taxi services. Over time, the state loaned and invested $19 million in Eclipse, and the company eventually employed close to 2,000 people. But Eclipse couldn't build the planes for the targeted cost and started laying off people. It sought bankruptcy court protection last month. The state expects to lose $13 million on the deal and the 950 remaining employees may still lose their jobs if the new owner who is expected to take the company over next year moves it out of state. There was Richardson's bid to land an NFL team and Tesla, which was to build electric cars in New Mexico but decamped to California (without costing the state money). There was Millennium Transit Services, which got a $2 million state loan for a bus factory in Roswell, then filed for bankruptcy court protection. There was Bombardier Aerospace, a Canadian aircraft maker that solicited (but did not receive) state incentives to relocate here as a bargaining chip with its labor unions. ""Not every deal works,"" Mondragn said. ""Not every technology works. There will be failures."" Reynis asks if the state is vetting some deals properly. ""Some things we looked at, it seemed like the due diligence was missing,"" she said. Competitors with experience and deep pockets didn't try to create the kind of plane Eclipse proposed. ""Could the state have done better diligence in terms of looking at that deal and seeing that the basic business plan was flawed?"" Reynis asked. On balance, said House Minority Leader Taylor, business has fared pretty well under Bill Richardson, though Taylor faults the state's regulatory environment for discouraging business, especially in the oil and gas industry. ""I always admired the tenacity with which he did the job,"" Taylor said. ""I never saw anybody who worked so hard and worked his staff so hard to promote his vision."" In his statement nominating Richardson to be his commerce secretary, Presidentelect Barack Obama said, ""I know Bill will be an unyielding advocate for American business and American jobs, at home and around the world."" Richardson's supporters and detractors, if they agree on little else, can probably agree on that."
199,"The Legislative Education Study Committee roadshow heads to Santa Teresa High School this week where it will hear from educators and researchers about the benefits of a multicultural approach in improving student outcomes.\This year, the legislature has a chance to get us closer to the moonshot that we all want by designing an education system that puts student learning first. The system must be rooted in the linguistic and cultural assets of our New Mexico communities and provide the teaching environment and resources necessary for our students to succeed in school.\There is much work to do. The 2019 Kids Count Data Book released last week ranks New Mexico last for child well-being. Our education system fails our kids for two primary reasons. First, the state does not provide the resources necessary for teachers and students to succeed. And second, the state has not shifted investment to the programs and services we know work for improving outcomes.\Earlier this year the legislature failed to pass critical bills, including legislation to establish universal Pre-K, address the unique needs of English language learners, Native American students and children from low-income families, and provide the funding, wraparound services and instruction students need to be ready for college and careers.\Two-thirds of New Mexico students are Hispanic or Native American and many speak a language other than English at home. Adopting a more culturally relevant approach to teaching has been shown to be a win-win for all students. Numerous studies have found that a multicultural curriculum benefits both non-English speaking and English-speaking students.\Most importantly, we need teachers who can tailor their approach to the unique cultural and linguistic needs of our students. That means more bilingual teachers and teachers trained to teach speakers of other languages to meet students where they are. It means investing in workforce development to attract and retain more teachers ready to provide culturally and linguistically responsive education. It means promoting bilingualism, because we know the many cognitive benefits for all students, English-language learners and English-speaking students alike.\My hope for the legislators who travel to southern New Mexico this week is that they will really listen. That they won't settle for the same old approach to education in New Mexico or look for excuses for the shortcomings of our education system. Our children are too important.\Especially at this moment, when state coffers are full of oil and gas tax revenue, we need to live up to our responsibility to the next generation. We must invest in what works: a new approach to education that reflects the diversity of cultures, languages and identities in New Mexico.\Here's a starting point for the legislature to demonstrate its commitment to kids and a prosperous New Mexico for all:\Provide preschool to all 4-year-olds.\Provide extended learning opportunities to all children who need them.\Ensure social services, counseling, health care and literacy specialists are available to all students who need them.\Invest enough in our educators to attract and retain new teachers and expand their qualifications.\Cover culturally and linguistically appropriate instruction materials for the classroom.\Provide enough buses so all students have the opportunity to participate in after school and summer programs.\Ensure teaching is tailored to the unique cultural and linguistic needs of our students.\Victoria Tafoya is the project manager for Transform Education NM.\CREDIT: Victoria Tafoya"
200,"The money is there: It's the political will that is needed.\Daily news details the impact of the coronavirus health and economic crises on New Mexico, the United States and the world. It came upon us hard and fast, exposing the underlying vulnerabilities for people and the planet.\Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and her administration promptly responded to this crisis and advised that closing nonessential businesses, stay-at-home orders, social distancing, face masks and frequent hand-washing were the most effective mitigation measures.\The closing of businesses and the dramatic drop in oil prices hit the state hard, spiking unemployment and significantly reducing state and local revenues. Much-appreciated federal economic aid has been of assistance but has been grossly insufficient and in some cases misdirected and poorly executed.\Given these adversities, how do we rebuild our state, our communities, our businesses and our families in this new, more sensitive public health environment? From American history, we learn that social and economic catastrophes, world wars, depressions and epidemics have been successfully managed by rapidly instituted, significantly funded and focused programs. Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal following the Great Depression is an excellent example of massive government programs designed to provide immediate and major economic boosts to people across the country.\In the 2020 New Mexico legislative session, our state leaders moved us toward where we should be. New Mexico has been gradually and successfully expanding and upgrading our education systems from pre-K through higher education, diversifying our economies to support food systems, farmers and ranchers, wind and solar energy, increasing broadband accessibility and support for artists, movie production and eco-tourism.\To build on that progress, we need a massive shot in the arm to move us out of this economic crisis and into the 21st century.\Whatever our economic problems, we also have resources that can be effectively applied for redevelopment needs; for example:\The Land Grant Permanent Fund, one of the largest in the United States.\Tax and wage fairness: a more equitable gross receipts tax formula, gas tax increase and fair wages for critical/essential workers.\Technology: national lab and university/college support for small startups and needed professionals (telemedicine, nurses, teachers, greenhouses and soil regeneration, safe local food processing and distribution, etc.).\The Land Grant Permanent Fund is worth about $17 billion. We can thank outgoing Sen. John Arthur Smith, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who has guarded that fund for many years.\If ever there were a crisis necessitating tapping the land grant fund, this coronavirus pandemic must qualify. It's the most devastating storm to hit New Mexico since the Great Depression. Tax structures and fair wages require bipartisan work to make them more equitable and to reflect the value of critical and essential workers. Tapping these resources is the only way to rebuild our economy, our livelihoods and our state.\The real issue is not the availability of funds to rebuild our state; it is a question of political will. Do our state leaders have the political will to initiate a New Mexican New Deal, to make bold decisions to jump-start the rebuilding of our state, our businesses and our family livelihoods?\It would be more efficient and effective if only we already had a New Mexico Public Bank. Then, all rebuilding investments would be financed through it in collaboration with our community banks and credit unions. A state public bank is surely in our future, but until then, we need to ask our legislators to show the political will needed to rebuild our state when they meet in the upcoming special session. We need to let them know we are counting on them.\George Gamble, Ph.D., is vice chairman of the Santa Fe Community College governing board and a member of the board for the Alliance for Local Economic Prosperity.

201,"By statute, the New Mexico Legislature makes it clear with emphasis that one duty of the Oil Conservation Division is ""to prevent waste prohibited by this act and to protect correlative rights, as in this act provided."" (NMSA 70-2-11). \Yet the public doesn't trust the division to protect the environment from methane emissions, which is waste, not conservation, and specifically addressed in the statute. \The division could and should lead in enforcing the requirements already existing in the enabling legislation. This is a short-run cost of doing business for the oil and gas industry, but would benefit public health concerns and the state's economy in the long run. Goodwill seems lacking at this time in the oil-and-gas-industry-profits approach to extracting its products. \Most of us know the reasons that the public is finally waking up and speaking up regarding the oil and gas industry processes and especially fracking and methane emissions. But the division follows the industry instead of helping to guide it. This is a negligent and destructive behavior that can possibly do long-term harm to the economy of New Mexico, the education of New Mexicans and the health of New Mexicans. \The oil and gas industry is an important stakeholder in our success as a state. This is not going to change in the very near future. But industry leaders must operate in a manner conducive to the longevity of the industry and the environmental concerns of the public. \I see the Oil Conservation Division's current role and direction as a deterrent to any possible long term economic recovery for oil and gas in New Mexico. This is because of their reluctance, or inability for whatever reasons, to curb the selfish profit-oriented appetites of the industry. This profit-at-any-cost business model is counterproductive, and it is simply destroying the goodwill of the industry. Current extraction and production processes need to change. \I believe that our legislators should make a bipartisan effort to convince the oil and gas industry in New Mexico and the division to placate the growing public sentiments, especially in the Albuquerque Basin, which provides water to nearly a million people, and if comprehensive oil and gas ordinances aren't adopted and adhered to, should be declared a no-drill basin. \The push for oil and gas ordinances is growing nationwide, and it will continue to grow in New Mexico unless Goliath quits bullying its way around the needs of the people. Our air and water are important, and our education and many other benefits of oil and gas tax income are also very important. Business as usual needs to change. \We all drive our cars, and we all benefit from severance taxes. Quality education is vital to our state's future. Currently our educational system is overly dependent on an oil and gas industry that has potential to do both good and harm to our health, safety and general welfare. The negatives are becoming more and more apparent, but the oil and gas industry prefers to ignore growing public concerns. We all drink water and breathe air and rely on foods grown in uncontaminated soils. An industry that ignores the future for today's profits should not be allowed to take us all down with it. This would seem a no-brainer. Change the business plan now. It's not too late. \Mike Neas lives in Placitas.\Credit: Mike Neas"
202," There are supposed to be huge differences between the Republican and Democratic parties on the subject of taxes.\ Democrats think rich people and businesses should pay proportionately more taxes and the poor less.\ Republicans, while they might agree that the poor should pay less, think the rich and businesses should pay less, too. Especially in New Mexico, where the state might rack up a revenue surplus of $300 million for the second year in a row.\ Listen to each party's candidate for governor, though, and you will hardly hear any differences at all. Nor do they have much different to say on the subject of economic development.\ Republican Gary Johnson still uses his party's hard-line rhetoric on taxes, calling the state's tax burden on businesses ""crushing.""\ But Johnson has abandoned the hard-line, cut-those-taxes position he took in the primary. Then, he said he would eliminate the special six-cent gasoline tax imposed last year and wipe out gross receipts taxes on food, medicine and business services.\ Johnson still says he'll eliminate the gasoline tax. He'll eliminate the tax on medicine, too. But he says he'll reduce other taxes only if he can do it and still maintain government services, not to mention pay for the extra prisons his anti-crime package is going to require.\ If that sounds a lot like what Gov. Bruce King has been saying all along, it's because it is. Last year, King called for eliminating the gas tax but backed off when it became clear, in January, that the Legislature's Democratic leadership wouldn't go for it. The governor compromised with a one-cent decrease in the tax plus a transfer of one cent to the road fund.\ King and the Democrats pushed through a bill restoring tax credit for medicine purchases and passed an income-tax reform measure. Altogether, King calculates his tax changes will return $72 million to taxpayers over three years.\ In view of all that, King doesn't seem to be talking about more tax reform if he's elected to another term.\ Nor is the Green Party proposing anything radical in the way of tax changes. Like Johnson, Green candidate Roberto Mondragon would eliminate the gross receipts taxes on medicine. Mondragon would like to see the tax on food eliminated, too.\ Mondragon also wants property tax credits to protect the elderly and the poor from the effects of soaring real estate values in places like Santa Fe and Taos. The Legislature already has passed a bill allowing counties with booming real estate markets to give tax rebates to low-income residents.\ But Mondragon also wants a tax on the transfer of real estate to offset the loss in revenue the low-income property tax breaks would cost state and local governments. A similar proposal failed to pass the Legislature this year.\ There are only shades of difference between the candidates on the subject of economic development as well.\ King takes credit for the state's remarkable economic growth and says we can expect more of the same. He also takes credit for persuading Intel, a computer chip manufacturer, to expand its Rio Rancho plant to become one of the biggest in the world.\ King has been criticized for encouraging the growth of industries like chip manufacturing that use huge amounts of water. He has also been criticized for wooing Intel with preferential tax breaks.\ In the next four years, King says, he'll focus on expanding existing businesses and on spreading the economic boom, currently focussed in Albuquerque, to other areas of the state.\ Johnson says he isn't opposed to special tax incentives to lure out-of-state industries to New Mexico, although he also says he thinks the focus of economic development should be on businesses that are already here.\ He also advocates a more global approach to economic development, including improvements in education and infrastructure as part of his plan to promote growth.\ Mondragon says tax breaks should be aimed at small businesses already in New Mexico. And the state should be wary of luring too many outsiders here, he says, because overpopulation and over- development could adversely affect both the environment and the quality of life."

204," A national coalition of businesses -- including companies such as Intel, Motorola, Sunsoft Corp. and Lasertechnics that have operations in New Mexico -- is lobbying Congress to change a federal law that appears to outlaw the use of employee teams to resolve workplace issues.\ ""We use teams to discover problems,"" said Harold ""Skip"" Pascoe, executive officer of manufacturing and distribution at Albuquerque- based Sunsoft Corp. ""The employees are the ones closest to the problems, they know the processes better than anyone in the company, and they certainly make the most common-sense recommendations on how to make our operations more efficient.""\ Pascoe was part of a small group of New Mexico executives who traveled to Washington, D.C., last week to seek change in a provision of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. That provision has been interpreted to mean a company can't establish employee groups to discuss some workplace issues.\ The bill seeking the change is the Teamwork for Employees and Management Act, or TEAM Act. It passed the House of Representatives last September by a narrow 221-202 margin.\ The bill would allow managers and workers in non-union companies to get together to discuss workplace issues, but it prohibits them from engaging in collective bargaining.\ The Senate is scheduled to vote on the bill this week as part of a package that will include repeal of the gas tax and the minimum-wage increase.\ The New Mexico group visited Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., and explained their concerns. They got a convert.\ ""I think it's appropriate to clarify the proposal so that both unions and the companies are satisfied,"" Bingaman said.\ Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said he also supports changing the law. Domenici said unions should not be worried about the bill, because it says it will not change the way any union currently deals with management.\ However, President Clinton has called TEAM a ""poison pill"" that would undermine worker rights. Democratic opponents say the law is unnecessary because current law allows legitimate cooperation programs.\ The AFL-CIO is also opposed to the proposal, saying it could squelch union organizing. Labor Secretary Robert Reich has argued against the bill because of the danger of company-dominated unions.\ ""We're willing to clarify existing law, but this utterly changes existing law,"" said Peggy Taylor, legislative director for the AFL- CIO.\ The TEAM Act grew out of a 1992 National Labor Relations Board decision that an Indiana company violated the National Labor Relations Act's prohibition against ""employer-assisted"" labor organizations when it brought together workers and managers to discuss pay, smoking and attendance policies.\ Supporters of the TEAM Act say companies should be able to emulate without fear of lawsuit the ""Total Quality Management"" practice of labor-management cooperation that has been so successful in Japan.\ Supporters of change point to contradictory rulings on the existing law by the NLRB.\ For example, in one case, the NLRB decided it was OK to discuss extending breaks by five minutes when the work has been completed early. In another ruling, however, the NLRB said it was illegal to discuss extending worker lunch breaks by 15 minutes.\ The roster of companies supporting the change is heavy with manufacturers, both union and non-union. The list includes General Electric Co., Boeing, IBM, Motorola and Lockheed-Martin.\ Eugene Bourque, CEO of Albuquerque-based Lasertechnics, notes that many of the companies are in high-tech industries that were formed after the 1935 act. Many of those employers provide high pay, good working conditions and give their workers considerable autonomy, he said.\ His manufacturing company, which employs about 75 people and makes laser-marking equipment, has used employee teams to address many issues, Bourque said. If workers want to unionize, they still have a right to, but some may feel it's unnecessary if working conditions are good and job satisfaction is high, he said.\ ""(The current work environment) is totally contradictory to the classic paradigm of confrontation -- a separation of labor and management,"" Bourque said. ""We have a high regard for our employees' intelligence and we want their input.""\ Material from the Associated Press was incorporated in this report."
205," TO THE GOVERNOR\ Cyberhunting Ban OK'd\ SANTA FE -- The Legislature has sent Gov. Bill Richardson a bill banning so-called cyberhunting and the establishment of computer- assisted hunting sites in New Mexico.\ New Mexico was among a number of states considering whether to restrict hunting over the Internet, prompted by a Web site in Texas that had planned to allow people to shoot live game by controlling a camera-equipped rifle with a computer.\ The bill was sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Michael Sanchez, D-Belen.\ Fire Fund Bill Advances\ SANTA FE -- The Legislature has sent Gov. Bill Richardson a bill intended to provide more money for fire departments across the state.\ Supporters said volunteer and rural fire departments particularly need the additional funding.\ The legislation increases the amount of money that departments receive from the state's fire protection fund, which is financed by a tax on some insurance premiums.\ The yearly distribution from the fund to fire departments will increase from $24 million to about $30 million. Then there will be annual increases of about $2.5 million over the next decade.\ Gov. Gets Gambling Bill\ A bill (HB 267) that would establish standards for compulsive gambling treatment and create a compulsive gambling council is on the governor's desk.\ The measure, sponsored by Rep. Kandy Cordova, D-Belen, unanimously passed the Senate this weekend.\ ENERGY\ Electric Agency Bill OK'd\ SANTA FE -- The Senate and the House on Monday each endorsed its own version of Gov. Bill Richardson's proposal for a quasigovernmental authority to plan and finance new electric transmission lines.\ The Senate bill passed unanimously. The House measure passed 50- 8, over the objections of lawmakers who said its powers would be too sweeping.\ The administration says it would encourage more renewable energy production in the state because 30 percent of the electricity transmitted would have to be from renewable sources, such as sun or wind.\ It would have the power of eminent domain to acquire property for transmission lines, it could issue bonds to help pay for construction of projects, and it could enter into leases with utilities to operate the lines financed by the authority.\ PROPERTY\ Senate OKs Land Proposal\ SANTA FE -- The Senate unanimously approved a proposal Monday to limit the ability of the state or local governments to seize private property and use it for private economic development projects.\ The bill, which goes to the House, would prohibit the state or local governments from using eminent domain powers to take property and turn it over to a developer or other ""private entity"" within five years of the property's condemnation.\ HEALTH\ Rep. Wants Flu Bill Held\ SANTA FE -- A proposed limitation on mercury-containing flu vaccines apparently is being laid to rest in the Legislature in return for voluntary action.\ ""Rep. Rhonda King has asked that House Bill 271 be placed on the speaker's table,"" Randy Marshall, executive director of the New Mexico Medical Society, said in an e-mail to his members Monday.\ He was referring to action that can put legislation on hold for the remainder of the session, which ends Thursday.\ King would not confirm the agreement, saying through a spokeswoman that a final decision was pending.\ Marshall said the Clinical Prevention Initiative, a joint project of the Medical Society and Department of Health, will seek ways to reduce the exposure of children 8 and younger and pregnant women to vaccines with thimerosal.\ YEAR OF THE CHILD\ Denish Given Cow Bone\ Cabinet Secretary Mary-Dale Bolson lightened things up on the Senate floor last week when she presented Lt. Gov. Diane Denish with an enormous cow bone, picked almost bare of meat.\ ""This is my bare-bones budget,"" the Children, Youth and Families secretary whispered to Denish as the lieutenant governor presided over the session.\ Bolson got the bone from Roundhouse caterers. She was taking it home to her Airedale dog.\ ENVIRONMENT\ Conservation Bill Passes\ Lt. Gov.

206," NAMB PUEBLO GOVERNOR DREAMS UP FUTURISTIC CASINO AND THEME PARK ALONG THE U.S. 84/285 CORRIDOR, BUT NOT ALL TRIBAL LEADERS ARE ON BOARD\ NAMB PUEBLO -- Nambe Pueblo Gov. Tom Talache Jr. wants tribal members to approve a plan to build a futuristic 50,000-square-foot casino and family-oriented theme park on 15 acres along U.S. 84/285 near Pojoaque.\ He believes the venture, located within 20 miles of four other American Indian casinos, would generate\ a share of profits from\ $30 million in annual casino revenues for the tribe. But some members of the tribe, and even some members of the tribal council, fear the casino will lead to increased social problems.\ Talache's challenge now is to convince the tribe's 650 members to support his vision.\ ""Since I've been in office, I've been trying to find funding sources for the pueblo,"" said Talache, 36, who has been governor for two and a half years. ""I've been promoting the heck out of this in newsletters (sent to tribal members) -- I'm hoping and praying they will support it,"" he said.\ After spending 10 years trying to create economic development in the tribe through other means -- such as partnering in federal programs to bring jobs and money to the pueblo -- Talache said the nine member tribal council recently approved gambling. But there's dissent among councilors, the governor said. Tribal members still must decide on the fate of the proposed casino in an Oct. 2 referendum that will answer the question by a simple majority. If tribal members approve gambling, they will join 13 other pueblos among 19 in New Mexico that have casinos.\ Talache chose to discuss details surrounding the proposed casino with The New Mexican because, after information about the venture was leaked to the media last month, rumors began circulating about the casino, he said. ""I wanted to set the record straight.""\ A tribal member who declined to be named said Friday that he is concerned a casino will bring many problems for the ancient tribe, which has long been referred to as conservative. Many members of Indian pueblos refuse to comment publicly about tribal issues because they prefer to defer to the tribe's leader as their spokesman. Corruption, addiction and division among tribal members are among the problems gambling could bring, said the tribal member.\ ""I see how many people (who go to casinos) spend their Social Security checks, lose homes and are divorcing,"" he added.\ The governor said some members of the tribal council who were opposed to gambling now support a casino, but other councilors continue to reject the idea. The tribe's seven-member Nambe Pueblo Economic Development Corp. -- the economic division of the pueblo that has a non-Indian member -- voted against pursuing the gambling venture, Talache said. Other tribes' economic-development corporations operate casinos on reservations.\ The governor has been researching the proposed casino, and since April has been working with Full House Resorts, a publicly traded resort- and casino-development company based in Las Vegas, Nev.\ If Nambe approves the casino, Full House will hiring construction contractors to begin planning and building the casino on tribal- owned land in Cuyamungue along U.S. 84/285 near Pojoaque.\ In a property trade eight years ago, Nambe Pueblo received the land -- near Pojoaque Pueblo's Jose Antonio Tapia Building -- from Pojoaque with the provision that Nambe would not build a casino on it until this year. The trade allowed Nambe -- which owns 19,000 acres, much of which is sacred -- to gain part of a road leading to property the pueblo owned near the highway.\ The facility would include 500 slot machines, eight card games and could open in a year, said Greg Violette, executive vice president of development for Full House.\ The first phase of the project -- which is estimated to cost $30 million -- includes a casino and food-and-beverage outlet, Violette said. Other phases would include hotel rooms, an event center and an amusement park with a miniature-golf course, bumper cars and a water- slide park. Water -- which is a contentious subject in New Mexico -- would come from a recycled source, Violette said. If the market supports it, the tribe could expand gambling at the location in the future.\ Talache, who is a fan of the Star Trek television show and movies, is planning an entertainment park for children that would include space- and extraterrestrial-themed programs to teach youngsters about life on other planets and traveling into space, he said. The circular-shaped casino -- which is also related to round forms in the Indian world -- will symbolize that vision, Talache said. ""It will have an outer-space theme, and the casino may look like a space ship,"" Violette said.\ The building ""emanates from a round center and radiates from that,"" said Marc Schiff, an architect with DCSW Architects, which has offices in Santa Fe and Albuquerque. Beams of lights -- in which the color and height can be modified -- will shoot into the sky from the top of the casino. Nambe's gambling establishment would be unlike other pueblo-themed casinos in New Mexico, Schiff said. The strip of casinos in Pojoaque could eventually mimic a ""family friendly"" Las Vegas, Nev., Talache said.\ Governors of the tribes of Santa Clara, Pojoaque and Tesuque said recently that Nambe's casino would create competition for their casinos. However, the governors also acknowledged Nambe's right -- as that of other tribes -- to pursue gambling. Other nearby gambling establishments include San Juan Pueblo's Ohkay Casino, Santa Clara's Big Rock Casino, Pojoaque Pueblo's Cities of Gold Casino and Tesuque Pueblo's Camel Rock Casino.\ Nambe's casino would be down the highway from Cities of Gold Casino and less than a mile from that tribe's Towa Golf Course and its Hilton destination resort currently under construction.\ Market studies on the proposed casino show it could take away 5 percent in profits from nearby gambling establishments, Talache said. A 70-page report conducted by a Minneapolis marketing firm includes data on local population, demographics, income locations, competitive environments and transportation infrastructure, Violette said. ""We expect the impact on the other casinos will be minimal,"" he added.\ Full House is betting that the amusement-park aspect of the project will fill a niche in the child-entertainment industry in Northern New Mexico and could draw more visitors to the area. People are likely to drive further if there are more options, he added. Talache also wants to partner with NASA to bring entertainment and education programs to the location, where schoolchildren could also visit on field trips. Talache has not yet spoken to NASA about the idea.\ Talache said he is interested in hiring Full House as its consultant because one of the company's principals is former automobile-industry magnate Lee Iacocca. The governor, who held a copy of Iacocca's book Straight Talk, said he has long respected the businessman's vision.\ If the tribe approves gambling, Nambe will enter into a seven- year profit-sharing agreement with Full House. The company will receive 30 percent of the venture's profits while Nambe will receive 70 percent. After the seven-year contract ends, the tribe will receive 100 percent of the profits and decision-making ability. At that time, the pueblo can decide whether it will continue to retain Full House as its consultant and manager of the casino. The casino will provide between 400 and 500 jobs, Violette said. Full House representatives, who have helped about a dozen other tribes in the United States start casinos, will train Nambe's employees.\ Violette, who said Full House would provide 100 percent of the money for the project, declined to discuss details of how the project would be financed. If the tribe goes into gambling, it would have to renegotiate a 1997 revenue-sharing compact it entered into with the state in the event it decided to go into gaming in the future. Under new compacts with other tribes, the state receives a maximum\ 8 percent of slot-machine\ proceeds.\ Money from the proposed casino would provide money for badly needed projects in Nambe, such as housing, roads, water and sewer systems and services for children and seniors, Talache said. The tribe mainly relies on its Nambe Falls recreation area and\ $2 million annually in state gas-tax proceeds paid to the tribe for opting out of the gasoline-selling business to support the pueblo. ""We're like panhandlers begging for money from the government every time we need something,"" Talache said. Self- determination is his goal for the tribe.\ Once the casino project begins to generate money, Talache said, he wants the tribe to diversify into other types of businesses, including a bank that would provide money to finance homes on tribal land. Banks have many regulations about home mortgages on sovereign land, he added. Casino profits would allow tribal members to pursue education and send their children to good schools.\ The casino would not provide per-capita payments -- or revenue- sharing proceeds -- to its members, Talache said. Per-capita payments tend to create a dependency of tribal members, he said.\ The casino project isn't the only idea Talache -- who has a business background -- has in mind. He recently negotiated the purchase of a large plot of land and water rights in Santa Fe for the building of an IMAX theater. That project, which Talache declined to comment on, will begin within six months, he said.\ ""I'm a dreamer,"" Talache acknowledged. ""The only time I'll get bored is if people no longer listen to me.""\ (Sidebar)\ Nambe Pueblo facts and figures\ Tribal members: 650\ Pueblo established: 1300\ Pueblo name: Nambe Owingeh (pueblo of roundish ruins)\ Land: Owns 19,000 acres\ Governor: Tom Talache Jr.\ Lt. governor: Jennifer Vigil\ Language: Tewa\ Feast days: Oct. 4 and King's Day, Jan. 6\ Enterprises: Nambe Lake and recreation area; 150-acre\ industrial park\ Full House Resorts Inc.\ Company age: 17\ Based: Las Vegas, Nev.\ Founder: The late Allen Paulson\ Chairman: Michael Paulson\ Chief executive officer: Andre M.

Where is yours?\ Roy Silverman\ Santa Fe\ Better transportation\ Concerning our transportation crisis it seems like a no-brainer to me. We need a partnership between the federal and state government in the form of alternatives to our fossil fuel love affair. To start with we need to stop giving subsidies (welfare) to the oil companies and start paying the real cost of gasoline. The cost to the environment is enormous. And I question why the poor and the middle class should be saddled with paying for these substitutes. At the state level we could charge 30 or 40 percent more for cars that get poor gas mileage when registered. Once gain there is no good reason that the whole population should be subsidizing the wasteful practice of people who want to drive gas guzzling cars. If they want to drive environmentally destructive machines they should pay their fair share.\ A real change in public transportation is not giving to occur until we take responsibility on how we are destroying our children's world by our wasteful practice. The monies collected by gas tax and increased registration fee's could be used to fund quality public transportation.\ Robert F.

208,"A strong, modern and efficient transportation system is good for everyone in the United States regardless of politics, geography or profession. Almost every American uses the road and rail network paid for with the help of federal dollars. Last year we logged 2.9 trillion vehicle miles on our roads, and in New York City alone, people boarded the subway 1.6 billion times.\That is why, for the last 50 years, paying for our transportation infrastructure has invariably been a bipartisan effort, with funding for roads, bridges and trains widely supported by both parties in both houses of Congress.\That tradition continued last week when the Senate overwhelmingly approved a $109 billion highway bill first drafted by Democrat Barbara Boxer and Republican James Inhofe. The two senators who in many ways symbolize the most conservative and most liberal wings of their respective parties struck a bipartisan compromise that's most rare these days.\So it was with great disappointment that we've watched the companion legislation in the House get bogged down in the partisan bickering that has stalled many good ideas and eroded the goodwill that sustains our system of government.\Instead of emulating the Senate, the House transportation committee approved a bill on a party-line vote, and House Republicans promised to tack on provisions to stop setting aside federal gasoline taxes for public transit and to expand offshore oil drilling. Those measures, designed to attract Republican votes, drove Democrats away. This approach broke the half-century precedent of working across the aisle to pay for our nation's transportation infrastructure.\The result was a partisan plan with no Democratic support whose price tag -- $260 billion over five years -- drove away too many Republicans to get it approved.\Some of the House's broad goals -- eliminating duplicative and wasteful programs and creating long-term certainty in the transportation budget -- are admirable and broadly embraced. Pursing these shared goals through a divisive process is unnecessary and unfortunate.\Few doubt that our nation's transportation infrastructure is in sore need of an upgrade. This critical national asset, which is essential to the success of every enterprise in this country, is not keeping up with our growing economy and population. At the same time, gas tax revenues are lagging in part because of the increased fuel efficiency of our vehicles. The default response, to rely on general tax revenue, is unwise and unsustainable.\We believe there's a need for more investment in surface transportation, yet we also understand the very real need to cut the deficit and the debt. In the current political and economic climate, there's little apparent taste to increase the federal motor fuels taxes either in the administration or in Congress. That leaves us with the imperative to pay for the roads, bridges, trains and buses that we need while keeping costs at manageable levels.\The Bipartisan Policy Center has laid out a plan that meets these requirements. Our proposal, developed by former elected officials, transportation experts, and a diverse group of civic, labor and business leaders ties transportation spending more closely to the revenues that are collected specifically for highways, transit and other transportation infrastructure. Lawmakers, if they are so inclined, can embrace it without continuing the partisan fight.\The basic premise of our plan is that Congress must define specific priorities for transportation funding and then the trust-fund money will go to meet those goals. BPC proposed five goals: economic growth; national connectivity; metropolitan accessibility; energy security and environmental protection; and safety.\Testing each spending proposal against these goals eliminates pet-projects that serve no national interest and cuts funding that goes to states simply to create an aura of fairness. The largest program that we eliminate is the Equity Bonus Program, which allocates more than $9 billion a year to projects not on their merit but on returning to states federal revenues raised within their borders.\In the current budget environment, there's no room for such programs.\In addition to eliminating programs and earmarks, the BPC proposal consolidates more than 100 surface transportation programs into 10. This simplification eliminates duplicative work and clarifies the goals of each program. If implemented next year, the BPC proposal would align spending better with existing revenue, which today is about $40 billion a year, $14 billion less than is being spent on existing programs. The plan would allow more money to pour into much-needed transportation programs as funds become available.\The BPC believes the House would do well to adopt the current Senate plan, and could do better by improving on that bill with our bipartisan strategy. The worst result of the current debate would be to cut transportation funding without reforming the programs.\We recognize that asking Congress to vote for a transportation program that would cut funding and shift spending, perhaps away from their own states and favored projects, is not simple. The historic popularity of the surface transportation bill has come directly from the fact that it was concrete evidence of a lawmaker's ability to bring home federal dollars.\However, if our elected leaders want to show their constituents that they hold the national good over their parochial or partisan interests, working across party lines to reform the federal highway program would be a good place to start.\Jason Grumet is founder and president of the Bipartisan Policy Center.

209," New Eldorado facility draws increasing number of elders,\ but volunteers hoping for more growth wonder about future funding\ Center: Patrons range in age from 60 to 94\ After 62 years of marriage, there was still something Kay Woodall didn't know about her husband, Cecil, or about her daughter Belinda Munro.\ As Kay Woodall settled into an armchair in front of a fireplace to read a book after lunch\ Wednesday, her husband and daughter played a casual game of eight ball in the next room.\ ""I didn't know she even played. I didn't know Cecil liked it that much,"" Kay Woodall said.\ Getting together three times a week for lunch at the Ken and Patty Adam Senior Center, some elderly residents of the Eldorado area are getting to know their neighbors -- and their loved ones -- a little better.\ The Woodalls were among 35 area seniors who showed up Wednesday for lunch at the new senior center. Volunteer Janet Amtmann said it was among the smallest crowds at lunch so far this year.\ After volunteers and a staff cook started serving lunch three days a week in December, interest in the noon meal in Eldorado has soared. The newly built senior center has since hosted a near- capacity crowd of 56 lunch guests, and routinely serves more than 40.\ ""We certainly have the capacity for the kitchen to do more,"" Amtmann said.\ The kitchen also has capacity to prepare meals for dozens of area senior citizens unable to leave their homes, but volunteers who manage the senior center have no way to deliver meals unless they do it themselves.\ In a political environment where unbudgeted spending is often the norm, Eldorado seniors didn't wait for city, county or state agencies that serve the elderly to budget money for senior services in Eldorado. Retirees contacted county commissioners and state legislators and asked for money. Eventually, they got what they wanted.\ The senior center at 16 Avenida Torreon opened one day a week in April 2007, serving meals delivered from a city of Santa Fe kitchen that prepares meals for seniors. In December, the county hired a part-time chef, Robert Lujan, to work five days a week preparing meals for lunches at the new Eldorado senior center. In addition to the three weekly sit-down meals, he also prepares 11 carryout lunches that volunteers deliver to Eldorado residents each weekday.\ With more volunteers to make deliveries, the kitchen could prepare meals for seniors living in Lamy, Galisteo, Glorieta and Canada de Los Alamos, Amtmann said. Or, the city and county could provide a van with state funds earmarked a few years ago for such projects, Amtmann said.\ A core group of volunteers has championed the project so far, piloting funding proposals through state and county processes, helping develop building plans and arranging programs for seniors, but the center is open to the public only three days a week. Future funding is uncertain, Amtmann said.\ Area seniors had little difficulty convincing local elected officials to support their project. During recent capital-outlay scrambles, area legislators earmarked oil-and-gas-tax money to build the center.\ Senior center volunteers have had a more difficult time persuading administrative agencies to include the Eldorado facility in annual budgets. The county provided money to hire a cook for six months, but the county pays the city to operate other county senior centers. Amtmann said county staff told volunteers they will need to show the senior center is meeting local needs to receive funding after six months.\ ""We've got a few things to work out with them. When it was built it was built under the assumption the city would operate it as well,"" said Steve Shepherd, county Health and Human Services Division Director.\ The county wants to continue paying a cook's wages, but the future of funds available to the county is uncertain, Shepherd said. Plans have Lujan going from temporary status to ""term"" status after his first six months. Term employees' jobs are contingent on the terms of available funding, Shepherd said.\ The van Eldorado volunteers want could soon arrive, too, Shepherd said. Because money for the van flowed from the Legislature through the city to the county, which must own and operate it as public property, negotiating the deal has involved interagency dialogue that just takes some time, Shepherd said.\ Amtmann is also looking for volunteers to help open the senior center, set up for meals and clean up afterward on a regular basis.\ ""We're just afraid we'll have 90 people show up"" for lunch, Amtmann said.\ The senior citizens who lounge and lunch at the new center range in age from\ 60 years to 94 years, Amtmann said. Some families, like the Woodalls, include two generations of senior citizens.\ ""We have several people who are living with their kids, so they drop them off at 10 a.m. and pick them up at 2 p.m.,"" she said.\ Volunteering at the center is also a family affair for Amtmann and her husband. Janet Amtmann handles much of the day-to-day administrative work, and ""I do the honey-do's"" said her husband, Jrgen Amtmann.\ Contact David Collins\ at 986-3064 or dcollins@sfnewmexican.com."
210,"Senate Democrats said Tuesday that New Mexico's future looks bright -- partly because it doesn't include outgoing Republican Gov. Susana Martinez, who also struck a combative tone at the start of the 30-day legislative session. \""There's a new day on the horizon for the state of New Mexico,"" said Sen. Howie Morales, D-Silver City, who delivered the response from his caucus to Martinez's final State of the State address. \""Soon, we will have a new leadership team that will guide the state in providing more jobs, better classrooms, protection for our environment [and] safer places for our communities to raise our families and lead prosperous lives,"" he said. ""New Mexico has been on too many of the lists, at the bottom, for far too long."" \In her speech, Martinez, who leaves office at the end of this year, focused on issues she has been working on since she was first elected governor in 2010. These included longer criminal sentences and mandatory retention of hundreds or even thousands of third-graders who are not proficient on standardized reading tests. \But Democrats indicated they were ready to move on. \""I'm confident that there's a brighter future for the people of our state, and change is just around the corner,"" said Morales, who was flanked by Democratic leaders, including newly elected Senate Majority Whip Mimi Stewart of Albuquerque. ""But the secret to change is to focus all of our energy not on fighting the old but on creating the new."" \Morales, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor, said priorities Democrats intend to address during the session include early childhood programs, education, public safety, and the health and welfare of all New Mexicans. \""Our focus is clear,"" he said. \Morales said Democrats will propose a 1.5 percent across-the-board pay increase for all public school teachers and state employees. Martinez's proposed budget calls for a 1 percent pay increase for state employees and 2 percent for teachers. \""I hope that this sends a clear message to our educators and state workers: We value your contributions and thank you for the service to our state,"" he said. \Morales said Democrats will consider new laws that carry penalties, but he criticized Martinez, a former prosecutor, for having a myopic focus on crime over the past seven years. \""Public safety is a critical issue for us Democrats, but we have a very different view than the governor,"" he said. ""While she solely focuses on punishment and prosecution, we believe that it's just as important to have prevention and rehabilitation as part of that equation. This will go further in breaking the cycle that has unfortunately left New Mexico as one of the most crime-ridden states in this nation."" \Bail reform appears to be another issue of contention between the governor and Democrats. \Martinez criticized a constitutional amendment on bail approved by voters in 2016, that she said certain judges have turned into a catch-and-release program for criminals. \""We have no intention to do any repealing or replacing,"" Morales said. ""The measure was supported by 87 percent of voters -- and by the governor, once upon a time."" \Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth, D-Santa Fe, said it's clear that ""some tweaks"" are needed. \""This bail reform, our chief justice who's in the same party as Governor Martinez, has called the most significant criminal justice reform since statehood, so the idea that we would repeal that, I think it's completely off the table,"" Wirth said. \Martinez cannot get a new measure on bail procedures on the ballot unless both the Senate and House of Representatives approve it. Both chambers are controlled by Democrats. \What isn't off the table for Democrats are tax proposals, which Martinez has vehemently opposed during her time in office. \Morales said he plans to propose a tobacco tax that would generate $89 million for schools, and he said there will probably be other tax proposals, too. \""I'm not aware right off hand on which ones those might be,"" he said. ""I know the gas tax is often discussed as well."" \But Democrats' first order of business will be to approve a new nurse licensing compact that allows nurses licensed in other states to work in New Mexico without getting a separate certificate. \""All of our communities, especially in the rural areas, depend on these nurses,"" Morales said. ""The impact that would take place if this doesn't happen would be devastating. So what we're looking forward to this week, starting today, is to have legislation in place that would grandfather us in with this nurse licensure compact."" \The measure for nursing licenses could sail through the Legislature as soon as Thursday. \Morales said lawmakers will then move into the multibillion-dollar budget. Morales said lawmakers will begin the process of ""rebuilding and restoring critical areas"" that have been accustomed to cuts. \""Last year at this time, we spent weeks debating how we were going to address the issue of a shortfall,"" he said. ""We had to make difficult decisions, and devastating cuts had to be made just to keep the lights on. We also had to endure some of the changes that occurred through line-item vetoes that were unnecessary by the governor."" \Contact Daniel J. Chacon at 505-986-3089 or dchacon@sfnewmexican.com.

During my years working in the Santa Fe Public Schools, I met an outstanding elementary school teacher named Valdez Abeyta y Valdez who had a drumming program that involved hundreds of students. She started with plastic chairs for drums, but eventually parents purchased the real thing and her students were invited to perform for the New Mexico Governor's Conference.

Look at our state-elected senators.\Paul Moore\Santa Fe\Male aggression\A very small percentage of guns in the U.S. are used to kill people. Overwhelmingly, a very large percentage of the people who kill people are males. Males are largely responsible for the epidemic of violence that afflicts our country. Killing, raping, physical and mental abuse -- males are doing these terrible things. Why is this?\We don't just have a gun problem or a mental illness problem in this country, or throughout the world. We have a male aggression problem. It is arguably the No. 1 root cause of violence. This fact needs to be publicly acknowledged. Just look at the reporting in this paper -- murder, rape, road rage, theft, battery, assault committed by, let's see, oh yes, males.\Male violence is a problem, and it must be named in order to solve it. Leaders, law enforcement, psychiatrists, educators and religious institutions need to step up and coordinate how to address this problem. Our welfare, indeed our very lives, depend upon this happening.\Lyn Parker\Santa Fe"
212," Gov. Gary Johnson rode into Santa Fe on a wave of popularity based in part on his promise to repeal the six-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax increase of 1993. Several bills to repeal the six-cent tax have been introduced to make good on the governor's campaign pledge, and, according to one seasoned representative, the repeal of the gas tax is a stampede that the legislators must run with or be run over.\ However, as Oscar Wilde observed, ""The truth, my dear, is rarely pure and never simple."" The truth, in this case, is that only half of the six-cent tax is there to repeal. Two cents of it has been almost fully obligated to local governments, and one cent has been ""bonded out"" for roads projects. This leaves the two cents that were already suspended, and an additional penny that has gone to the general fund, susceptible to repeal.\ Consequently, our representatives at the Roundhouse are on the prowl for other taxes that can round out the six cents they are supposed to repeal. Ready at hand is the penny-per-gallon loading fee on gasoline, which has been characterized as ""a relief act for petroleum marketers."" On the first day of the session, Sen. Ann Riley, D-Albuquerque, submitted a bill to repeal the one-cent loading fee. Don't do it! This would undermine one of the most effective environmental protection programs in the state.\ The one-cent fee in question is used to feed the Corrective Action Fund under the Ground Water Protection Act -- an act which was put in place, incidentally, largely through the efforts of then-Sen. (now lieutenant governor) Walter Bradley. This fund is used to reimburse the costs of investigation and cleanup of gasoline contamination of soil and water that has resulted from leakage from underground storage tanks.\ Leaking fuel tanks are the leading source of ground water contamination in New Mexico, as well as the nation as a whole. This situation is a result, not of widespread negligence on the part of petroleum suppliers, but rather of casual record keeping and a genuine innocence regarding tank technology and the environmental impacts of leaked fuel. A small leak -- on the order of a couple of gallons per day -- could easily be dismissed as measurement error, spillage at the pump, or small-scale pilferage not worth tracking down.\ Now we are discovering that the effect of that slow leak over the years can be contamination of drinking water supplies that may cost tens of thousands of dollars to investigate and hundreds of thousands of dollars to clean up. Benzene, one of the major constituents of gasoline, spreads rapidly in ground water and is highly carcinogenic: state health standards limit the benzene level in water to one-tenth of one part per million. And, nine out of ten New Mexicans get their drinking water for wells.\ The Corrective Action Fund is only available to responsible parties who are in substantial compliance with the requirements of the Underground Storage Tank regulations, especially as regards prevention and monitoring to reduce the chance of any future leakage going undetected. In fact, a small and chronically underfunded municipality with a fuel leak at its airport was denied access to the fund due to its inadvertent failure to comply with a regulatory deadline to install leak detection equipment. No quarter was shown in this hard-luck case, in order to stress the Environment Department's insistence that all possible measures be taken to prevent any further environmental damage from gasoline leaks.\ The existence of the Corrective Action Fund has therefore been a powerful incentive for owners and operators of underground fuel storage tanks to comply with all of the belt-and-suspender regulations concerning self-reporting, upgrading facilities to decrease the likelihood of a leak, and monitoring to detect leakage - - none of which is subject to reimbursement under the fund. (A full upgrade of a typical service station can run to tens of thousands of dollars.) These prevention-side regulations have been highly effective at reducing the incidence of new leaks. Most of the expenditures under the Corrective Action Fund are for investigation and cleanup of leaks that originated before the regulations on tank standards and monitoring took effect.\ What if the Corrective Action Fund were scuttled? The operators would be forced to purchase environmental insurance, and pass that very high cost along to the consumer in a much less controlled way than the across-the-board penny-a-gallon fee of the Corrective Action Fund. Alternatively, the operators could choose simply to declare bankruptcy if there should be a significant contamination problem at their facility, leaving the problem in the state's lap. The state already has a number of these orphan ""LUST"" sites on their hands, abandoned by operators who could not meet the substantial compliance standard to qualify for reimbursement under the Corrective Action Fund. They have been addressed partially through the ""LUST Trust Fund,"" which is supported by EPA, and partially out of the Corrective Action Fund. The EPA contribution has been declining over the years, and may well dry up altogether, given the current budget-cutting mood in Washington -- so we can't go there for a bail-out.\ Under the present system, the demand for the Corrective Action Fund will taper off over time because most of the investigation and reclamation work on underground storage tank sites will have been completed. At that point, it may be logical for the state to reduce or eliminate the tax that serves the fund. Until then, let all of us who use petroleum-based transport continue to contribute to the fund that helps to prevent further contamination of soil and water by petroleum-based fuels, and pays for the investigation and cleanup of those problems that began before we knew better.\ So, where can our representatives find a tax to repeal on our behalf? Maybe this isn't the year to be writing legislation with a hatchet. Maybe, with federal funding to states being axed in Washington, it isn't such a bad idea to have a surplus in the state's general fund to cover essential programs that once were funded by the feds. Maybe, before we buy our shoes a size smaller, we need to be sure we can walk in them.\ Paige Morgan, with Souder, Miller and Associates of Santa Fe, co- authored a 1992 water report, ""Living Within Our Means."""
213,"WASHINGTON -- A political battle brewing in Congress could cast clouds over New Mexico's growing solar energy industry. \Solar executives and congressional leaders said that unless a federal solar energy tax credit set to expire Dec. 31 is renewed soon, New Mexico -- and the nation -- will start to see a slide in solar investment and job creation. \""This is a big thing, not just for New Mexico but for the country,"" said Sen. Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \""If we are going to become a significant player in solar development and use, we are going to have to have a more stable tax policy,"" Bingaman said. \The tax incentive, a 30 percent credit on the value of residential or commercial solar power investment, aims to spur development of solar energy -- the fastest-growing power source in the world. \If the 30 percent tax credit isn't renewed, it will drop to 10 percent and financial analysts predict solar investment will slow to a crawl. \""It's critically important to the growth of the solar industry,"" said Nancy Pfund, managing partner with California-based DBL Investors. ""Investors need predictability. Without it, something positive and strong for our country will begin to unravel."" \Last month, Germany-based Schott Solar broke ground on a 200,000-square-foot solar energy production plant at Mesa del Sol in Albuquerque, with the promise of 350 new jobs coming from the first phase of development. \But if the incentives expire, a planned expansion that could bring the job count to 1,500 is probably off the table, a Schott official told the Journal. \""We're still committed to building the plant, but if it (the investment tax credit) is not extended, we won't build as much as planned,"" said Alex Marker. ""It would delay our growth."" \Officials with SkyFuel, a solar development firm that opened headquarters in Albuquerque last year, also cited the tax credit as integral to its growth, and to the industry. \""We need to give it a little (tax) break to show that it works and to let people know solar isn't some pie in the sky,"" said Chris Huntington, the company's co-founder. \New Mexico has more sunshine than any other state in the country except for Arizona. \""The Southwest is the Saudi Arabia of solar power,"" Huntington said. ""It's the perfect setup for harnessing the sun."" \But Senate Republicans and Democrats, almost all of whom say they support extending the solar tax credit, haven't been able to agree on how to pay for it. \Most Democrats, including Bingaman, contend that Congress should rescind $18 billion in annual federal subsidies given to the biggest oil and gas companies since 2006 and redirect them to the solar industry. \""This is not a tax benefit they had before -- they were doing fine before and they are doing fine now,"" Bingaman said, referring to record profit margins that oil and gas companies have posted in recent years. ""I don't think this is a major setback for oil and gas companies given the profits they have had."" \The U.S. House approved the tax shift in February. \But Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the top Republican on the Senate energy committee, said he won't support it. \Domenici, who is retiring from Congress after his term ends in January, said the solar tax credit extension doesn't need to be paid for. \""We know it will work and will yield benefits to the American economy, so I would vote for it without the offsets,"" Domenici said, referring to proposals to ""offset"" the breaks given to solar companies by eliminating some tax breaks for oil companies. \""I think they're so important they should be adopted without offsets,"" Domenici said. \Domenici said he supports a new, bipartisan bill introduced in the Senate on Thursday that would extend solar and other renewable energy tax incentives without making up the revenue loss somewhere else in the budget. \Bingaman stopped short of opposing the new bill Thursday but said in a statement he would ""strongly prefer that we find a way to pay for these extensions."" Domenici contends that oil and gas companies are plowing their profits back into production technologies, and that taking away their incentives could slow much-needed \oil production. \""I don't like taking money away from one industry that is doing a good job producing energy for the country and giving it to someone else,"" Domenici said. ""It doesn't matter if it's big oil or whoever."" \John Stanton, vice president of government affairs for the Solar Energy Industry Association, said the industry hopes to prevent a prolonged political squabble over where the money comes from. \""This is creating an extremely poisonous political environment where all of a sudden all of the Republicans who support renewable energy and solar are joining against our tax credits,"" he said. ""This is politicizing the issue in a way that is preventing us from making progress."" \Bob Gallagher, president of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, said rescinding oil and gas tax breaks -- or raising taxes, as industry officials characterize it -- is bad policy. \""Adding taxes to an industry to pay for another is a terrible mistake,"" Gallagher said. \Gallagher conceded that high gas prices and record oil company profits have turned the industry into a ""villain"" in the public's eye. But he urged people to remember that oil and gas are what power their cars and heat their homes. \Solar energy, while promising in the long term, accounts for only about 0.01 percent of the country's electrical energy supply. \""Where are we going to get the energy that we are sucking up every day?"" he asked. \Bingaman said he is open to considering other ways to pay for the solar incentives. But he doesn't think their cost should be added to the deficit. \""If they have another way to get this paid for, I'm certainly open to considering that,"" Bingaman said. \Stanton and others in the solar energy industry said investors want assurances that the federal government is committed to helping develop the energy source over the long term. They have asked Congress to extend the tax credit for eight years. \""You need a long-term extension,"" Stanton said. ""People won't invest billions of dollars in manufacturing facilities if they think the well is going to run dry."" \Domenici, who chaired the energy committee before Bingaman, said a four-year extension would find more support in Congress. \""Eight years is very long when you consider there can be breakthroughs in that period that would make these things doable without heavy subsidies,"" he said. ""Maybe four years for starters would be a good way to help."" \Huntington, of Albuquerque-based SkyFuel, said the time frame may be negotiable, but the need for some kind of extension should not be. \""Congress needs to get a sense of urgency, put politics aside and put policy first,"" Huntington said."
214,"As a young man, Terry Marquardt began preparing for his future. He studied pre-med at the University of New Mexico, then earned his doctorate at the Southern College of Optometry. Post-doctoral and specialization training followed, and Marquardt completed board certification as a Diplomate, America Board of Optometry, specializing in glaucoma and contact lenses.\Yet it was from his father, Dr. Oscar Marquardt (an optometrist as well), that Terry Marquardt learned something even more important about life: get involved in your community, and give back.\""My dad was a civic leader,"" Marquardt said. ""He helped to start the Boys and Girls Club in Alamogordo, and served as president of the local Parent Teacher Association. He was a founder of the first Lutheran Church here. He coached Little League and American Legion Baseball, and his teams won state championships.""\For many sons, that would be a tough act to follow. For Marquardt, however, Dad was an example to which to live up. When he retired in late 2020, Marquardt left his own decades'-long legacy of compassion and altruism, all the way from the streets of Alamogordo to the halls of Santa Fe's Roundhouse.\The list of organizations Marquardt felt worthwhile to lend his time, talents, and energy is a long one. Included are the Chamber of Commerce, the Downtown Merchants Association, the Alamogordo Food Bank, United Way, Noon Lions, Rotary, and Gideons International. He was Alamogordo Main Street's first president. He coached Boys Club basketball, Little League and Babe Ruth baseball, as well as swim teams. He was congregational president and elder at Shepherd of the Hills Lutheran Church, and taught Sunday school and confirmation classes.\Professionally, Marquardt served for five years on the New Mexico State Board of Optometry, and was a clinical investigator for the FDA for extended wear contact lenses. He was subnormal vision specialist for the New Mexico School for the Blind and Visually Impaired, and sports vision consultant to Alamogordo High School athletics. He became adjunct professor for Northeastern State University's College of Optometry, served on the NM Optometric Association board – which, in 2005, named him Optometrist of the Year – and was president of the NM State Board of Examiners. The same year, Vision Service Plan awarded him the ""People First"" award.\""The Bible teaches us to 'love our neighbor,'"" Marquardt said in accepting the award, ""'and Ghandi taught us to 'let the change you want to see in the world, begin with you.' By placing people first, we make the world a better place to live.""\Marquardt's accomplishments didn't go unnoticed. Before long, he was named as an ""Outstanding Young Man in America,"" and to ""Who's Who in the West.""\Alamogordo High School graduated Marquardt in 1967. While there he was active in baseball, worked as a lifeguard, and played in the Tiger band. He never has set down his instrument. Marquardt's musical ability has seen him wailing on his saxophone on stages around Alamogordo, at UNM, and with New Mexico State University-Alamogordo's Jazz Band. It even took him to New York City to belt out rock-'n'-roll with EyeRock, at the Hard Rock Cafe.\Off to Santa Fe\In late 1993, Marquardt set his sights on becoming a state representative. A conservative, he had several goals in wanting to serve District 53. They included addressing excessive taxation.\""The six-cent per gallon gas tax was irresponsible legislation,"" he said of the increase that had occurred not long before he announced his political aspirations. ""The families of New Mexico should never have been burdened with this unnecessary tax.""\Marquardt felt New Mexico could better use the state's abundant natural resources, improve public education and healthcare, and be more financially accountable.\""That's the platform I ran on,"" he said.\As a medical professional – and maybe even more importantly a hometown boy who was doing well in life – Marquardt interacted with hundreds of people. They were his patients, his friends. It's no surprise they often expressed to him their dissatisfaction with government.\On election day in 1994 Marquardt won, besting the popular incumbent by 1,213 votes. In Santa Fe he soon found himself on such powerful committees as Business and Industry, Appropriations and Finance, Health and Human Services, Science and Technology, Public Utility Regulation, Judiciary, Welfare Reform, Legislative Council, and Education Funding. Over the next 12 years he set about accomplishing what he'd promised.\Marquardt sponsored bills that addressed crime.\""We have tolerated, for a generation, a level of crime and drugs that is insane,"" he said. ""You break the back of crime by repressing it. You say to people when they are very young, 'If you break the law, you will not be back on the street while you are still young.'""\He tackled education, healthcare, water, energy, teen pregnancies, juvenile justice reform, and Spaceport America. His educational appropriations ran the spectrum of need: building new classrooms at NMSU-A, including $2.5 million for a new Nursing School with state-of-the-art technology, and $1.5 million to house the basic sciences classrooms; creating a Department of Aerospace Engineering at NMSU-Las Cruces; and training those on welfare for jobs so they could become productive and take pride in their homes and community.\Marquardt worked to get a million dollars for the Flickinger Center for Performing Arts, as well as capital outlay for the Alamogordo Public Library, the AHS tennis and soccer complexes, and for new bleachers in the Tiger Pit gymnasium.\He succeeded in acquiring funds to upgrade U.S. 54 and 70 from two to four lanes (both were notorious for vehicle accidents), and for the U.S. 54/70/82 Relief Route around Alamogordo.\For energy, in 2001 Marquardt learned of massive deposits of natural gas underneath southern Otero County, near El Paso, in a wilderness area known as Otero Mesa. He proposed the state build a gas-fired, electric-generating plant.\""We could provide reasonably priced electricity to Otero County residents,"" he said at the time.\So passionate was Marquardt about the future possibilities that he took his idea to the White House to discuss with President George W. Bush. He sat down with the New Mexico congressional delegation: Senators Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman, and U.S. Representatives Joe Skeen and Heather Wilson. He stressed drilling could be accomplished without harm to the environment. He did not, however, have the support of then-Gov. Bill Richardson. Environmentalists lobbied against him, and Marquardt's plan and hopes stalled.\Marquardt sponsored desalination legislation that was successful in bringing home monies to address projects turning unusable briny water to potable water.\Under the Tularosa Basin there's an ocean of salt water, 300 million acre feet, 426 trillion gallons, of salt water,"" Marquardt said. ""That's enough water to supply the water needs of a population of 250,000 people for a thousand years.\For his efforts, a fellow lawmaker, a Native American, nicknamed Marquardt ""Wa Na Q Khea,"" which translates, ""Water Maker.""\""Water promises to be, in the 21st century, what oil was in the 20th century,"" Marquardt said. ""It's the precious commodity that determines the wealth of nations.""\Once again his accomplishments were recognized, this time by the American Legislative Exchange Council. ALEC, the nation's largest bipartisan association of state legislators, named Marquardt the state chair, as well as Legislator of the Year from among 2,400 candidates nationwide.\In 2004 the National Republican Congressional Committee honored Marquardt with the Ronald Reagan Republican Gold Medal Award. He was added to ""Who's Who in American Politics."" The Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce, in 1999, gave him their prestigious ""Legislative Leader Award."" The New Mexico District Attorneys' Association selected him in 2005 as ""Outstanding Legislator"" for his ""strong commitment to criminal justice issues and criminal justice agencies.""\Marquardt's peers in the House also voted him into the enviable leadership positions of minority whip and minority caucus chair. By then he'd become known for somewhat of a different kind of whip: whipping his fellow House lawmakers, no matter their side of the aisle, onto a basketball court for an annual game that raised thousands of dollars for charitable causes.\End of an Era\During his dozen years in Santa Fe, Rep. Terry Marquardt paid attention to every community, no matter the size, in his District 53. Even rural newspaper columnist Oza Holcomb lauded him in her syndicated column, ""Pinon News,"" for getting $100,000 to repair the Pinon Water Users Association lines, and $150,000 to overhaul roads in Timberon.\""Oza Holcomb wishes to represent the Pinon people in their appreciation and thanks for his work for the Pinon people's water Line,"" she wrote. ""It has been reported that Mr. Marquardt worked very hard for the Pinon and Timberon people in these troubles.""\For many years there was a standing, oft-recited mantra in southern New Mexico that politicians in Santa Fe only cared about the territory north of I-40 in Albuquerque.\""We made them very aware that we are here in southern New Mexico,"" Marquardt said of his efforts. He pointed out the coordination among his fellow Otero County Republican legislators, which he said put the lower half of the state back on the map.\Eventually the funding he allocated, or passed in conjunction with his peers to bring home, reached into the hundreds of millions of dollars.\When Dr. Terry Marquardt retired in late 2020 from his medical office in a historic building at New York Avenue and Ninth Street, he had a lot of memories to take off the walls.

Thank you certificates from those who appreciated what Marquardt had done for them, their families, and their organizations both politically and medically.\During his dozen years in Santa Fe, Marquardt walked the marbled halls where so many famous names and faces had gone before him. He'd gotten there because those to whom he'd generously given his time and talents in Alamogordo and Otero County appreciated him for treating them just as importantly as those he'd rubbed shoulders with in the state and nation's capitols.\It wasn't that hard, actually. Marquardt's philosophy was really nothing more than what he'd learned from watching his dad walk the walk.\Dr. Terry Marquardt retired from his optometry practice in late 2020.\Courtesy photos/ Michael Shinabery\Marquardt played saxophone in the Alamogordo High School Tiger Band.

215," Gov. Gary Johnson establishes wish list for prisons, education, Medicaid but faces an obstacle to his goals -- the Legislature\ SANTA FE -- Gov. Gary Johnson, at the midpoint of his four-year term, is a man with big plans but few expectations.\ In a wide-ranging interview earlier this month, Johnson elaborated on the state's need for new prisons -- his No. 1 priority. And he ticked off a host of needs and goals he sees for the state.\ More and better roads are needed. Welfare rolls need to be trimmed, and millions of dollars need to be sliced out of the $1 billion Medicaid budget.\ Public schools and universities need to be made accountable for the quality of education they deliver, and they need to make better use of their money.\ Hard-working citizens need to have the burden of taxes and big government lifted off their shoulders.\ But to make it all happen, Johnson will need the help of the Legislature, which so far has shown little inclination to do so.\ ""The Legislature is today no more willing to interact with me than they were the first day I came up here,"" Johnson says.\ To make his agenda reality, the governor says, ""I continue to do everything I can every day.""\ That agenda is growing.\ Prison expansion\ Johnson is quick to say building new prisons is his top priority.\ ""We need to build the prisons,"" he says. ""I believe that that's going to reduce crime. I believe that by having 2,000 fewer criminals on the streets, that is going to reduce crime.""\ Johnson's prison-building efforts for the past two years have stalled.\ A compromise announced this fall with legislative leaders has been blocked by a lawsuit from two state representatives who claim the prison financing scheme could jeopardize the state's credit.\ Two new prisons, one in Hobbs with about 1,200 beds and another in Santa Rosa with 800 beds, would be financed, designed and built with tax-free bonds issued through the local communities to a newly created nonprofit corporation that would own the prisons.\ The nonprofit corporation would contract with private companies to operate the prisons, and the state would contract with the private companies to house the prisoners.\ Johnson says the arrangement wouldn't be risky.\ ""I believe that the Legislature, in an afternoon, could adopt a method of financing that would be acceptable to everyone. And I wish they would do that.""\ Johnson is frustrated with the reluctance of the Legislature to help him.\ ""You go back to the first year that the prisons were passed,"" he says. ""They gave (us) $16 million to apply toward the construction of the prison the first year. Then last year, (the Legislature said) go down this route with regard to financing and we'll take back the $16 million. Fine. That's what we did.\ ""There is a two-way street here and I suggest to you that I've been on the cooperative side at every turn to try and make this happen,"" Johnson says.\ ""I gave back the $16 million so they could spend it on God knows what, and if I'd have thought they weren't good by their word, I'd have kept that $16 million and asked for another $16 million to start piling up money to apply toward the construction of these projects. I certainly wouldn't have parted with the $16 million.""\ Johnson downplays worries about prisons not being owned by the state at the end of a proposed 20-year lease.\ ""The effect of it all, the reality of it is, yes, the state owns them as they are,"" after the 20 years, Johnson says. ""On paper, no, that isn't the case. That there is fear over the fact the state doesn't own the prisons? They're prisons. What else are they going to be used for?""\ More prison cells will allow the state to better manage prisoners, he says.\ ""One of the strategies of corrections is simply that when you've got bad characters, that you can take and separate those characters by locking them up in their own separate cells away from the situation (where) they're causing trouble. We don't have that luxury. It doesn't exist.""\ Johnson says the logic of letting private companies finance and build new prisons is clear.\ ""The road we went down didn't require the state of New Mexico to pay one nickel until we moved in,"" Johnson says.\ Reforming good time\ Johnson recently has been criticized for creating the prison overcrowding by not letting more prisoners out on early-release programs.\ Also Johnson has been criticized for his veto of a bill that apparently would have restricted the use of good time, which now allows a prisoner to knock one day off his sentence for every day of good behavior.\ But Johnson says state law already gives the administration flexibility to handle good time.\ ""It is our belief that we can do that administratively,"" he says of reducing good time. ""Given the law that is on the books, prisons may, the statute reads may, be granted up to one day for one day (of good behavior)."" Instead this policy has been looked at as if it were a law, he says.\ Johnson vetoed the last good time bill that reached his desk because he believed it fell far short of reforming good time policy.\ ""I suggest that it wouldn't have reduced good time at all.""\ Johnson says he still hopes to see a revision in good time.\ ""If a bill came up before me tomorrow that really reduced good time, I would sign it.""\ But changing good time makes little sense without more prison space, he says.\ ""It's really kind of a moot point because we could do it anyway, and all of it is a moot point because if you don't have room to put (prisoners), how do you address good time?""\ 'Give me the sword'\ Public education is a system that demands increasing amounts of public money, he says, but lacks accountability.\ ""I seem to be judged only by how much money I put into education,"" Johnson says. If he is going to be held responsible for education funding, he also wants some authority over it.\ ""I have no say whatsoever in education,"" Johnson says, except that, ""I appoint five individuals to the state school board.""\ His recent suggestion for extensive testing of students has been ignored, the governor says.\ ""I've asked that we test every student, every school, every year, every grade. I've not really gotten a response on that,"" he says. ""I've just gotten lip service on what I consider to be a significant request, what I believe would actually have long-range positive impact on education, perhaps more than any other single item. I can't get a response to it.""\ If given more control over the public schools, he would use it.\ ""I'd like to appoint the state school board, which would ultimately give me the appointive power over the state school superintendent. Or I'd like to abolish the state school board and make the state school superintendent a Cabinet secretary so at least I would be accountable, not just held accountable.\ ""Live and die by the sword, give me the sword.""\ Part of Johnson's frustration with public education stems from his personal experiences as general contractor when he was once asked to bid on a repair project at Albuquerque's Hoover Middle School.\ The Albuquerque schools had assembled its own roofing crew, he says, that went from school to school. When re-roofing Hoover, the crew ripped up all the wiring and heating, ventilation and air conditioning on the roof, crushed it and left it in piles.\ He was asked to bid on repair of all the damage that had been done.\ ""I have never seen anything so atrocious in my entire life,"" Johnson says. ""Here was a half a million bucks of damage with no accountability whatsoever. And APS had the pockets to pay this. That's just one small experience. But who's accountable for that? I'm sure not.""\ If given the power over public education, Johnson says he could make it more efficient and perhaps less costly.\ ""If we could get rid of the worst teachers that we have, we'd be able to reward the better teachers we have"" he says. ""And if we didn't have all the bad teachers we have, we wouldn't need to have so many administrators looking after all the bad teachers.""\ Johnson said he was shocked to learn that Sandia High School, which he attended, now has eight assistant principals. He said it had only one when he attended.\ (Rick Murray, spokesman for the Albuquerque Public Schools, says Sandia High School has three assistant principals.)\ ""I heard a statistic the other day. Is this true? I understand there are more administrative employees with Albuquerque Public Schools than there are teachers,"" Johnson says.\ ""If that's the case, I'd love to be in the middle of that trying to correct that problem. But I'm not in the middle of it. I'm held accountable for that, but I have absolutely no say in it whatsoever.""\ (Murray says Johnson is ""way off."" The district has 10,500 employees, and 8,444 are principals, teachers, custodians, librarians, counselors and other ""school-based"" personnel. That includes 118 principals and 76 assistant principals. About half of the remaining 2,000 could be considered administrators.)\ Paving the way to growth\ The biggest boost to the state's economy could come from a tax cut, but, ""that's not going to happen under the current environment,"" Johnson says.\ More and better highways is the next best thing to boost growth, Johnson says.\ ""I looked at an overlay of a map the other day that showed the greatest area of economic growth in New Mexico,"" Johnson says. ""I looked at the map first with the economic growth shown and then they overlaid a map that showed where the four-lane highways were in New Mexico. And, incredibly, the economic growth occurs along the corridors of four-lane highways.\ ""I believe that by four-laning (US) 285 and by four-laning (NM) 44, as a starter, that we really impact economic activity. That's it in a nutshell.""\ NM 44 stretches from Bernalillo to just east of Farmington in the northwest and US 285 stretches from Santa Fe south to Carlsbad, passing through Roswell.\ But to do that will require diverting money that now flows into the state's general fund to the state road fund where it can be used to finance bonds for road construction.\ The Legislature didn't adopt the proposal last year, and Peter Rahn, secretary of the state Highway and Transportation Department, says it will be submitted again.\ ""When you fill up for gas, you're paying 17 cents in gas tax, four cents of which are not going to highways. They're going to the general fund,"" Johnson says.\ (The four cents generates about $17 million, which is sent to the to the state Motor Vehicle Division, the state Corporation Commission and the state Tourism Department.)\ Gaming resolution\ Early in his first year, Johnson signed gambling compacts with many of New Mexico's Indian tribes. But the compacts have been ruled illegal, and although Indian casino gambling goes on, its continuation depends on a favorable ruling from a federal appeals court in Denver.\ Or, the state Legislature could act during the coming session to make it legal.\ ""I would like to see gambling resolved,"" Johnson says.\ He has not wavered from his initial position that the Legislature should make legal gambling that existed in the state when he took office. The only expansion would be to extend video gambling to horse racing tracks during their racing seasons.\ ""That would be the position I've held to all along,"" Johnson says. ""Ratify some sort of compact. Regulate Indian gambling. Share in the revenues. Legitimatize fraternal and charitable gambling.""\ New Mexicans expressed their opinion about gambling in 1994 when a constitutional amendment was approved that allowed video gambling in the state, Johnson says. The amendment was overturned by the Supreme Court.\ Welfare, Medicaid\ Johnson and his Human Services Department Secretary Duke Rodriguez are recommending that the state turn over the operation of Medicaid, which pays for health care for the poor, to private companies.\ Rodriguez argues the move will save about $170 million out of the state's $1 billion Medicaid budget, which provides health care for the poor.\ Johnson says he wants to lower the welfare rolls from a high of about 35,000 in 1994, to about 20,000, where they were before 1990.\ ""Forever it has been at 20,000 and then in 1990 it went to 35,000. We actually recruited,"" Johnson says. ""So everything, the whole debate surrounding welfare reform, whether it's time limits (for benefits), it's basically to get the case load back down to where it was.""\ Roundhouse gridlock\ Johnson's relationship, or lack of one, with the state Legislature has created gridlock on major issues such as prison construction and casino gambling.\ But Johnson says he is not to blame.\ ""What does deal mean?"" Johnson asks. ""Does deal mean the Legislature says they're going to do something in return for what I'm going to do? I've been down that course. And, where am I at right now?"" Johnson asks.\ ""Deal implies two parties in good faith somehow coming up with some conclusion. This whole relationship is a two-way street, and somehow I'm being portrayed as the one who's not getting along,"" Johnson says.\ ""Ask me the last time that (House Speaker) Raymond Sanchez has asked me to meet with him or that (Senate President Pro Tem) Manny Aragon has asked me to meet with them that I have not met with them,"" Johnson says.\ ""Never has occurred. Never."""
216," Max Coll, who represented District 47 in the state House of Representatives for more than two decades, threw a monkey wrench into the local Democratic primary election when he announced his retirement in early March -- just a few days before the candidate filing deadline.\ It didn't take long for candidates to start popping up, however, and by filing day several Democrats lined up to take Coll's place: home builder James Garton, City Councilor Carol Robertson Lopez, retired lawyer and businessman Malcom McFarlane and lawyer Peter Wirth.\ Longtime environmental activist Sally Rodgers -- Coll's former wife -- initially filed but in early April dropped out.\ Republican Greg Bemis, who has challenged for Coll's seat before, is unopposed in his party's June 1 primary and in November will face the Democratic survivor.\ House District 47 includes some of the city's most affluent east- side neighborhoods. It contains the Mansion Ridge Road area, the Sol y Lomas area, as well as part of the South Capitol area east of Don Gaspar Avenue and a large south-side area including neighborhoods south of Rodeo Road between St. Francis Drive and Cerrillos Road. It also includes several communities east and southeast of the city, including Eldorado, Canada de los Alamos and the Sunlit Hills/Seton Village/Nine Mile Road areas off Old Las Vegas Highway.\ Here is a look at the Democrats competing for the House seat:\ James Garton\ Like two of his opponents, Garton is a novice at running for elected office. The small business owner said in an interview that he has thought about running for Legislature for a long time but didn't want to run against Coll.\ ""But the fact is, nothing ever changes in New Mexico,"" Garton said. ""I'm tired of New Mexico always being at the bottom of every list.""\ Garton, 50, says his background in civil engineering and business gives him the edge in issues such as water, land use, transportation and the environment.\ Born in New Jersey, Garton spent one year of his childhood in Cimarron, N.M. He moved back to the state in the early 1980s.\ On the topic of water, Garton said he would introduce legislation for state monitoring of domestic wells. The average homeowner wouldn't be affected, he said. But some people with domestic well permits are irrigating pecan orchards, Garton said. ""There's abuse and there's no way to monitor it,"" he said.\ He also would require municipalities to formulate 50-year water plans.\ Garton lists education as a main priority -- partly, he said, because he grew up in a family of teachers. His mother and two sisters have been educators. At a recent forum Garton told how one of his sisters quit a teaching job in western New Mexico to pick up litter at Yellowstone National Park because that job paid better.\ Carol Robertson Lopez\ The 54-year-old Santa Fe city councilor is the only candidate in the Democratic primary race who has run for public office before.\ Recently retired from the state Transportation Department, where she was procurement director, Lopez says she has worked with New Mexico legislators for many years.\ If elected, she intends to keep her council seat. She has two years remaining on her current term representing City Council District 4 in south-central Santa Fe.\ Lopez grew up in Pennsylvania. She lived in Las Cruces in the 1970s, then moved to Santa Fe 27 years ago.\ She is known as a moderate on a left-leaning municipal governing body.\ When running for City Council in the 1990s, Lopez, who had been on the city Planning Commission for several years, was criticized by some for being too ""pro-development.""\ This criticism hasn't completely evaporated, though since being elected she often has sided with neighborhood groups against proposed developments -- especially in her south-side council district.\ In January she was one of three councilors to vote against a plan to build 46 townhouses on property adjacent to the old pumice plant at the intersection of Galisteo and Zia Road.\ She also voted against Sam's Club's original proposal to put gas pumps on its Rodeo Road property, though she later supported a revised plan. The council approved the plan after public outcry over the city preventing the giant discount chain from competing in Santa Fe's pricey gasoline market. The project is now tied up in a court appeal.\ Carter Bundy, political director for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which has endorsed her candidacy, praised Lopez for her support of Santa Fe's municipal minimum-age ordinance -- also currently being challenged in court.\ Malcolm McFarlane\ McFarlane is a gregarious, good-humored man who looks and sounds like a southern lawyer.\ The Georgia native -- who at 49 has retired from the legal profession -- is a reform-minded progressive who doesn't mind verbally stepping on the toes of the powers that be. ""We have a good- old-boy system here as bad as the one I left in Georgia,"" is one of his impressions of local politics since moving to Santa Fe two years ago.\ At a recent candidate forum, McFarlane admitted that he had been arrested on a drunken-driving charge about 10 years ago in Georgia - - though he said the charge was dropped the next day. He said he thought it would be good for all public officials to spend a night in jail to widen their perspectives.\ McFarlane often launches into his thoughts on national as well as local issues.\ A self-described ""peace Democrat,"" McFarlane said he would use his position to register new voters to ""beat George W. Bush.""\ He said he got in the race as a result of his frustration with the local Democratic Party, which ran out of ballots in several polling places during last February's presidential caucus.\ And he has promised that if he doesn't win, he won't run for office again.\ McFarlane has been endorsed by longtime local peace activist and Santa Fe Living Treasure Mary Lou Cook, whom he met in the Dennis Kucinich presidential campaign.\ ""Malcolm is a man of experience, ability, warmth, energy, balance and humor,"" Cook wrote in a letter to local Kucinich supporters. ""He will fight the difficult battles for social justice. He will protect Medicaid. He will support a living wage. ... It is rare when we get a person of this quality who can articulate a progressive, positive message.""\ Peter Wirth\ Wirth is a grandson of the late Santa Fe architect John Gaw Meem - - credited for helping to popularize the Pueblo Revival architectural style now common in the region. He's also the nephew of former U.S. Sen. Tim Wirth, who has been active in several local charitable and civic organizations.\ A trial lawyer with the firm of Sawtell, Wirth and Biedscheid, his practice focuses on real estate, probate and wills, and mediation.\ At the age of 42, he's the youngest of the four candidates. But several weeks into the race some consider him the candidate to beat.\ Wirth received the blessing of Coll, who said, ""When I compared the candidates' positions on education, environmental protection, universal health care, equal rights for individuals and many social issues, Peter Wirth seemed to me to be by far the best qualified.""\ Wirth also has been endorsed by The Sierra Club and New Mexico Progressive Action, a political action committee formed in the early '80s to fight the coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats which had taken power in the Legislature.\ Wirth also took a major lead in fund raising. In the first round of campaign-finance reports last week, Wirth reported raising $59,023 -- well over twice the total that his three primary opponents have raised.\ His success in fundraising has made Wirth a target for other candidates.\ ""It's blue collar vs. blue blood,"" Lopez said when she saw Wirth's contribution totals at the Santa Fe County Clerk's office last week. ""I'm going to keep working. This election is not for sale.""\ Wirth shrugs off such criticism. ""When I got into this, I wasn't that well known, while Carol Robertson Lopez has great name recognition,"" he said. He said his list of contributors include a wide diversity of people.\ As for the ""blue-collar"" jibe, Wirth noted that he has been endorsed by carpenter and pipe- fitter unions. A few days later the local electrician union also endorsed him.\ Similarities and differences\ All four candidates agree on several issues. All would vote to allow the state to buy prescription drugs from Canada for the Medicaid program, all favor abolishing the death penalty, all would vote to allow the use of marijuana for certain medical conditions, to require a deposit on soft drink and beer bottles, and to open up the Legislature's House/Senate conference committees to the public.\ All four would oppose legislation to prohibit same-sex marriages in the state and all four would oppose a bill to require ignition- interlock systems on all vehicles to fight drunken driving.\ There are a few areas in which one candidate breaks away from the pack.\ Garton is the only one who said he'd vote for cutting back on benefits in the state's mushrooming Medicaid program to make up for budget shortfalls. ""New Mexico has one of the most generous benefit programs of any state,"" he said. ""There is money to be saved here without dropping anyone from the program or impacting anyone's health.""\ He also is the only one in this race who said he'd support a bill requiring voters to show identification at the polls. In legislative sessions, Republicans routinely introduced such a bill and Democrats routinely kill it in committee.\ Lopez is the only District 47 contender who said she wouldn't vote to repeal the personal income tax cuts the stated adopted in 2002 for the upper-income brackets.\ ""There is already a trigger mechanism that is a safeguard in the event of some catastrophic revenue shortfall for the state,"" she said. ""The tax cuts are phased in, and full implementation would be delayed in the event of a shortfall.""\ Lopez also is the only candidate who wasn't in opposition to a frequently proposed bill to require doctors notify the parents of minor girls seeking abortions.\ ""As a parent I would want to know if my child were faced with such a serious decision, because I would want to be there to provide support and counsel,"" she said. ""But I'm open to discussion about the drawbacks on such legislation.""\ She's also the only candidate who didn't agree that the governor should have to consult the Legislature on spending federal money -- which was a major source of tension between Gov. Bill Richardson and Coll, who chaired the House Appropriations and Finance Committee.\ ""Not all federal funds, grants and emergency funds need to be approved by the Legislature,"" Lopez said. ""Continuing sources of federal funds are properly appropriated by the Legislature, and the New Mexico courts may well determine the exact circumstances of this.""\ McFarlane is the only candidate opposed to requiring twice- convicted DWI offenders to forfeit their vehicles.\ ""This doesn't solve the problem, since drunks just borrow someone else's car. Let us attack the root of the problem by increasing alcohol tax. Studies prove this reduces the consumption of alcohol, especially by minors, which reduces DWI,"" he said.\ Wirth is the only one of the four opposed to raising gasoline taxes by 5 cents a gallon, an idea some tout as a way to pay off highway bonds sooner.\ Lopez said she'd vote for such a proposal only if it had a requirement for voter referendum. McFarlane said he'd raise the gas tax, but he'd use the revenue to pay for a commuter rail service and alternative-energy development.\ The candidates split over the issue of public financing of legislative candidates' campaigns. McFarlane and Wirth are for the idea, while Garton and Lopez are against it.\ ""As long as energy, insurance, pharmaceutical and alcohol corporations dominate the flow of funds going to candidates, we will get public policies reflecting their interests,"" McFarlane said.\ ""I understand that this might allow more people to participate in the political process, which I favor,"" Garton said. ""However I don't feel New Mexico can afford to do this. I would rather see the money spent on education and perhaps put caps on spending.""\ (Sidebars)\ Primary election\ This is part of a series profiling candidates in June 1 election races in which voters will choose nominees for state and county offices.\ * Today: State House District 47\ * Tuesday: State House District 45\ * Wednesday: State Senate District 25\ * Thursday: County Commission District 2\ * Friday: County Commission District 5\ * Saturday: Santa Fe County clerk\ * May 23: Santa Fe County treasurer\ James Garton\ Age: 50\ Years in Santa Fe: 21\ Education: B.S. in civil engineering from Purdue University; post- graduate work in business law and accounting.\ Occupation: Small-business owner; home designer/builder.\ Political experience: None\ Other experience: Santa Fe Homebuilders Association Board of directors; Chairman of Dos Griegos Architectural Committee; member of American Society of Civil Engineers; 1,000 Friends of New Mexico; National Trust for Historic Preservation; The Trust for Public Land; National Association of Railroad Passengers.\ Personal: Married to Darlene Garton for 17 years; two children, ages 15 and 9.\ Latest book read: No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series.\ Favorite movie: A Beautiful Mind\ Favorite television show: (News and movies)\ Favorite Web site: eBay (""My son and I collect license plates."")\ Last political campaign to which contributed money: N/A\ Have you ever been arrested?: No\ Carol Robertson Lopez\ Age: 54\ Years in Santa Fe: 27\ Education: BA in secondary education and social studies, Edinboro State College; MA in educational management and development, New Mexico State University.\ Occupation: Recently retired as procurement director for state Transportation Department.\ Political experience: Serving second term on City Council, currently mayor pro tem; past member of city Planning Commission and Extraterritorial Zoning Commission; Congressional vice chair of Democratic Party; vice president, state Democratic Women.\ Other experience: Was part of state Transportation Department's legislative team.\ Endorsements: American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees.\ Personal: Married to Jeff Case.

217," The new Public Regulation Commission (PRC) seriously goofed when it suspended the Net Metering Rule enacted by the former Public Utility Commission (PUC).(""First PRC action energizes critics"", New Mexican, January 13.)The hasty PRC action to suspend the rule may have been inadvertent, due to the fact that the commissioners are new to the job, so we'll give them the benefit of the doubt-for the moment.But they need to realize that we're facing a serious energy- related crisis that they and our legislature need to address.\ According to a New Mexican article on January 12, entitled `Researchers split on why '90s are so hot,"" meteorologists meeting in Dallas soberly proclaimed 1998 the hottest year in more than a century and the 1990's as the warmest decade on record.National Climatic Data Center scientist David Easterly sounded the warning, ""when you start looking at some of the unprecedented events that have occurred, 16 months in a row that set a record . . . the evidence is really starting to mount that something is happening.""And he's not alone.Several thousand respected scientists have concluded that continued global warming is at least partly caused by our heavy reliance on fossil fuels.They say we must drastically and quickly reduce our dependency on carbon-based fuels.\ Unfortunately, New Mexico is almost completely dependent on carbon- based fuels.In fact, 89% of our electricity comes from burning coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel.Coal contains 55% carbon, which when combusted, produces carbon dioxide (CO2), the major culprit in global warming.New Mexico coal fired power plants annually emit a whopping 28 million tons of carbon dioxide and lots of other nasty chemicals.Our coal-fired power plants also release mercury, a highly toxic substance which deposits itself in our lakes and waterways and bioaccumulates in the food chain.\ Why should we worry about global warming?Because really bad things are happening to our environment.Already, certain species of plants and animals have been adversely affected as pollination and reproduction cycles have slid out of sync with local ecosystems.During 1998, a punishing onslaught of unusually severe weather events pummeled human populations around the world with 300 MPH typhoon winds, decimating hurricanes, and a brutal series of floods, fires and droughts.How much more of this can we take?\ New Mexico needs to do its share to mitigate the problem.We need to move away from coal-fired electricity and begin a transition to cleaner fuels like natural gas and renewable energy.This is exactly what the net metering rule suspended by the PRC was designed to do.It would have allowed homeowners to install grid interconnected solar electric systems on their homes.Schools, government offices and businesses would be able to utilize a new generation of micro- turbine and fuel cell energy technologies to make electricity on- site.Under the original PUC net metering rule, the generator of power would receive a credit for the amount of electricity he or she placed into the grid computed at the same price paid to the utility for power consumed.The generator, then, pays the utility for only the ""net"" amount of electricity he or she uses.\ These on-site, natural gas-fired generating systems are far more energy efficient (85% vs. 35% minus transmission losses) than the big coal and nuclear dinosaurs that currently supply our grid electricity.Such ""distributed generation"" systems make heat as well as electricity from natural gas, propane, methanol or hydrogen, and thus can save their users up to 50% on energy bills.And the PRC doesn't think such things are in the public interest?One then must ask: who is the PRC truly representing?\ Residential fuel cells and gas micro-turbines are like home PCs relative to mainframe computers.Some utilities would like to have us permanently locked into an old paradigm of centralized power generation when there is a whole new world of high-efficiency, site- specific energytechnologies just around the corner.And New Mexico is a Saudi Arabia of renewables.We have enough wind and solar resources to easily power the entire southwestern region of the U.S.It's time to put these resources to work.\ To be fair, the utilities are concerned about system size, customer safety and loss of electricity sales.They say the size of the net-metered system should be drastically reduced from the 1 MW (Megawatt) mentioned in the PUC Rule, and the energy source should be limited to solar or wind.\ But businesses like hotels, who will require a gas-fired micro- turbine system that runs 24 hours a day, should be able to participate in the program, and homeowners who opt to lease or purchase residential fuel cells should not be excluded either.Everyone should have a right to generate their own power without undue technical restriction unless it harms the public good.As to reductions in utility electricity sales, such losses will be offset by increased natural gas sales.And plenty of new income generating opportunity exists if utilities and electric co-ops would consider providing a wider range of energy services.These new technologies clearly benefit the public good because they save money for their owners, create new jobs in the community and are far more environmentally benign and energy efficient than dirty coal plants and dangerous nuclear facilities.\ The fact is, distributed generation technologies are clearly the wave of the future, and something that utilities should not be allowed to block unless there is good reason.Nobody is going to install coal-firedgenerators or nuclear power plants in their backyard, but all electric power users should be able to take advantage of the cleaner power systems.\ As to safety, 26 states have already adopted simple, low-cost, utility interconnect policies that have met rigorous safety criteria.The New Mexico net metering rule incorporates these safeguards.\ If our PRC truly intends to act in the public and the environment's best interest, it needs to allow a broad-based, fair, net metering rule to become enacted into law as soon as possible.\ Charles Bensinger is a member of the Board of Directors of the New Mexico Solar Energy Association and a renewable energy consultant living in Santa Fe."
218,"Kit Carson Electric Cooperative CEO Luis Reyes explained at a two-hour public briefing Friday (Dec. 10) why the utility's net-metering policy for rooftop solar array owners - ""rooftoppers"" - no longer works.\Rather than announce an alternative plan, he asked the 30 attendees - who included local installers, rooftop owners and several members of the nonprofit Renewable Taos - to come back in two weeks with a solution that solar owners and other KCEC members would all consider a win-win.\Who it affects: Reyes noted, however, that KCEC was willing to honor existing net-metering agreements with current rooftop solar owners. Whatever new policy it adopts will apply only to future installations.\The basic problem is fairly simple: If you have a rooftop photovoltaic (PV) array, you have the option to sell any excess power you generate back into the KCEC grid. At the end of the year, you receive credit for that surplus against the power you draw from the grid during hours when your array isn't generating.\Here's the part that has some members ticked off: Reyes said KCEC pays rooftoppers more for the surplus energy than the co-op pays its regular supplier. If rooftoppers get credited at the retail rate - 11.1 cents per kilowatt hour under the existing rule - they're getting 3.5 to 6.6 cents more - depending on whom you talk to - than KCEC pays supplier Guzman Energy at its wholesale rate.\So, according to Reyes, the rest of KCEC's 27,000 nonsolar members are, in effect, ""subsidizing"" the 550 rooftop solar owners. ""Rooftop solar arrays are currently contributing about 2.7 million kilowatt-hours to the KCEC grid annually,"" he said, ""so we're talking about a subsidy of $250,000.\""This is not just an economic issue,"" Reyes added, ""it's a question of social justice."" The founding principle of a cooperative, he said, is that it serves and benefits all members equally.\A problem that won't go away\Reyes wants to move quickly on the issue because rooftop arrays currently contribute about 3 megawatts of power to the KCEC grid during peak sunshine hours. ""That's about 9 percent of our total capacity,"" he added, ""which is a substantial amount.""\Another reason is that the problem's been around for three years. ""We asked the co-ops in 2016,"" Reyes said, ""but they didn't want to take it on. Nobody wants to touch it because it's a really contentious issue. So we had to take it to PRC [the Public Regulatory Commission].\""It's going to require some PRC changes and some legislative changes,"" he added. ""We've asked PRC to docket a case so we can figure out the best way to move forward.""\Hidden costs factor into the 'subsidy'\There's also the matter of KCEC's debt service costs, which get blended into each member's monthly bill. But nonsolar members carry a larger share of the load than rooftoppers.\According to KCEC spokesman Michael Santistevan, net-metering customers pay a service charge like every other member. ""But if they underproduce,"" he said, ""they pay only the debt service cost for the power they offset. If their array produces 5,000 kWh and they use 6,000 kWh, they pay the debt service cost only on the 1,000 kWh instead of the 6,000 kWh. A regular member, however, has to pay the debt service cost on the entire 6,000.""\But what happens if the rooftopper generates 6,000 kWh and uses only 5,000? In that case, KCEC currently has to pay them at the ""avoided cost"" rate of 3.5 cents for the excess 1,000 - and they pay zero debt service costs, which nonsolar members must pay based on their total usage.\Rooftoppers have special needs\On top of the rate and service-cost discrepancies, there's the infrastructure cost KCEC incurs in order to safely accommodate this two-way delivery system. ""Behind-the-meter applications,"" as they're called, require additional equipment to ensure safety and provide backup power.\Historically, the Kit Carson grid was built as a one-way system with substations that received power transmitted over long-distance, high-tension lines from large coal-burning power plants and distributed that energy to residences and businesses.\""We have to maintain the obligations of the utility: safety, protection, backup power, emergency power,"" said Reyes. ""If for some reason a behind-the-meter application doesn't work, that residence is expecting us to supply it at the same cost as everyone else. That's an obligation we have.""\Renewable Taos talks back\At their Dec. 13 weekly meeting, Renewable Taos members got into a lively, sometimes heated discussion of Reyes' briefing.\""I think the subsidy works the other way,"" said rooftopper John Gusdorf. ""If I generate 10 kWh of excess in a day, those 10 kWh go to my neighbors. They go through Kit Carson's meter - KCEC gets $1.15 in payment, and I get a credit.\""At night, I take those 10 kWh back,"" Gusdorf continued, ""because my solar array is not generating anything, and KC pays Guzman 8.8 cents for that energy at their wholesale rate.\""The subsidy issue is phony,"" said Gusdorf. ""If it's there at all, we [the rooftoppers] are subsidizing other people, which is fine with me. I don't mind contributing a little bit of low-cost renewable energy.""\Gary Ferguson pointed up the value of supporting a local rooftop solar industry, which he feels would die if KCEC reduces the benefit to rooftop owners.\""All of this rooftop money stays local,"" he said. ""It pays the installers and providers. If the power goes out, whatever happens to the county, it's all local. Whereas we're sending millions out of state - not $250,000 but millions - out of state to buy from the power brokers, none of which ever comes back at all.""\Ferguson noted that if you shut down the solar array business and they lay off all their people, they're gone. You won't be able to bring them in six months or a year. ""In the long run, if you look at the Energy Transition Act,"" he added, ""we're going to need gigawatts of renewable energy at the statewide level. We won't be arguing about a mere 15 or 20 megawatts.""\Bob Bresnahan, a Kit Carson board member and founding member of Renewable Taos, took the middle ground. ""Rooftop solar, while certainly a benefit to the environment, is still two or three times more expensive per capita than large solar arrays that are tied to the grid. Besides that, rooftop solar is simply unaffordable for many households.\""Next year, KCEC will achieve a high level of solar penetration,"" he added. ""This means that when new rooftop solar installations come online, we're going to have to curtail solar generation somewhere. So the question of fairness arises. Are we going to curtail it at the grid scale, which is costing us about 4 cents per kWh [from KCEC solar installations], or are we going to curtail it behind the meter [from rooftop arrays]?""\Bresnahan indicated that he had negotiated the ""grandfather clause"" with Reyes, which would keep existing agreements in place with current rooftop owners.\""I feel that new rooftop is not in the interests of our community going forward,"" Bresnahan said, ""unless it has storage included.""\Another choice\Bresnahan proposed ""decoupling"" as one solution to the alleged inequity. In other words, the actual cost of the energy would be separated from infrastructural costs for billing purposes.\""What's currently happening is that infrastructure costs are being layered onto the energy costs that get passed along to KCEC members,"" said Bresnahan. ""If we just passed through the energy costs to members at the wholesale rate along with a small handling charge, then we could bill solar owners for a true infrastructure charge that covers the costs related to their array.""\Bresnahan also said he'd asked Reyes to commit to solving this issue locally. ""We really want to respect and nurture our rooftop owners - not undermine them. We have to give everybody who's involved, including existing rooftop owners and local installers, a voice in the solution. We can find a win-win if we get everyone in it together.""\Storage has to be considered\Jay Levine, the RT president, said, ""We really need to figure out how storage fits into this. I think it's fair to ask people installing new solar to add storage to their system, especially now that the cost of solar has gone down so much. There has to be a way for KCEC as the utility to manage that.""\Levine also mentioned a safety issue Reyes had brought up. ""There's a concern about feeder lines - the local distribution that goes into a neighborhood. If there's too much solar in a neighborhood, the voltage could overwhelm those feeder lines, and that's a big problem.""\But that can also be resolved by storage, he added, either behind-the-meter storage at the rooftop installation or storage on the grid in that particular area.\Levine agreed with Bresnahan that more discussion of decoupling is in order. If we break out these numbers, he said, then each household is paying only for its own usage and infrastructure needs.\""If we break these things up, then rooftoppers are putting power on the grid at the same rate Guzman is charging, so it eliminates that idea of rooftoppers being subsidized,"" Levine added."
219,"
Consumers considering installing solar panels on their rooftops have far more to think through than the initial decision to ""go solar.""
\
They may search for the best price, only to discover, as customers in central Florida did, that after paying $20,000-40,000 for their BlueChip Energy systems, they are stuck with installations that may be unusable or unsafe. Buyers thought they were getting a good deal and doing the right thing for the environment. Instead, they were duped.

A year ago, it was revealed that BlueChip Energy's solar panels had counterfeit UL labels--this means that the panels may not comply with standard safety requirements established by the independent global certification company Underwriters Laboratory. The Orlando Sentinel reports: ""UL testing assures that a product won't catch fire, will conduct electricity properly and can withstand weather. Without such testing, no one is certain if the solar panels may fail."" Additionally, it states: ""Without the safety testing, they shouldn't be connected to the electric grid."" Other reports claim that BlueChip inflated the efficiency rates of its photovoltaic panels, which do not meet ""65 percent of the company's published performance ratings.""
\
In July 2013, BlueChip's assets were sold off at pennies on the dollar and customers were left with rooftop solar packages that now have no warranty.
\
With the shakeout in the solar photovoltaic industry, bankruptcy is a key concern for buyers. No company equals no warranty.
\
Two of China's panel makers have failed. On March 20, 2013, Suntech, one of the world's biggest solar panel manufacturers, filed bankruptcy. Earlier in March, Shanghai Chaori Solar became China's first domestic corporate bond default.
\
In February, it was reported that solar panels can be ""dangerous in an emergency."" Firefighters have been forced to stop fighting a fire due to electrocution concerns. The report quotes Northampton, Mass., Fire Chief Brian Duggan as saying electrocution is not their only concern: ""cutting through the roof for ventilation would also take a lot longer."" Springfield, Mass., fire commissioner Joe Conant says: ""nothing will stop them if there's a life to be saved, but if it's simply to save the structure, solar panels may keep them from going on the roof.
\
As if all of that wasn't enough, a new potentially fraudulent scheme has just been exposed.
\
A recent report from the Arizona Republic, points to complaints the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC)--the state's top utility regulator--is getting from Tucson customers of SolarCity Corporation. They claim: ""the solar leasing company is misleading them regarding the state rules for hooking up a solar array.""
\
In essence, customers in Tucson are being told one thing by their utility, Tucson Electric Power (TEP), but something else by a private solar power company, SolarCity--the nation's second largest solar electrical contractor. This has drawn the ire of Bob Stump, Chairman of the ACC. ""This is an issue of consumer protection and solar installer transparency,"" Stump told the Arizona Republic.
\
Stump made his concerns clear in a March 12 letter to Lyndon Rive, SolarCity's Chief Executive Officer: ""I am concerned that you--as well as other solar providers--may be communicating with customers in a way that is both confusing and misleading and which deprives them of the balanced information they need in order to make informed decisions.""
\
The letter states: ""Some customers ... say that solar providers have told them that the rates, rules and regulations applicable to net metering are 'grandfathered,' thereby implying that the rates associated with net metering are not subject to change."" As a result, Stump says: ""Customers are then surprised, disappointed, and angry to learn from TEP that this may not be the case.""
\
As an advocate for responsible energy--which I define as energy that is efficient, effective and economical--I have closely followed what is happening with Arizona's solar industry. There, when the ACC proposed a modification to the net-metering policies to make them more equitable to all utility customers, the solar industry mounted an aggressive PR campaign to block any changes. When the decision was made in November to add a monthly fee onto the utility bills of new solar customers to make them pay for using the power grid, I applauded the effort.
\
In light of this new issue, with a leading solar company misleading customers, it is time for the nation's regulators to take a hard look at their states' policies. Remember, this past summer, Georgia regulators voted for solar leasing such as SolarCity offers.
\
Pat Lyons, one of New Mexico's Public Regulatory Commissioners, watched what happened in Arizona's net metering battle. Upon learning about SolarCity's potential deception, he was alarmed. ""As solar leasing, like SolarCity pushes, moves into additional markets, regulators across the country need to be aware of the potential pitfalls and misrepresentations.""
\
It is vital that solar providers be held to the same high standard to which we hold our electric utilities and are made to answer tough questions about consumer protection, safety, and operation issues. Stump's letter to SolarCity's CEO said he will ""be placing this matter on a Commission open meeting agenda in the near future in order to discuss these important concerns with my fellow commissioners.""
\
It may be too late to protect some solar customers in Tucson, but there is still a chance to make sure others are treated fairly. If things don't change, the dark clouds hovering over the industry will be raining on unsuspecting customers.

220,"Researchers find that some buyers pay for environmentally friendly products because those products act as ""status symbols.""\A report in the Atlanticstates: ""Environmentally-friendly behaviors typically go unseen; there's no public glory in shortened showers or diligent recycling. But when people can use their behavior to broadcast their own goodness, their incentives shift. The people who buy Priuses and solar panels still probably care about the environment—it's just that researchers have found that a portion of their motivation might come from a place of self-promotion, much like community service does good and fits on a résumé.""\With ""green"" having become a status symbol, the affluent can afford it. Yet, their desire to ""broadcast their own goodness"" actually results in higher costs to those who can least afford it.\Solar power is a great example. On the website for SunRun, a solar panel leasing company, through the story of customer ""Pat,"" they even encourage the ""green status symbol"" as a sales feature. While Pat may be happy with her solar panels and ""hopes that all her neighbors will go solar, too,"" her ""green status symbol"" costs all the utility's customers who mostly can't afford to ""go solar.""\As I've written on many times, the idea of solar leasing works because of tax incentives and a system called ""net metering."" First, those tax incentives are paid for by all taxpayers. Anytime the government gives something away, everyone pays for it.\Net metering requires utilities to purchase the extra electricity generated by rooftop solar panels at the full retail rate—even though they could purchase it at a fraction of the cost from the power plant. As more and more people sign up for these programs, it increases the overall cost of electricity. Ultimately, the cost of electricity goes up on the bills of non-solar customers. Due to this ""cost shifting,"" many states are changing the net metering policies so solar customers cover the unpaid grid costs.\This is clear to see in overall rising electric costs—about 3 percent per year according to the Institute for Energy Research—despite the main fuel costs (coal and natural gas) being at all-time lows.\Earlier this month, Investors Business Daily (IBD) addressed another interesting angle: ""Green energy can't compete with $30 oil."" The only way for ""green"" energy—such as wind and solar—to survive, it says, is: ""by the government forcing people to buy them and jacking up electricity and heating prices to families and businesses.""\Recycling, a ""green"" fixture, has taken a toll in the low oil-priced environment. Calling recycling a ""$100-billion-a-year business,"" National Public Radio reporter Stacy Venek Smith, points out: ""Plastic is made from oil, so when oil gets cheap, it gets really cheap to make fresh plastic. When the price of oil gets really low, using recycled plastic can actually be more expensive because it has to be sorted and cleaned."" In Montana, according to the Philipsburg Mail, plastics are no longer being picked up for recycling ""because the price per pound was so low, it didn't cover the cost of gas and mileage to make the trip.""\Fortunately for the recycling industry, but bad for consumers who pay higher prices for plastic products, the Philipsburg Mail concludes: ""A lot of Fortune 500 Companies still want to purchase recyclables to meet sustainability goals.""\Despite claims of ""green prosperity"" that implies such policies can ""fight poverty and raise living standards,"" the opposite is true. Everyone pays more—even those who can least afford it—so the elites, seeking green status symbols, can feel good and appear to be community leaders.\The author of Energy Freedom, Marita Noon serves as the executive director for Energy Makes America Great Inc., and the companion educational organization, the Citizens' Alliance for Responsible Energy (CARE).

221," MID-TERM ELECTION BUZZ IN THE AIR\ Literally every election cycle sees hundreds of illegally placed signs and nothing ever seems to be done about this.\ Each election these things pop up like mushrooms and almost all of them are illegally placed.\ Signs are permitted only on private property, and then only with written permission from the property owner.

222,"Since the American Lung Association launched its annual air quality ratings 17 years ago, Santa Fe County has, year after year, earned a special distinction -- a perfect score. \This hasn't just been good for bragging rights. It's also been good for business. Our pristine skies attract people to live, visit, locate events and start companies here. Clean air is the essence of Santa Fe's identity. \But, this year, for the first time in those nearly two decades of record keeping, Santa Fe has lost its A-rating because of occasional high ozone levels -- a factor that can contribute to asthma, heart disease and a range of other ailments. \This is troubling news. But it's hardly surprising. As a state, we continue to rely on coal -- one of the leading contributors of ozone and other toxic chemicals -- for most of our electricity production. \We can fix this problem. By moving away from dirty and dangerous coal and toward cleaner alternatives like solar, we can not only repair our air quality but also save money and create jobs in the process. Solar is growing in New Mexico -- but special interest lobbyists are still trying to stop it. We need New Mexico's lawmakers and Gov. Susana Martinez to stand up for cheaper, cleaner power. \Solar accounts for only about 4 percent of state's electricity production, but there's a strong and growing case for increasing that share. Over the past decade, the cost of solar energy has fallen by half. Residential solar installations reduce power bills, increase property values and, over the long run, pay for themselves. Solar firms have demonstrated that they create jobs at a faster rate than other energy companies. They now account for about 1,900 jobs here in New Mexico. Solar energy already is making our economy stronger and more sustainable. \In New Mexico and states around the country, a commonsense public policy makes this progress possible. Through a program called net metering, New Mexico residents are allowed to generate their own electricity and get credit for power they share with the grid for others to use. It's a simple way to ensure that people who produce electricity can access it when they need it to power their homes. \For the sake of our economy, our air and our energy future, we need to support net metering. In this election year, public officials across the state need to explain clearly to voters whether they make quality jobs and clean air for New Mexicans a priority or make campaign contributions from special interests a priority. The choice is simple. \In the coming years, there are important steps we can take to expand solar energy. The state attorney general can initiate a study to assess the benefits of net metering for consumers and the environment, so we can make fact-based decisions about the future of the program. \We also can take proactive steps to restore tax incentives that treat solar energy fairly relative to oil and gas. We can open the door to community solar -- shared systems that make it possible for renters to access the benefits. Based on successful efforts in California, Oregon, Hawaii, Vermont and elsewhere, we also need to set strong statewide renewable energy targets to steer public policy and promote green growth. \Santa Fe County's air quality downgrade should be a wake-up call. We need a clean energy revolution in this state. We can solve the air quality crisis, while creating jobs, empowering consumers and expanding the economy. \Regina Wheeler is chief executive officer of SunPower by Positive Energy Solar in Santa Fe.\Credit: Regina Wheeler"
223," Solar electricity remains out of reach for many New Mexicans, but new options are bringing the price down\ Paul Benson picked a plum off the tree in his yard and took a bite, then pointed to a few innocuous gray boxes on the side of his house.\ Examining one of them - the electric meter that measures how much energy his house uses - he confirmed, ""Let's see ... yep. The meter is running backwards.""\ Much as leaves gather energy from the sun to create juicy fruit, eight photovoltaic solar panels on his roof recently began collecting photons as part of a system that converts light into something novel: electricity.\ What's more, that electricity was flowing from Benson's house on the west side of town to the electric grid for use in some nearby home or office. As the meter runs backwards, the Bensons receive credit for electricity production, which offsets the amount the family of four uses after the sun goes down.\ Their first electric bill was 8 cents (plus the $3 fee that all PNM customers pay).\ Solar electricity started out as an off-the-grid lifestyle for people with the means and the desire to make a difference. These days, people in the industry say it can be cheaper than running power lines to properties that are more than a half mile from the nearest power pole.\ Benson's ""net-metering"" system is a relatively new trend, which brings the price down even further by tying into the electric grid. The grid replaces expensive battery banks, accepting any extra electricity produced and providing the same whenever necessary. No longer all-or-nothing, this approach allows people to supplement their energy needs according to budget or build a solar system in small increments.\ But make no mistake: Solar power remains expensive, especially in a state like New Mexico, which has little in the way of economic incentives for alternative energy. The price for off-grid photovoltaic systems generally runs from $10,000 to $25,000, according to Allan Sindelar, owner of Positive Energy.\ ""The majority of our business has always been off-grid,"" said Sindelar, although net-metering systems like that of the Bensons represent the greatest increase in business. Positive Energy has installed, or is working on, 10 such systems. Sindelar first recommends a host of ways to increase energy efficiency, then designs systems around a family's needs. ""This is very expensive stuff, and you want it to do as much as it can.""\ Figuring that his system will cover 90 to 100 percent of his summer electricity needs and 70 percent during the winter, Benson said his system might not pay for itself for 20 years - perhaps sooner if the price of electricity goes up. In California, it might be five to eight years, Benson noted, because people there get rebates on installation.\ But he doesn't like to talk about ""payback,"" a subject that never comes up about coal-fired power, which comes with greenhouse gases and host of other emissions. Payback discussions in that industry would include the environmental and health costs of air pollution and global warming.\ At the age of 33, Benson has a long history in clean energy. He and his family lived entirely off-grid in Madrid for five years. He is the president of Santa Fe-based Dankoff Solar Products, which boasts of being the largest provider of solar water-pump equipment in the world. On this day he sported shorts and a T-shirt bearing the name BP Solar, part of the giant oil company's effort to move beyond petroleum. BP Solar's photovoltaic panels are on his roof and others around town.\ As he sees it, efforts by BP and other oil companies to get into renewables are evidence that renewable energy is coming of age. As with anything else, the price of solar electricity comes down each year as the market grows, Benson noted, and the industry has grown at 35 to 45 percent annually in recent years. Deployed on a massive scale, solar advocates say, these and other alternative energy sources could be just as cheap as coal without damaging the environment.\ ""We're doing our part to make the world a better place, to help an industry grow,"" Benson said. Using a ""clean-power estimator"" on BP Solar's Internet site, he calculated that his use of solar energy will save 2,600 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions each year.\ ""That's like the weight of your car, every year,"" he said. ""That's the junk from the smokestack to keep your house running."""
224,"This year, Las Cruces is focused on a bold goal: the city is aiming to be 80-percent energy self-sufficient by 2050 and net-zero in energy usage by 2070.\This isn't just talk. Las Cruces is making serious progress in driving solar projects and efficiency improvements, and, last year, the city became the first in New Mexico to receive a nationally recognized rating for sustainability.\We all know these are good moves for improving air quality and cutting emissions. But the biggest advantages of green energy are actually for our economy. By expanding solar, wind and energy efficiency, Las Cruces can cut consumers' electricity costs and create jobs.\As solar prices have fallen dramatically — to half what they were in 2008 and one one-hundredth of what they were in 1978 — New Mexico's generation capacity has grown tremendously. There's now enough solar in our state to power 83,000 homes. The growth of the industry has meant the creation of 1,900 new high-quality jobs statewide. It's also created considerable new savings for ratepayers and bolstered home values — all while offsetting some of the pollution caused by burning coal.\This is why people across the political spectrum support green energy. According to a recent study, 91 percent of Americans believe we should be speeding up our transition toward clean power as a means to protect the planet, save money and spur innovation. But, in New Mexico, we've still got serious work ahead of us. We're still getting less than 5 percent of our power from solar. And some out-of-state special interest groups are actually fighting to stop the growth of green energy.\Right now, New Mexico's political leaders need to commit to simple, popular, and cost-effective policies to enable our region's green growth. There are three policies in particular that can make the difference:\The first is called ""net metering."" Under this popular program, New Mexico residents can generate their own power and get credit for what they share with the grid for others to use. By supporting net metering, New Mexico's elected officials can promote the growth of solar and ensure that homeowners who generate electricity can use it when they need it.\The second is the state residential tax credit — a cost-effective program that has enabled more than 5,500 New Mexico households to go solar and leveraged about $30 million in private sector investment. Across America, renewables receive only a small fraction of the subsidies that fossil fuels receive. By reinstating these lapsed credits, the Legislature and government can enable the state to meet its energy goals while helping homeowners save money and boost property values.\The third way elected officials can help our green transition is by expanding our state's Renewable Portfolio Standard. Recent polling has found that 80 percent of Americans, including strong majorities of conservative Republicans, support requiring utilities like PNM to generate more clean power. New Mexico's RPS is already creating a cleaner environment and a more competitive economy. But we can do better. California's ambitious renewable standard (50 percent clean energy by 2030) has so far created an estimated 25,500 annual construction jobs as well as thousands of other well-paying jobs in transportation, administration and finance.\New Mexico has a thousand times more renewable energy potential than we actually need to power our homes and businesses. Las Cruces is seizing the moment and tapping the potential. But — for the sake of our economy, our environment, and our employment situation — we need to move quickly. And this requires stronger political leadership.\Regina Wheeler is the CEO of SunPower by Positive Energy Solar.\CREDIT: Regina Wheeler"
225," ENVIRONMENT\ Power:  Fuller hasn't bought gas in 2 years\ ALBUQUERQUE -- Larry Fuller is surfing the perfect storm in world events: rising gas prices, Mideast violence and what many say is the end of cheap energy.\ Fuller, a retired avionics technician, doesn't have a big political agenda. He just likes to build things, and he really likes to save money.\ That's why he powers his 2,000-square-foot house -- and his truck -- with solar panels and a small wind turbine.\ ""It's something that I think that anybody who is willing to put a little time into can do,"" Fuller said.\ Fuller decided to invest in solar energy eight years ago, when oil was selling for roughly $11 to $15 a barrel and he could power his house with electricity for about\ $55 a month. He missed many of the solar tax breaks signed into law with the Energy Policy Act of 2005, though.\ ""That's the price early adopters pay,"" Fuller said.\ Fuller's accomplishments are impressive even to the most hard- core tightwad. He hasn't bought gasoline or diesel fuel for 212 years. He often makes more power than he can use, and his electric meter spins backward. And last spring, when a terrific storm wiped out much of Albuquerque's power grid, Fuller's home was a bright refuge for neighbors that needed help.\ But Fuller is modest, and he'd rather talk about the hardware.\ He's refurbishing a rambling brick home in the central part of the city. Fuller has 31 solar panels on his property. Each of the 110 watt panels face south.\ Fuller doesn't remember how much the panels cost altogether, but he knows he paid $2,600, or $650 each, for four panels in 2003. At that price, the total cost of the panels, which includes shipping, could come to more than $22,000 over the past decade.\ Sunlight is collected by the panels in a 28-volt current before it goes into two 4,800-watt inverters. He bought those in 1998 and 2000 for $2,500 each. The inverters convert the solar power to the standard household current, which is 120 volts.\ All this means Fuller has enough power, more than enough, to run a 400-watt television, a 500-watt swamp cooler, a 1,000-watt coffee pot and a 400-watt refrigerator all at once, with solar power to spare.\ There's also four lead and acid batteries tucked away in one corner of his home to hold a day's worth of power for emergencies. Those cost $600 altogether.\ ""It's not complicated once it's up here,"" Fuller said of his solar system from his roof. ""They're going to sit up here for the next 25 to 30 years and produce power.""\ His meter was spinning backward on a sunny summer day. That meant he was producing more power than he was using. That program is referred to as net-metering by PNM and the customers who use it.\ There are 92 customers enrolled in PNM's net-metering program, a company spokesman said. A separate program, which requires installing a second electric meter, pays solar producers 13 cents per kilowatt hour for the electricity they produce. There are 83 customers enrolled in that program.\ Fuller also has a 400-watt wind generator on his roof that cost about $300. He bought that in 2000.\ Later that morning, Fuller zipped through Albuquerque at 30 mph in an electric truck. He bought the Global Electric Motorcars vehicle for $7,200 in March 2004, and he hasn't purchased gas since.\ At current prices, it costs the average American about $2,095 per year -- for gasoline alone -- to drive 15,000 miles.\ Fuller's truck is small, but it does the job. He can haul up to 900 pounds from places like Home Depot. It has a four horsepower motor and six batteries. At night, he flips a little cap in the front and plugs the truck into his solar powered home.\ ""It's a good way to save money,"" Fuller said.\ For more information, go to www.pnm.com or the New Mexico Solar Energy Association at nmsea.org."
226,"* A photovoltaic array, follows the arc of the sun, powering all electric needs -- lights, washer/dryer, television, stereo\Perched on top of a juniper-covered hilltop past a stretch of steep and deeply rutted dirt roads, Paul and Stephanie Benson's Cerrillos home is one example of the way solar power can serve a home's energy and heating needs.\Equipped with an eight-panel photovoltaic array, which slowly follows the arc of the sun, all of the Bensons' electric needs -- lights, washer/dryer, television, stereo -- are powered by solar energy.\Energy produced by a photovoltaic array is converted from DC to AC, or household current. Unused energy is usually stored in a series of batteries to reserve power for nighttime and during cloudy or overcast days.\""With the batteries, we have enough power for two to three weeks with no sun whatsoever,"" Paul Benson said. ""We've never been without power.""\He said the decision to use solar energy or ""go off the grid,"" was made by the home's previous owner who discovered the closest power source was about three miles away. He said to bring utility power from that distance would cost about $60,000, whereas the photovoltaic system cost only about $20,000 to install.\Benson, who is operations manager for Dankoff Solar Co., said there are two basic reasons why people use solar energy: either they are isolated from utility power sources or they advocate cleaner alternative energy sources.\For people already connected to utility power but interested in using alternative energy, retrofitting their homes with solar power systems can often be an expensive proposition.\But, several local solar companies say there are ways for interested home-owners to be more environmentally friendly through solar power technology without losing a lot of cash.\One of the newest ways in northern New Mexico for home-owners with utility power to retrofit a solar energy system is called ""grid interactive solar systems,"" or ""net metering.""\Like other solar energy systems, it uses a photovoltaic array to generate power during the day. However, this system doesn't create back-up power for household use and therefore eliminates expensive batteries.\Instead, power generated by this system will be tracked by a special meter and bought back by the utility company, said Stephen Conrad, with the Public Service Company of New Mexico's electric and natural gas services department.\The state's Public Utility Commission supports the program and is scheduled this month to issue a request for bid proposals from solar service and supply companies for the meters, Conrad said.\Residents interested in this program would sign a contract with the utility company and be outfitted with a ""special meter capable of running in two directions.""\Mark Sardello, owner of Sardello Solar Consulting Co., said he is working on the first prototype system in this state for a resident in Santa Fe.\""I think only two people have attempted net metering in New Mexico and they were using wind power,"" he said.\Prices for such solar energy systems vary according to the number of solar cells, and depending on size could eliminate monthly electric bills, Sardello said.\Residents could even potentially produce more energy than they use in a given month and receive a reimbursement check from the utility company.\However, energy generated that exceeded utility usage would be purchased back at a price equivalent to production costs, which is currently a little less than a penny a kilowatt hour, he said.\After several years, the equipment could pay for itself, he said. But, he emphasized that its primary purpose is to reduce harmful emissions from fuels, such as coal, used by utility companies.\""The typical size residential system can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by one to two tons per year,"" he said. ""I don't propose (the system) as a money-making investment. There is a return on your investment but it is not huge.""\Aside from energy producing photovoltaic systems, there are other technologies that employ solar power.\Interested residents can purchase solar heating technologies for water and space heating.\Usually, solar heating technologies consist of a collector plate that absorbs the sun's heat and transfers it to a conduit filled with a medium such as air or antifreeze.\In the case of solar water heating systems, this medium is then circulated to a storage area to heat the household's water. In the case of solar space heating, the hot air is directly circulated throughout the home.\In many cases, solar water and space heaters are ""active systems"" using pumps and fans powered by photovoltaic energy to circulate the heat.\Peter Biondo, owner of Golden Sun Solar and Heating Co., said many solar heating systems are cost effective.\""In the sense of payback (a solar space heating system) can buy itself back in four to five years in the case of a home electric heating about seven years in the case of propane and, around nine years for natural gas,"" he said.\Before a resident invests several thousand dollars in solar heating equipment, residents should inspect their home insulation, he said.\""The first thing I look at when I inspect a building is if it will hold the heat,"" he said. ""If it's not properly insulated just adding a solar heating system doesn't make any sense. They would be wasting their money.""\Biondo said the demand for solar heating systems in northern New Mexico is high and continues to increase.\For those people in the process of building or remodeling a home adding passive solar heating design elements such as Trombe walls and clerestory windows can reduce monthly heating bills.\Benson, who is finishing a greenhouse annexed to his kitchen and facing the Ortiz mountains, said the structure heats up to about 85 degrees during the day. The floor is layered with loose rocks which help to retain that heat after sundown, he said.\He estimated that the greenhouse has reduced his usage of propane heaters by about 30 percent.\Although utility power lines have come within about 500 yards of his home over the last year, he said he has no regrets about being on photovoltaics.\""Remoteness from powerlines is just a small piece of the pie,"" he said. ""The bigger one is all about the environment.""\For more information about solar energy alternatives locally and nationwide, you can contact Going Solar at (800) 363-3732."
227," WAR PROTEST NOT A BLANKET STATEMENT\ On Sun., Aug. 6, I marched in Los Alamos to protest the war in Iraq. This war was undertaken by the United States without justification and with tragic consequences.\ A Santa Fe group was in Los Alamos at the same time to ask forgiveness for the 1945 nuclear attack on Hiroshima. I find this idea rather ironic considering the Japanese had attacked us. As a 13- year-old in 1945, I was very pleased that World War II had been brought to an end. There had been times during the war when its outcome seemed uncertain. So a victory for us was welcome indeed.\ A speaker for the Santa Fe group pointed out that the nuclear attack on Hiroshima might have killed nearly a million civilians. To lend perspective, I note that as a result of the Sino-Japanese war (1937-1945) more than 17 million Chinese civilians died. Maybe the Japanese should be asking the Chinese for forgiveness?\ Ernest A.

However, I completely agree with his column of Aug. 6, ""Conservative? Three reasons I'm a liberal,"" in which he states that conservatives should be called by another name.\ Dramatically increasing the national debt is not conservative, it is irresponsible. Waging an unnecessary war is not conservative, it is imperialistic. Tilting the tax structure for the exclusive benefit of the wealthy is not conservative, it is greedy. Putting Social Security at the whim of the stock market is not conservative, it is reckless. Subverting the constitutionally created balance of power among our three branches of government is not conservative, it is treasonous. Spying on Americans is not conservative, it is un- American. Incorporating the religious beliefs of some into official governmental policy is not conservative, it is pandering. What is an accurate new name for conservatives? How about losers in November?\ Roger Brooks\ Tesuque\ Power to New Mexico\ I really like our governor. He's encouraging about energy practices, and he sponsors advertisements about not trashing the environment. OK Bill Richardson, put your and my legislation where your mouth is. Let's have a bottle bill that will underwrite the value of empty bottles and cans and keep them out of arroyos. This can also have the side effect of employing the unemployable, by encouraging them to pick up the empties and redeem them for cash.\ Let New Mexico, one of the sunniest states in these United States, provide tax credits, rebates and net metering for solar and wind-power installations. Twenty-seven states presently provide net metering, (reducing or canceling the cost of electricity to solar and wind generating homes). Nineteen states provide rebates for photovoltaic and wind-power generators. Sixteen states provide tax credits.\ Let's get New Mexico behind this move to solar and wind power, and I will continue to vote for his logical, progressive ideas.\ Art Judd\ Santa Fe\ Burro Alley boondoggle\ In the ongoing quest to make Santa Fe ""The City Un-Different,"" Dickie Montoya Jr. is going after the almighty dollar and kicking Cafe Paris out of its Burro Alley location (Aug. 9, ""Cafe may have to say au revoir to Burro Alley""). Cafe Paris' owners hung on through Burro Alley's long reconstruction and have created a sweet space, a small peaceful haven.\ I'm not looking forward to what the new occupants will do with the Cafe Paris space.\ Kay Carlson\ Santa Fe\ Work for naught\ We were disheartened to hear the situation in which the proprietors of Cafe Paris find themselves, having to vacate their space on Burro Alley. The success of Cafe Paris is the result of the incredible hard work of the Perrier family. Every detail of the restaurant is a labor of love, and, as a result, it has become one of the most unique spaces in Santa Fe.

228,"Tomasita's Restaurant in the Santa Fe Railyard expects to generate more than half its electricity with a new solar photovoltaic parking structure, while providing shade for 24 cars and a plug-in power spot for one electric vehicle. \""The idea is it will be for customers,"" said George Gundrey, the restaurant's owner and manager. ""The spirit behind it is someone can come in and have an enchilada while charging their car."" \The 210 solar panels that create the restaurant's solar carport, made by California-based SunPower, form a 68.67-kilowatt, grid-tied system, designed and installed by Positive Energy Solar in Santa Fe. Gundrey said the system is designed to produce 85 percent of the restaurant's electricity between the peak power-use hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. \He said he won't know the actual solar power produced until the system has been in use for awhile. Public Service Company of New Mexico will inspect the final connection of the photovoltaic carport to the restaurant over the weekend. \Gundrey said the drop in prices for solar panels in the last couple of years, combined with a 30 percent federal solar tax credit, made this the right time to invest in the system. He expects the payoff on the system's $325,000 price tag to take seven years after the tax credit. The system is supposed to last at least 25 years, according to Positive Energy Solar. \""It's a really affordable time,"" Gundrey said. ""I've always cared about the environment and trying to reduce our footprint and be more efficient. We're a solid business, and I'm confident the payout will be worth it."" \Gundry said the system will offset the most expensive electricity the restaurant uses. He said PNM charges more for power used during peak daytime periods, exactly when the sun is shining and his solar panels will be producing electricity. \Off-peak electricity, typically at night, costs the restaurant 3.93 cents per kilowatt-hour year-round, Gundry said. The cost during peak hours, from June through September, is 8.44 cents per kilowatt-hour. The restaurant pays 6.99 cents per kilowatt-hour for peak power October through May. \The power generated by the panels will be credited against the electricity the restaurant uses through net metering. In addition, under state regulations, the restaurant will earn about a nickel per kilowatt-hour produced each month from PNM as a Renewable Energy Credit. The credits help PNM meet state-mandated requirements for renewable energy. \""Our solar array will help us control our energy costs, but most importantly, it will mean cleaner air, decrease emissions of toxic chemicals and reduce our impact on climate change,"" Gundrey said in a statement. \Positive Energy Solar, which designed and installed the solar carport, has installed more than 1,000 residential and commercial solar systems across the state. \Solar technology ""is a smart investment that allows restaurant owners to hold energy costs down, while differentiating themselves,"" Regina Wheeler, Positive Energy Solar's chief executive officer, said in a statement. \Contact Staci Matlock at 986-3055 \or smatlock@sfnewmexican.com.\Credit: Staci Matlock The New Mexican"

My copy of ""Enchantment -- the Voice of New Mexico's Rural Electric Cooperatives"" arrived a few days ago, and out of it fell a page of green-bordered postcards. ""Enchantment"" is a publication of Touchstone Energy Cooperative, which owns Tri-State, which owns Kit Carson Electric Cooperative (KCEC).
\
In bold letters each card said WE NEED YOUR HELP. Well I try to be helpful to the co-op of which I am a member, namely KCEC.
\
The postcards are addressed to our senators and congressmen asking them to keep the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from protecting the environment.
\
Yes, you read that right. They want to revoke the EPA's mandate to enforce the Clean Air Act, which provides jurisdiction over emissions of carbon dioxide, CO2, known to be greatly contributing to global climate change. In the green borders of the cards the text says that we can prevent increases in our electric bills by doing what they ask.
\
Too bad that they weren't concerned about our three previous rate increases without any action by Congress, and which they had promised Kit Carson they would not impose when Tri-State took over KCEC.
\
Elsewhere in the ""Enchantment"" paper they say, ""Help Kit Carson save the environment, natural resources and help the economy! Check out [in the section below].. how together we can become more 'Green!'[sic]."" This is the same company that forced KCEC into a 10-year agreement that no more than 4 percent of its power was to come from renewable resources. All the rest has to come from dirty coal.
\
In spite of all this, I commend KCEC for its program on 'net metering' whereby individuals with solar electric panels can feed back to the coop any extra power they produce.
\
I have 12 panels on my roof and have taken advantage of this program, although serious difficulties have arisen recently. I can't get records of my monthly feedbacks or even how much power we're using.
\
And during a month when we were away last summer, not only did I not receive any credit, but I got the largest bill ever from KCEC. My panels, of course, were operating the entire time we were gone, producing abundant power fed to Kit Carson.
\
To this day I have received no help on this from anyone at KCEC in spite of numerous attempts. I have heard that many people in Taos are having similar problems.
\
Could it be that KCEC's backfeed program is so successful that they are exceeding their 4 percent renewable energy limit, and they don't know how to handle the situation?!
\
In what way are these companies ""cooperatives""? My dictionary defines ""cooperative"" as an ""organization that is owned and run jointly by its members, who share the profits or benefits.""
\
I have yet to receive any share of the profits from Kit Carson, Tri-State, or Touchstone. Has any member?
\
An example of a true co-op is REI, Recreational Equipment Inc. that has over 10 million members all of whom who shop at REI receive an annual dividend check.
\
All we get is regular increases in our electricity rates, which go no doubt to ever increasing compensation for the officers of the corporation.
\
In any case, do write to your Congressional representatives, but tell them to be sure that the Clean Air Act is enforced to regulate CO2, and to enact incentives to produce alternative energy sources to ensure a safe and truly green future for us and our posterity. And while you are contacting them, ask them to make ineffective any forced contracts that limit the amount of alternative energy that we can use.
\
Bob Fitch is a retired scientist who has lived in Taos with his wife Reta for 20 years. He has two sets of solar panels on his roof, for both electricity and heat.

230," It's the dawn of a new era in energy for our state - but before morning is over, New Mexicans are likely to see more changes than the ones enacted this week by the Public Regulation Commission.\ On Tuesday, the PRC approved a rule requiring power companies, by 2011, to generate 10 percent of their electricity from renewable sources - wind, waterflow, solar, biomass or geothermal.\ It's a modest and overdue move toward ending our dependence on coal-fired, smoky steam generators. The percentage of renewable energy would likely increase with technological advances.\ A good start - but it could prove expensive: The rule also allows utility companies to recover their costs by:\ Charging higher ""green"" rates to customers choosing alternative energy; a surcharge for being environmentally responsible, and by\ Passing along the costs of these new investments to all ratepayers.\ To customers of Public Service Company of New Mexico, already being hit with higher bills this winter, the prospect of even higher rates during the decade to come is a dismal one. PNM, to its credit, has agreed to put off rate increases under this rule for five years.\ But PNM and other utilities are chafing over another part of the new rule; a formula aimed at diversifying alternative-energy sources. Under this scheme, a kilowatt of solar power generated by a utility is worth a kilowatt and a half toward satisfying the alternative-energy requirement; wind power is worth only half a kilowatt; geothermal and biomass - burning forest-thinning waste, for example - earn a kilowatt per kilowatt.\ Wind turbines tend to be the most efficient alternative source, and PNM is investing heavily in ""wind farms"" out in the flatlands of Eastern New Mexico.\ Environmentalists are enthusiastic about the PRC's new rule - anything but smokestacks, they must be thinking.\ However, most of these alternative energy sources still will be dependent on long lines, from mostly rural sources to the cities of New Mexico. And that's where the plan seems short-sighted.\ The future of energy, in New Mexico and the rest of the country, lies in on-site generation: microturbines, fuel cells and household solar generators.\ The PRC must prepare for this new generation of generation. The commissioners should be considering workable plans for ""net metering"" - a system by which home generators can feed their excess power to fellow consumers, and receive rebates for their contribution.\ If PNM executives feel put upon by the new alternative-energy rule, just wait until technology allows their household customers to, in effect, compete with them in the power market.\ For now, the power people deserve credit for broadening their horizons beyond the coal-steam plants of the Four Corners.\ The kicking and screaming at PNM's Albuquerque headquarters has been admirably muted - owing, perhaps, to the counsel of Ron Curry. Curry, a former Santa Fe city manager who is about to become environment secretary in the Bill Richardson administration, was contracted in the late '90s to advise PNM on environmentally sensible alternatives to the company's hidebound ways.\ PNM, like so many of our nation's energy giants, still faces a long trek toward solid environmental citizenship, not to mention modern-day efficiency. Its pace, if slow, is in the right direction."
231," NM ORIGINAL\ In Ecoversity workshops women learn to install their own solar energy systems\ It's a warm, windy afternoon, and a group of women are on the roof, measuring metal mounts, cutting rebar and drilling holes. They're using words like ""bushing,"" ""Sawzall"" and ""weatherhead,"" but they're not electricians or engineers.\ ""It took just two weekends to learn about all this stuff,"" says Anne Hubbard, 60, wearing a baseball cap and a pair of white work gloves tucked into the back of her jeans. Like most of the women here, she is learning to install her own solar-powered energy system.\ In a May workshop at the Albuquerque Center for Peace and Justice, about a dozen women learned to install solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and inverters that convert sunlight to electricity. The systems, depending on the way they're set up, will supplement or replace conventional electricity.\ Like the experts they're learning from, the women wanted to minimize their impact on the environment.\ ""I want to watch my footprint on the planet, and (solar energy) is silent, it doesn't pollute,"" says Marlene Brown, the workshop's lead instructor and president of the New Mexico Solar Energy Association. An electrical engineer at Sandia National Laboratories, Brown coordinates workshops and panel discussions through Ecoversity, a Santa Fe-based educational center teaching sustainable living and earth-based vocations.\ The tools you need\ Wearing a maroon T-shirt that says, ""Girls Kick Ass,"" Brown watches her students as they mount a gray junction box inside the building. She answers technical questions and makes sure they have the tools they need.\ The Peace and Justice Center is on the electrical grid, so when the sun goes down, the system will draw electricity from PNM, and when surplus energy is created, it's automatically sent back to the grid, spinning the electrical meter backward.\ ""If enough people do it, they wouldn't have to build another energy plant,"" Brown says of the setup known as ""net metering,"" or interconnecting with the grid. Solar power users who aren't connected to the grid store energy in batteries.\ Brown's passion for harnessing the power of the sun is matched by her commitment to inspiring more women to take charge of their energy use and join technical fields.\ Brown and co-leader Debby Tewa offer New Mexico workshops for women several times a year, and Brown coordinates Women in Solar Energy PV Forums at the American Solar Energy Society's annual conference. This year's will take place in Florida in August.\ Why women only?\ In her years as an engineer, PV consultant and American Solar Energy Society fellow, Brown has taught men and women across the country and around the world how to set up their own solar panels, but she says all-women workshops offer a number of advantages.\ One is to empower women to participate in science, math and technical endeavors.\ Women aren't socialized to pursue math and science, she says, and many don't consider themselves technically savvy.\ In co-ed workshops, women have a tendency to hang back while the men jump in. In a class of women only, they're less intimidated and more inclined to work in community, Brown says.\ ""If we teach a class with all women, they help each other,"" she says. ""At the end when we get a system in, it's so empowering.""\ Up on the roof, it's definitely a team effort. As Penina Ballen, 50, drills a screw into a long piece of gleaming metal to prepare mounts for the roof panels, Kate Cooper, 17, cheers her on.\ ""You're doing great,"" Cooper says, holding the metal piece down as the older woman works the red drill. ""It's getting there.""\ Rare birds\ Both Brown and Tewa, a Hopi, are rare in a technical field still largely dominated by men.\ Brown attributes her affinity for science to her parents, her father a physician and mother a chemist, and says her father always told her she could do anything she wanted.\ ""I never questioned that,"" she says.\ Tewa, who helped erect hundreds of solar power systems on the Hopi and Navajo reservations before becoming an intern at Sandia's Native American Renewable Energy Program, says she was fascinated by gadgets as a kid.\ Her earliest memory is flipping over a bike and inspecting the metal mechanisms alongside the pedals.\ ""I was amazed by how it worked -- the spoke, the chain,"" Tewa says.\ Now, she's passing that technical interest and know-how on to other women. The all-women workshops create an atmosphere of respect and cooperation that lends itself not only to installing their own panels, Tewa says, but also to networking, becoming politically active and teaching others.\ Limitless solar\ While electricity draws upon resources such as coal that can pollute the environment, solar energy offers a limitless source of power without the risk of damaging the environment.\ ""Oil production is peaking, and this seems like a good time to prepare for rising energy costs,"" says Catherine Veblen, 46, as she helps Cooper and Ballen prepare mounts on the roof. ""Everything we do makes a difference."" Veblen planned to install solar panels in her new Corrales home.\ Brown's commitment to conservation is an integral part of her life. She bikes to work at least twice a week, catches rainwater and keeps a compost pile in the back yard of her university-area home. And, she uses solar energy to power her home.\ How it works\ As part of the workshops, women learn how to compute their ""load,"" or the amount of electricity they use, as the first step in designing a solar-powered system. The goal is to reduce the amount of energy you use and increase awareness of how much power appliances like stereos and televisions burn, even when they're turned off. The ""phantom load"" is the amount of energy used by appliances just when plugged in.\ Over the course of the workshop, Hubbard disconnected a portable heater in her home, unplugged the stereo and gave away her hot tub. Mickie McCall, 58, plans to build a solar- and wind-powered community center in her hometown of Candy Kitchen, south of Grants, to demonstrate exclusive use of renewable energy.\ ""We want something totally self-sustaining,"" she says.\ Solar power is also more convenient for people who live in rural areas that aren't on to the grid, such as many households on reservations, Brown and Tewa say.\ Both women have worked with the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority to train and educate technicians on setting up PV systems. Tewa was previously a project manager for NativeSUN, a business that taught Hopi and Navajo tribal members about renewable energy and helped them install PV systems.\ Despite the high cost of installing solar power, it's more expensive and time-consuming to extend the electrical grid, Tewa says. And, for homes that stand alone more than a mile from the grid, it's not considered feasible.\ Economic incentives such as tax credits proposed in the New Mexico Legislature this past session would have made solar power cheaper and more accessible, Brown and Tewa say.\ But in the meantime, they're focusing on educating people about the sun's renewable power.\ ""People are interested in solar technology,"" Tewa says. ""It's become a household word, which I'm proud of.""\ The cost of solar energy\ COST TO INSTALL The average cost to install a basic system, about 1 to 1.2 kilowatts, is $8,000 to $10,000, according to Marlene Brown, president of the New Mexico Solar Energy Association.\ While according to the American Solar Energy Society, solar heating is more cost-effective than electrical heating regardless of incentives, solar panels that power home appliances cost thousands of dollars, depending on their size and the home's electric load.\ TAX INCENTIVES New Mexico doesn't offer financial incentives like those in other states, such as California. A bill proposed in the Legislature this year would have provided corporate and personal tax credits worth 15 percent of the upfront cost of a solar powered system. The bill, which was in the Senate Finance committee when the session ended, did not pass.\ FOR MORE INFORMATION Contact the American Solar Energy Society, at ases.org, or the New Mexico Solar Energy Association, at nmsea.org.

232," Act now for cleaner, more efficient electricity\ Despite the existence of clean technologies for generating electricity, many utilities continue to rely on old fossil fuel- burning power plants. Here in New Mexico for example. 89 percent of our energy comes from coal fired plants. And soot and smog-forming~ air pollution, greenhouse gases and toxic metals such as mercury from these power plants threaten public health and the environment. Energy efficiency, renewable energy such as solar, wind and biomass, and new technologies such as fuel cells make good I and cleaner I sense for New Mexico.\ And now New Mexico has some opportunities to seriously promote renewable energy:\ We need our Congressional delegation to restore the renewable energy budget cut;\ Statewide, we must take advantage of a small but important renewable energy program recently established under the electric restructuring law, and\ Here in Santa Fe, promoting renewable energy and efficiency as part of the on-going Santa Fe Electric franchise discussions with Public Service Company of New Mexico is important.\ It's not too early for citizens, students, school districts, and local governments to begin planning for the kinds of renewable energy projects they'd like to see funded by the renewable energy fund. And it's not too early to tell the state Environment Department to involve citizens and local governments in the development of procedures for distribution of the funds. Customers can also urge their electric utility company to develop renewable energy and provide more electricity generated by solar and wind power.\ Santa Feans have an opportunity to insist that any new franchise contain requirements for energy efficiency, renewable energy and new, clean technologies, as well as promoting distributed generation (small groups of businesses and homes with on-site generation) and net metering (self-generation on-site with excess sales to electric company).\ Lynda Taylor\ Coalition for Clean Affordable Energy\ Santa Fe\ Absurd logic\ The Washington Post editorial on using additional tobacco taxes to shore up Social Security is a prime example of the kind of absurd logic that drives American politics.\ In the editorial it was suggested that increased taxes would provide a social good by deterring people from smoking and at the same time provide a healthy bonus of $36 billion over the next five years which could then be used to supplement Social Security spending. It doesn't sound like much ""deterring"" is going on here if you're expecting that kind of income! More to the point why should smokers be expected to shoulder a greater proportion of the tax burden?\ The actual logic behind all this is that of ""demonization."" If you can make someone or something look ""bad"" or ""less"" somehow, then you can justify rejecting or ostracizing them. Or in this case, taking money from them.\ In fact, this is just one of many absurd logics that intimately dwell within our culture. If you look closely you'll begin to understand why 90 percent of the wealth in this country is in the hands of only 5 percent of the population. Now that is absurd!\ Shannon Thompson\ Las Vegas\ Strange assumptions\ White supremacists, Hitler followers and Klu Klux Klan members all erroneously claim themselves to be Christian organizations. The man who recently shot children in a Jewish school was shown on TV holding up the Holy Bible as his anti-Jewish authority. These are interesting assumptions.\ That Holy Bible he was waving is composed of 66 books each and every one of those 66 books within the covers of the Holy Bible was written by a Jew. Christ came from the lineage of King David a Jewish King. Mary, the mother of Christ, was a Jewish girl. Christ had Jewish blood in his veins. If Mary and Joseph and Jesus had lived in Germany during the reign of Hitler they would have been thrown into concentration camps for being Jews.\ Wouldn't it make better sense for white supremacist groups to hold up a different book to justify their anti-Jewish stance the Satanic Bible maybe?\ Mariel Brito\ Santa Fe\ Save El Seville\ We were stunned when we read in the Sept. 23 issue of The New Mexican that the El Seville Apartments might be torn down to make way for an expansion of the County Judicial Complex.\ We hope that those involved in deciding this matter will stop and ask themselves: ""What are we doing to our city when we continue to displace in-town renters with modest incomes?"" We protest the lack of vision of those who are unable to see the consequences of continuing to replace residents with office buildings.\ New Mexico is planted thick with small communities that have nurtured all of us with their deep and abiding sense of a ""sacramental land."" We must not lose every vestige of that same sense here in Santa Fe. The deeper issues involved in the sale of the El Seville property are quality of life and an affordable environment.\ A.F. Swearingen\ Jack Purdy\ Presbyterian Ministers\ Former Board Members\ of Ghost Ranch, Abiquiu\ Rights infringed\ Police Chief John Denko took it upon himself to force the disbanding of a church group through the use of pepper spray.\ The church group had been assembling together on the street corner for over 14 years to preach the Gospel, during an event when thousands of people are walking the streets of Santa Fe to and from seeing the burning of Zozobra. Such an action by the Chief constituted a major infringement on the rights of every citizen in the United States.\ The Santa Fe Police Department does have some very fine officers who truly know the meaning of ""To Protect and Serve."" On the other hand, Chief Denko and the officers involved in the pepper spraying, have violated their sworn duty to uphold the Constitution and have in fact made in roads into that right through their own unlawful acts in order to further their personal interests.\ John Byers\ Santa Fe\ Paseo stop signs\ After years of effort, stop signs have finally appeared at the dangerous intersection of Paseo de Peralta and Marcy Street. Now, the City's Public Safety Committee, which should be defending the right of pedestrians to cross at this corner without loss of life or limb, wants them removed.\ We strongly urge them to resist the spurious argument that a few seconds of courteous pause at that spot will negatively impact tourism and businesses. To the contrary, the many new galleries on that stretch of Peralta must have live customers to flourish. A dead or injured tourist will be of little use to them.\ Hillside Park, which begins at that corner, is a playground for scores of children throughout the day. For the young and for senior citizens, the lack of traffic control there is an acute and ever- present danger. Is there any sense to having a traffic light at the preceding corner, and stop signs at the next corner, but nothing at the entrance to a public park?\ The intersection in questions is an integral part of a neighborhood, one of the oldest in the city. It is not a segment of an express highway. There are no significant traffic backups at those stop signs. What is happening there is the resolution of chaos into order. That benefits everyone.\ Bill and Ann McGonigle\ Santa Fe\ Signs, safety\ The city's Public Safety Committee wants to remove stop signs at Paseo de Peralta and Marcy.\ The Hillside Neighborhood has worked with the city to get these stop signs installed. The Traffic Division shared our fears regarding the volume and excessive speed of motorists on Paseo de Peralta, and saw the danger for motorists, children and elderly crossing this busy street.\ The stop signs were installed.\ The cry over the delay time to motorists during the peak rush periods was loud and bitter! Maybe a traffic light would be better, someone suggested. The ~light could be timed to work with the light at Palace to speed the pace of traffic. This idea was nixed due to the cost, and the signs that proved their worth, were to be removed!\ We believe that we must have our neighborhood safe regardless of the cost. The City Council will soon vote on whether to remove these safety-stop signs.\ Dave Brewer\ Leo Momsen\ members of the steering committee\ Historic Hillside Neighborhood Association\ Santa Fe\ Sad reflection\ Only about 11 percent of those entitled to vote went to the polls in the recent election. This is a sad reflection of indifference toward one of the most important qualities of democracy: The right of the citizens to determine the manner in which their society operates.\ I frequently drive across the intersection of Paseo de Peralta and Marcy Street. I do not believe that a traffic signal is needed. The ~~two new stop signs on Paseo de Peralta, however, greatly improved the safety of the intersection.\ Franz Leidler M.D.\ Santa Fe\ Weedy editorial\ The recent editorial on weeds was not worthy of The New Mexican.\ The reference to Santa Fe as ""liberal"" was condescending. The reference to weeds as being a safety issue was tiresome. Quoting the city codes re: weeds was a reminder of screwed up priorities.\ Why do cities always have ordinances about the length of weeds, but no ordinances about the toxic pesticides used to kill the weeds? I would rather deal with weeds than deal with a weed-phobic perfectionist who sprays away with no clue of what they are doing to the very air we must breathe.\ J. Marin\ Cochiti Lake"

Thinking about El Paso Electric, it helps to step back and contemplate the situation of electrical utilities generally.
\
These utilities are granted a monopoly on a valuable commodity, they're regulated by the states. Most function under somewhat backward laws that enable them to profit only by buying or building things, which often pressures them to solve problems in otherwise unnecessarily inefficient and (for us) expensive ways.
\
Facing environmental concerns and new alternative forms of energy, the utility companies will soon enter their death spiral. (Industry term, not mine.) The costs of solar panels have declined 75 percent in just the past six years. Most states have ""net metering"" laws letting solar-powered households sell excess electricity back to the grid at retail prices. Arguably, utilities are selling saddles and surreys just when horseless carriages are getting reliable.
\
Even if you doubt all the poisons we're putting in our atmosphere and water will really hurt anything, why would you want to stick with gas-fired electricity plants in any numbers once solar is a lot cheaper -- not only cleaner, safer, and more natural?
\
Currently, utilities vary widely in their reactions to our changing circumstances. Many, of course, choose to attack solar power as an enemy and try to delay progress through TV ads, backward laws, and immense investments in electing friendly faces to regulatory commissions. Arizona's power companies tend to exemplify this approaches.
\
By contrast, Vermont's Green Mountain Power listens to its customers and recognizes they want to do what's environmentally sound if it won't cost them a bunch more money. GMP now offers ""energy makeovers"" (more insulation, new ways of heating home and water, LED lightbulbs, and a small solar array) that are financed through homeowners' rapidly falling utility bills. Vermonters are radically reducing their energy footprint not necessarily because they're worried about climate change, but to save money.
\
We need to recognize that times change and technologies develop. There was a time the public gave railroads everything they wanted, because the country needed railroads. Decades later, that wouldn't have made sense. Similarly, decades ago we needed utilities to build a dependable electrical system, and the best technology was gas-fired plants. Now we need systems that are more energy efficient and economic.
\
In New York, a reform effort sparked by Hurricane Sandy led to the appointment of an energy czar who developed a program of incentives called Reforming the Energy Vision. Where Con Ed had initially planned to build a billion-dollar substation to meet growing electrical demand in Brooklyn, the utility instead will encourage installation of solar panels and new storage batteries, and will pay customers to limit usage during peak hours. That'll save many millions of dollars. Although REV is an unproven work-in-progress, New York is at least asking the right questions.
\
There are two keys: technology and regulatory vision. As technology improvements help us move from ""Can we get the homeowner to invest some money to help the environment"" to ""Can we educate the homeowner on how to save money and help the environment,"" we also need our regulators to deal fairly but firmly with electric utilities. In part, that means developing programs that eliminate the strong financial incentive for utilities to trick us into approving an expensive new gas-fired generating plant we'll be stuck paying for over the next half-century.

Thinking about El Paso Electric, it helps to step back and contemplate the situation of electrical utilities generally.
\
These utilities are granted a monopoly on a valuable commodity, they're regulated by the states. Most function under somewhat backward laws that enable them to profit only by buying or building things, which often pressures them to solve problems in otherwise unnecessarily inefficient and (for us) expensive ways.
\
Facing environmental concerns and new alternative forms of energy, the utility companies will soon enter their death spiral. (Industry term, not mine.) The costs of solar panels have declined 75 percent in just the past six years. Most states have ""net metering"" laws letting solar-powered households sell excess electricity back to the grid at retail prices. Arguably, utilities are selling saddles and surreys just when horseless carriages are getting reliable.
\
Even if you doubt all the poisons we're putting in our atmosphere and water will really hurt anything, why would you want to stick with gas-fired electricity plants in any numbers once solar is a lot cheaper -- not only cleaner, safer, and more natural?
\
Currently, utilities vary widely in their reactions to our changing circumstances. Many, of course, choose to attack solar power as an enemy and try to delay progress through TV ads, backward laws, and immense investments in electing friendly faces to regulatory commissions. Arizona's power companies tend to exemplify this approaches.
\
By contrast, Vermont's Green Mountain Power listens to its customers and recognizes they want to do what's environmentally sound if it won't cost them a bunch more money. GMP now offers ""energy makeovers"" (more insulation, new ways of heating home and water, LED lightbulbs, and a small solar array) that are financed through homeowners' rapidly falling utility bills. Vermonters are radically reducing their energy footprint not necessarily because they're worried about climate change, but to save money.
\
We need to recognize that times change and technologies develop. There was a time the public gave railroads everything they wanted, because the country needed railroads. Decades later, that wouldn't have made sense. Similarly, decades ago we needed utilities to build a dependable electrical system, and the best technology was gas-fired plants. Now we need systems that are more energy efficient and economic.
\
In New York, a reform effort sparked by Hurricane Sandy led to the appointment of an energy czar who developed a program of incentives called Reforming the Energy Vision. Where Con Ed had initially planned to build a billion-dollar substation to meet growing electrical demand in Brooklyn, the utility instead will encourage installation of solar panels and new storage batteries, and will pay customers to limit usage during peak hours. That'll save many millions of dollars. Although REV is an unproven work-in-progress, New York is at least asking the right questions.
\
There are two keys: technology and regulatory vision. As technology improvements help us move from ""Can we get the homeowner to invest some money to help the environment"" to ""Can we educate the homeowner on how to save money and help the environment,"" we also need our regulators to deal fairly but firmly with electric utilities. In part, that means developing programs that eliminate the strong financial incentive for utilities to trick us into approving an expensive new gas-fired generating plant we'll be stuck paying for over the next half-century. The rules should encourage and reward best practices by both the utility and the homeowner or business.
\
Unfortunately, New Mexico's current governor ain't likely to be in the market for sensible and creative ways to get constituents the best possible value from their electric utilities.

235,"Facebook is courting support from the Public Service Company of New Mexico and state regulators to build a $250 million data center south of Albuquerque that could launch more green energy and tech jobs in the state over the next 20 years. \But the social media giant, with 1.65 billion users, said before it decides whether to locate in New Mexico or Utah, it needs a guarantee that the facility can be 100 percent powered by renewable energy -- either solar or wind. \Facebook confirmed these intentions and its efforts to locate a data center in the Southwest. It did not comment on a specific site, but others have said it is looking at an 850-acre parcel in Los Lunas known as the Huning Ranch Business Park, near Interstate 25 and N.M. 6. City leaders already have voted to provide lucrative tax incentives for a large out-of-state company using the name Great Kudu LLC to build a data center. \The company insisted on anonymity because it was still in land negotiations, but Los Lunas Mayor Charles Griego said Friday a description of the project from PNM sounds a lot like that project. ""I have no reason to doubt it's Facebook, but I haven't been told,"" he said. \PNM filed an application with the Public Regulation Commission on Friday seeking the authority to transmit at least 30 megawatts of solar power to the Facebook data center, and the ability to add as much additional renewable energy as needed over a 25-year agreement with the Internet company, in anticipation of expansion. According to the agreement, Facebook would foot the bill for all costs, including its hookup to the utility grid, the cost of solar panels or wind turbines, and the cost of eventually decommissioning the power site. \The proposal marks a shift in PNM's position on solar power. Throughout several cases before the PRC, the utility has said solar is costly, places excess financial burden on non-solar customers, and still relies on traditional energy sources, such as nuclear power or coal, as backup. \But the new application and a PNM spokesperson said the deal with Facebook would only benefit other New Mexico power customers. \PNM's filing with the PRC says the data center could bring more than 200 construction jobs. It would have 30 to 50 full-time employees during the startup period, with the potential for hundreds more as it expands. The filing notes that Facebook approached PNM about the center. \A Facebook spokeswoman said the company has not identified a specific location for a data center but wants to be ready when it needs more capacity. The proposal fits into the company's own clean energy goals. In July 2015, Facebook pledged to operate on 50 percent renewable power sources by 2018. \""We're always evaluating potential new sites as we expand our global infrastructure and develop a pipeline for future data center locations. But we're not committing to anything right now,"" she said. ""When evaluating potential new sites, it's important to have all the information we need readily available -- including our access to renewable energy. By doing work upfront, we can move fast when we do need more capacity."" \To meet the demands of the massive data storage center, which might be the size of two Wal-Mart Supercenters, PNM is asking the state Public Regulation Commission to approve a Green Energy Rider, which would allow the utility to meet the full renewable energy demands of the company, both for the initial stages of the project and for future growth throughout the 25-year agreement. \The project is expected to meet the demands for a 30 megawatt data center in the Southwest, with the potential to expand beyond 100 megawatts. \PNM hopes to outbid the Rocky Mountain Power Co. in Utah, which is the other site Facebook is considering. Rocky Mountain already has a proposal before the Utah Public Service Commission. \Los Lunas has been at the fore of efforts to recruit new corporate businesses with tax incentives, starting with a Wal-Mart distribution center. Last month, the city approved the sale of up to $30 billion in industrial revenue bonds in six phases for a large data center, Griego said. Any land for the project would be owned by the city until the bonds are retired, and therefore exempt from property taxes. \PNM claims that Phase 1 of the data center would cost more than $250 million. The company also says the data center and power project would help create other economic development opportunities and ""support 4,000 to 5,000 jobs over a number of years,"" according to documents filed with the PRC. \Like most tech firms, Facebook requires a massive amount of storage. It initially leased space in California but since 2010 has built its own data centers in Oregon, North Carolina, Iowa and Sweden. Another is under construction in Fort Worth, Texas. \While the PNM filing states the center may bring thousands of jobs, the Facebook center in Prineville, Ore., employs fewer than 200 people, according to a September 2015 article in the Oregonian. \""While many large industries rely on tax breaks to reduce operating costs, they usually win those favors in exchange for the promise of high numbers of jobs. Data centers are different,"" the story said. ""They don't need many people -- 147 work at Facebook's Prineville site -- just power, water and Internet connectivity. \""Since data centers can be anywhere, they have enormous negotiating leverage with small communities and use that leverage to win large tax deals. That's why Facebook and Apple (both in Prineville), along with Google (The Dalles) and Amazon (Morrow County) are all building rural data centers."" \In order to remain competitive, PNM is asking the New Mexico PRC to approve its request no later than Aug. 31 and waive the right for a public hearing. \But Regina Wheeler, CEO of Santa Fe-based Positive Energy Solar, argues that the public hearing is essential to ensure PNM goes about the deal in a way that is fair to the state's businesses and ratepayers. \""I would be very excited to hear that PNM has a proposal and has started to really embrace the opportunity of clean renewable, affordable solar as a way to provide energy to New Mexico businesses and homes,"" she said. But without a formal hearing process, she said, ""I don't know if this proposal is fair and in the best interest of New Mexicans."" \The public deserves to assess whether the company plans to use assets paid for by ratepayers to leverage its appeal to a private company and potentially create unfair competition with other local businesses, she said. \Wheeler noted that for years, PNM has expressed opposition to solar power purchased independently by homeowners and businesses, saying renewable energy customers add unfair strain to other customers on the grid. She said Facebook should be no different. \Pahl Shipley, a spokesman for PNM Resources, the utility's parent company, said Facebook would benefit other customers in the state, who will not incur an increase in utility rates or other charges. \""Since the costs of service are spread among all customers, adding a large customer will reduce the amount other customers pay,"" Shipley said in an email. ""... It will have no impact on PNM customers, other than [this] benefit."" \Shipley said Facebook's renewable energy facility will still rely on PNM's traditional power sources. \""Simply put, renewable energy still requires 100 percent backup by fossil fuel or nuclear generation,"" he said. \The application to the PRC notes that should Facebook's energy demand exceed the solar power resources available, PNM will tap into backup nuclear power supplied from the Palo Verde facility at ""market rate."" \Traditionally, when the company purchases or shuts down an energy facility, those costs show up in utility bills. The PRC is currently deliberating over how much PNM can charge New Mexicans as a result of its decision to purchase 64 megawatts of nuclear power from the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station in Arizona. It is seeking as much as a 15 percent bump in customer bills to cover the cost of the acquisition. Bernalillo County, the state Attorney General's Office and several other parties oppose such a steep rate increase. \But because Facebook has agreed to pay all costs for renewable energy associated with the proposed data center, including the additional 115 kilovolt burden that the facility will place on PNM's power grid, the utility seems to have had a change of heart. \The state currently requires that 15 percent of energy generation come from renewable sources, with a goal of carbon neutrality by 2040. The new facility, the PRC application notes, will allow the company to exceed its renewable energy requirements. \PNM has slowly been adding renewable sources to its energy portfolio. It added 40 megawatts of solar power in 2015. And in January, it showcased a gleaming farm of 40,000 solar panels just south of Santa Fe, capable of producing 9.5 megawatts per year. That project alone employed 300 workers at a cost of $20 million. \New Mexico was recently ranked sixth in the nation for collective solar capacity per capita based on 2014 data, according to a report by Environment New Mexico. But solar supporters like Wheeler say the state's capacity for solar is so vast it could power every home and building, with the potential to outpace coal power. \Still many in the state have raised concerns about the cost of solar power. Extension of a popular solar tax credit set to expire this year was vetoed by Gov. Susana Martinez last year, and measures failed to reach the House or Senate floor during this year's legislative session. Several Republican state House members raised concerns about net metering, saying the cost of solar would fall unfairly on non-solar customers, who would have to take on the energy costs that solar customers were saving. \Tom Manning, director of Citizens for Fair Rates and the Environment, an advocacy group involved in the current PNM rate case, said PNM's interest in the Facebook deal should extend to home and smaller business applications for solar power. \""What these agreements show is that through building renewable energy plants, PNM is then able to offer lower rates [to customers],"" he said in an email. ""Shouldn't we apply this concept in ways that would benefit us all, not just a few large customers?""\Credit: Rebecca Moss The New Mexican"
236,"The annual Homes of Enchantment Parade is a free ""must-do"" for anyone whose idea of a fun afternoon is looking at someone else's home. \In this case, however, the fun lasts for three weekends. \The 18th annual parade, sponsored by the Home Builders Association of Central New Mexico, is an ""open house"" to beat all others. The largest event of its kind in New Mexico, it offers parade-goers a free look at 80 new homes, four remodels and a masterplanned community with a decidedly green emphasis. \The homes are scattered in Albuquerque, Los Lunas, Corrales, the East Mountains, Placitas, Rio Rancho and Bernalillo. \The popular self-guided parade runs from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. today and Oct. 17-19 and 24-26. While paradegoers enjoy seeing the latest in construction methods, materials, home dcor and energy-efficient appliances, the hard work pays off for builders, too, as they compete for awards given by their peers. \Awards are given in these categories and at various price points: Best Kitchen, Best Master Bath, Best Remodel, Buyer's Choice, Universal Design and Urban Revitalization. The land value is subtracted from the sales price of the home to determine the price categories for judging, so homes with similar construction costs compete against each other. \""It's a chance for buyers to have a face-to-face conversation with some of the top builders in the metro area,"" says Dianne Wynne Hruschka of the Home Builders Association. ""There are opportunities to talk to builders about what sets them apart and to see the quality craftsmanship that the builder is capable of."" \Many of the parade homes are for sale and have been furnished for the parade weekends. Viewers can set their own pace to study furniture trends, countertop materials, fireplaces, water features, outdoor kitchens, plaster products and flooring. It's a chance to walk through a variety of affordable production homes or the million-dollar places not typically open to the public. \Eighteen homes have been entered in the Universal Design competition and incorporate features such as wider doorways or hallways to provide accessibility for people of all age groups and abilities. \Feature homes \Each year, two residences are designated as feature homes. This year, the honor is shared by a custom builder and a production builder. \The custom home, by O.L. Smith Contracting, is in the all-green La Cuentista neighborhood on the mesa above Petroglyph National Monument. \Smith specializes in modern Southwestern homes with clean architectural lines, open floor plans and, in this case, a Euro-style kitchen with sleek dark cabinets and glass. \This feature home, designed by Krupnick Studio, is at 8124 Cayenne Drive NW and carries a $525,000 price tag. Like all homes in La Cuentista, it meets certification standards from Build Green NM for energy efficiency. \The second featured home is a two-story, $393,990 family home by production builder D.R. Horton Homes in the Las Brisas neighborhood within the masterplanned Cabezon community in Rio Rancho. \This is one of D.R. Horton's mid- to higher-range homes, and a particular favorite with buyers. The Scottsdale-style home is roomy enough for both formal and informal living and dining spaces, and boasts a spacious family area on the secondfloor landing. This home shows off the builder's upgrade package. \While D.R. Horton will have all its model homes at Cabazon open during the parade, one is noteworthy as not only the most affordable home in the parade at $182,570, but also as a fundraiser for El Ranchito de los Nios. The program provides a longterm home for children in need. \The one-story, 1,421-square-foot home at 2704 Violetta Circle SE in Cabazon's Toscana neighborhood is being raffled Nov. 16. Tickets sales, priced at $75 apiece, will be limited to 4,000 buyers. For information, visit losninosnm.org. \High Desert custom \On the other end of the price spectrum is the parade's most expensive entry this year. \At $4 million, the custom home at 8504 Snakedance Court NE in High Desert backs up against U.S. Forest Service property and offers spectacular outdoor living spaces and views to the mountains and the city. \The home has 8,700 square feet of heated space, and an additional 3,000 square feet of covered outdoor living space. \A highly colorful home, it has it all -- home theater with a fiber optics ceiling, billiards room, playroom for the kids, outdoor balconies, a study loft, guest suite and more. The builder is Altair Homes and the home is sold. \Altair Homes offers another parade entry at 2 Old Rail Pass in the East Mountains' San Pedro Overlook. This one is a solar home, giving visitors a chance to see an active rooftop photovoltaic system as it generates electricity. \Another extensively green home in the parade is the Sun Mountain Construction home at 64 Victor Road on the southern end of Corrales. \This almost 4,000-squarefoot home features a net metering system that enables homeowners to ""sell back"" surplus electricity to Public Service Company of New Mexico. Local solar company Sunergy Inc. will be on hand with a solar collector display set up in the garage. \This $1.4 million home features innovative mechanical systems and timbers harvested from dead, standing forests. \The signature community honors go to Loma Colorado in Rio Rancho. This 433-acre master-planned community, developed and built exclusively by national production builder Pulte Homes, is noteworthy for its commitment to ensuring that every home in the development has a guaranteed annual energy usage. \All homes -- and they run the gamut from the $170,000s to nearly $400,000 -- are green-certified according to standards set by Build Green NM, Energy Star and Environments for Living.

237," Ten reasons why to reject new convention center\ There are problems with the proposed convention center, as several people have written in letters to the editor.\ 1. Santa Fe is doing great without it. The convention center is a solution in search of a problem.\ 2. Would destroy downtown Santa Fe. Convention in town: Packed hotels, restaurants and streets; service trucks at all hours; hordes of garish people. No convention in town: Ghost town.\ 3. Is a taxpayer subsidy to business.\ 4. City should stick to providing basic services.\ 5. Hotels could build it themselves through a joint venture. Or one hotel could build it and charge higher fees to conventioneers registered at competing hotels.\ 6. Sweeney already serves as a civic center and could be expanded.\ 7. Conventioneers will drive up prices at restaurants and shops.\ 8. No net increase in economic activity. Repaying the bonds through increased lodger's tax simply deducts money from somewhere else.\ 9. No guarantee the bond market will be interested in buying the bonds. City could be stuck with the construction bill.\ 10. Giant construction project in the middle of town for at least two years.\ You can guess my opinion of this issue convention center.\ Joe Almanzar\ Santa Fe\ Richardson refreshing\ Our former congressman and current energy secretary, Bill Richardson was quoted as saying that he had voted in the past for the NRA and against gun-control legislation.\ ""Maybe I was voting too much with my constituents, and not with what was right."" A refreshing mea culpa and a sly dig at our New Mexico macho hunters.\ Compare this with Al Gore's refreshing version of the Buddist Temple fiasco. Picking Richardson from Gore's short list of vice presidential candidates, would, I think, strengthen the ticket.\ Woodford Dulaney\ Santa Fe\ Circus of horrors\ The Sterling and Reid Circus is coming to Santa Fe at the end of April. Why? Because the public likes to see performing animals -- especially exotic animals -- and if they happen to be beaten to make them perform -- hey, they're ""just"" animals, after all.\ The tragedy is that people either don't realize or don't care about the abuse that goes on behind the scenes, which is carefully hidden from them in the glitzy, colorful performance arena.\ Circus animals have been ripped from their natural environments and family groups, ""broken"" with chains and whips, forced to live a life mostly on the road in cramped, filthy railroad cars, imprisoned in cages that are too small, left in the sun to overheat or in the cold to freeze, and given inadequate nutrition and veterinary care, among other horrors.\ Ardeth D. Baxter\ Santa Fe\ Empty sum\ Now Gore and Bush will be the only serious contenders for the White House.\ Nothing plus nothing still adds up to zero.\ Pray for the Republic.\ Scott Abbott\ Santa Fe\ No coercion\ To parents concerned about Impact World Tour and its Christian message, I was present at three of the four meetings held recently at Capital and Santa Fe High School and did not observe any coercion or anyone being accosted.\ Deanna Petty\ Glorieta\ Chutzpah\ What nerve -- the Catholic Church expects a pardon for centuries of massacres, flayings, slayings, inquisitions, murders, pedophilia - - puh-leez!\ Kudos to the woman who would not accept Sheehan's apology.\ The church's so-called apology reminds me of the fellow who murders his parents and throws himself on the mercy of the court because he's an orphan!\ The church should put its money where its mouth is: scholarships for women, return of property to the Jews, return of nobility of our sovereign Native American nations; housing assistance for black families. Then I would think an apology was real. As for the pedophile priests -- they should be sent to Mozambique to rebuild it - - not to Jemez Springs for rehabilitation.\ Irene Hastings\ Santa Fe\ More on abortion\ Misinformed abortion supporters like letter writer J. Campbell believe the fetus is ""part of a woman's body."" This is not only bad science, it's bad logic.\ It's bad science because science proves that life begins at conception. The child has different DNA from his mother so he cannot be part of her body.\ It's bad logic because even if the baby were part of his mother, that still wouldn't justify abortion. After all, we don't allow women or men to mutilate their own bodies.\ The pro-abortion crowd needs to stop pretending that abortion is no big deal. It's a very big deal to the women who have been hurt by it.\ Michael Herrick\ Santa Fe\ Double standard\ PNM's recent attempt to blame environmentalists for the recent state-wide power failure is nonsensical at best and at worst reveals their mastery of the art of the double standard.\ For example: In the net metering rule recently enacted by the Public Regulation Commission, the connecting utility requires that anyone who intends to install a small (10kW) solar-electric home generating system must ""bear the proportionate cost of any loss, damage, expense and liability attributable to that party's negligence.""\ Such language clearly mandates that the small electricity generator is fully liable for any losses the utility might incur, yet when PNM's generation system tanked, PNM officials quickly shifted the liability to enviros for preventing PNM from building more power lines.\ Excuse me, the enviros have, for decades, have been badgering PNM to pursue energy efficiency and cogeneration and diversification of its energy-generation sources. More recently, the enviros have advocated locally sited microturbines and fuel cells that render long- distance transmission lines unnecessary.\ PNM's continued reliance on obsolete coal and nuclear power plants located at great distances from load centers (where the power is used) require long, unsightly and vulnerable transmission lines. Worse, only 25 percent of the energy in the fuel ever reaches the customer due to thermal and transmission losses. Locally sited generation, e.g. microturbines and residential fuel cells, can deliver energy with 80 percent efficiency and require no long- distance transmission lines.\ PNM's steadfast refusal to embrace energy conservation, cogeneration and locally-sited clean power generation is at fault here, not the environmentalists.\ Charles Bensinger\ president\ New World Energy Systems\ Santa Fe\ Grateful, amazed\ I went to the recent reconciliation service at the Cathedral. I felt I had to be there. I heard Archbishop Sheehan ask God's forgiveness for what the Church has done and failed to do that has caused such enormous harm.\ Afterward, I thanked him and shook his hand. I never thought I would see the day when a priest, let alone an archbishop, or unbelievably -- the Pope himself -- would seek reconciliation with the Jews. But that day has come.\ Reconciliation will take time and serious mutual concern. Letter writer Charlotte Levin -- and others who are not ready to approach forgiveness or who think peace ought not be attempted with one's enemies -- may be cheered by recent Jerusalem Post reports. During the Pope's visit to Bethlehem and a refugee camp, the Israeli government expressed acceptance of Yassir Arafat's actions and statements, even his claiming Jerusalem as the ""eternal capital of Palestine."" These are known Palestinian positions, the government said; they require no particular rebuttal now.\ Despite the unfortunate fact that there are indeed some self- loathing Jews -- at the other end of the spectrum -- who would give the whole farm away, we need not worry that Israel will self- immolate.\ Ms. Levin does not remotely speak for all ""us Jews"" and there are indeed vast numbers of us today who -- witnessing the Church's historic steps and Israel's reaction -- are both deeply grateful and totally amazed.\ David Pfeffer\ Santa Fe"
238,"The Solar Energy Improvement Special Assessment Act, sponsored by State Senator Peter Wirth and State Representative Brian Egolf, is exciting new legislation that will make green improvements accessible to all homeowners. The idea of living off the grid is no longer an alternative lifestyle. It's becoming a mainstream concept as we see not only the green initiatives implemented by the Obama administration but hear our kids discussing our ""carbon footprint"" around the dinner table. Previously the cost of adding a solar energy system to a home was prohibitive and while many longed for a way to get off the grid and contribute to cleaner energy, we were tied to coal-fired power plants and big oil. I am thrilled to say that is coming to an end.\A residential photovoltaic system can create significant financial savings while helping to minimize the tons of carbon dioxide and other pollutants created by traditional power plants. Modern systems operate automatically by switching between the utility company's power and solar power. These systems are designed to cover 10, 50, or 100 percent of your household electrical usage. PNM has a net metering program so you could produce surplus energy to offset the energy you have already used. What sweet satisfaction to see the utility dial that normally counts kilowatt hours spinning backwards, representing credit earned towards future bills.\A solar thermal system is typically a solar hot-water system sized to heat enough hot water used by a household on any given day. But larger applications are possible given the radiant heat so popular in today's homes. Imagine the savings when the heat running underneath your feet in winter is primarily generated by the sun overhead. Imagine the positive impact on our environment when the need for propane and natural gas becomes secondary. Imagine the industry created by the development and installation of photovoltaic and solar-thermal systems all over Santa Fe.\Let's say a new PV system costs a homeowner $20,000. Most people do not have the capital to invest and must find financing. While home-equity loans are possible, a 10-year note could still make the expense greater than the benefit on a short-term basis. House Bill 572 allows for financing to be procured through a special program at the county level, with a favorable interest rate and terms, and that loan will be tied to the property by a special assessment. Repayment will be in much the same manner as one pays one's property taxes. In the event the house is sold, the new owner who has the advantage of the solar-energy system would continue to pay the assessment. This incentive combined with the 30 percent tax credit offered at the federal level for new solar installations makes solar accessible for us all. \While the details at the county level are still being worked out, this is landmark legislation. Santa Fe, with its emphasis on preservation and sustainability, could be a new leader on green initiatives with its new building codes and policies. We've been at the forefront before with the development of Eldorado, the first solar community in the U.S. Let's lead the nation again and make Santa Fe an example all cities can follow for using its biggest attribute, our sunshine, in creating new jobs, new energy, and a new way of life. \Melissa Pippin-Carson is an associate broker with Sotheby's International Realty.

240," As much of the rest of the country struggles to find reliable, affordable sources of electricity, we here in New Mexico are sitting on enormous - but largely untapped - clean, affordable, reliable and renewable-energy resources.\ According to energy experts, New Mexico has among the greatest potential for renewable energy in the nation. Our solar energy resources are second in the nation; our geothermal resources are third; and our wind potential is 12th. Whether we tap these sources depends on the outcome of energy legislation now before Congress.\ Sens. Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici are in key positions to affect the content of the energy bill and will decide whether it continues to subsidize old, polluting forms of energy or helps grow renewable-energy resources.\ Why is renewable energy so important to us here New Mexico? The answer is simple: Developing New Mexico's renewable-electricity resources benefits the state's economy, environment, health and security.\ The Pacific Northwest National Labs, a division of the Department of Energy, conservatively estimated New Mexico's wind-energy potential at 48 billion-kilowatt hours per year - three times the total energy consumed in the state annually.\ According to a recent study done by Princeton University, solar panels on 20 percent of New Mexico's landmass could displace all the coal, oil and gas the entire United States uses each year.\ In other words, New Mexico could play a central role in the generation of renewable energy - and that means more money flowing into the state and more jobs for New Mexicans.\ In addition to those directly involved in the renewable-energy industry, ranchers can reap enormous economic benefits by leasing their land for energy production, as well as for wind farms in eastern New Mexico.\ As for the consumer - wouldn't it be nice not to have to worry about those natural-gas price spikes raising the heating bill every winter?\ One look at the effects of our current methods of producing energy is enough to convince us that transitioning to cleaner methods now is vitally important.\ In New Mexico alone, an estimated 33,165,226 tons of five harmful pollutants are released into the air every year by the state's four coal-burning plants.\ They include particulate matter, mercury and smog- and soot- forming nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. These pollutants can pose serious health risks, especially to children and the elderly.\ According to the American Lung Association, 93,000 New Mexicans suffer from asthma made worse as a result of power-plant pollution. Government warnings have also been issued against eating fish from 26 lakes and streams in New Mexico because of mercury contamination.\ In a state whose potential to harvest clean energy is almost unparalleled, there is no good reason to tolerate this completely avoidable source of pollution.\ Having renewable domestic-energy sources will also mean we are no longer held hostage by our dependency on oil from foreign countries.\ According to the Department of Energy, the United States uses nearly 20 million barrels a day of oil - and imports 55 percent of it.\ By 2013, DOE estimates we will use over 24 million barrels a day and import 63 percent of it. Sticking with the status quo will mean our reliance on foreign oil will grow; shifting to renewable energy will make us less dependent on unstable regions of the world for our energy.\ The legislative tool that has been proposed to encourage the development of renewable-energy technologies is called a Renewable Portfolio Standard. An RPS requires that utilities produce a certain percentage of their power from renewable sources such as solar and wind.\ A recent poll showed that 84 percent of New Mexicans support an RPS, and we have led the way by establishing an RPS here of 10 percent by 2011.\ Nationally, an RPS has already been passed in the Senate twice. However, whether or not an RPS will be included in the final version of the energy bill - now in conference committee to hammer out a compromise between the House and Senate versions - depends on whether our representatives in Washington stay true to what New Mexicans have already said we want.\ Investing in renewable energy means more jobs for New Mexicans, less pollution in our beautiful state and less dependency on foreign oil. It's a no brainer.\ Gregory Green represents both the National Environmental Trust and the Union of Concerned Scientists."
241," ACTIONS ON ENERGY BRING HOPE AND BENEFITS\ Gov. Bill Richardson's recent endorsement of New Mexico's Renewable Portfolio Standard, which requires investor-owned utilities to provide 10 percent renewable energy in their power mix by 2011, is a crucial and momentous development for the progress of renewable energy in our state, and, in fact, the United States as a whole. His endorsement will allow our attorney general and the secretary of energy to defend the RPS against a challenge in State Supreme Court by El Paso Electric. Significantly, no New Mexico- based utility has challenged the RPS.\ Indeed, Gov. Richardson's proactive stance on this and other energy related issues supporting the cancellation of the Fence Lake coal mine, opposing drilling in Otero Mesa, his overall renewable- energy plan, and his support for publicly funded PRC elections have revolutionized the prospects for clean energy in our state.\ The benefits of the RPS, in particular, are many: It will greatly diversify power generation in our region, both in terms of location and generation type, and thereby ultimately improve the stability of the grid while insulating consumers from rate hikes that are likely to result from increased restrictions on emissions of pollutants such as mercury and carbon dioxide. The RPS will also have enormous direct environmental and economic benefits, bringing tens to hundreds of millions of dollars to our rural communities, while simultaneously eliminating several million tons of carbon-dioxide emissions each year -- the primary cause of global warming.\ Ben Luce\ chairman\ Coalition for Clean Affordable Energy\ president\ New Mexico Solar Energy Association\ Los Alamos\ Road extension\ Approval of the first step in the Siler Road extension project is up for consideration by the City Council. As a deeply concerned citizen, the project has my unequivocal support.\ Having lived for the past two years on West Alameda Street, I have witnessed the extreme need our growing city has for appropriate connecting arteries between main city streets and highways. I have observed the dangerous backwash onto inappropriate, rural, dirt roads such as Camino Carlos Rael. It was on Camino Carlos Rael that I saw a young boy, probably 9 years old, almost hit head-on by a utility truck.\ Since then, I decided I would do whatever I could to bring the dangers of the inappropriate use of rural neighborhood roads as throughways for heavy city traffic to the attention of city planners. Thus, this plea to the City Council to prioritize traffic planning and funding now -- for the sake of preventing an accident on Camino Carlos Rael and other, similar neighborhood roads before they happen: It is not a matter of if; it is a matter of when.\ Jennifer Stamm\ Santa Fe\ Thanks from SFO\ With the reconstruction of U.S. 84/285 under way, The Santa Fe Opera had the potential for long traffic delays and reduced ticket sales this summer. Happily, neither came to pass.\ On behalf of the opera, I would like to thank everyone who worked so hard to ensure our patrons' safe and efficient travel: Gov. Bill Richardson and his staff; the New Mexico State Highway Department, Robert Bency, project manager; New Mexico Department of Public Safety, John Wheeler; District One, New Mexico State Police, Lt. Manuel Gutierrez; and FNS Construction, Bruce Victory, project manager.\ I would also like to thank the audience for its foresight in arriving early and patience in departing after the performances. We were delighted to see so many bringing picnics and enjoying the sunsets or attending one of the lectures. Thanks to their support, we achieved our ticket-sales goal for the season, and our financial outlook is guardedly optimistic.\ My colleagues and I look forward to welcoming everyone back next season.\ Richard Gaddes\ general director\ The Santa Fe Opera\ Protecting Israelis\ The recent bus bombing in Israel has been condemned by many, and rightly so. Such attacks are barbaric. Here is my suggestion on how to end them: The United States should give the Palestinians Apache gunships with laser-guided Hell-Fire missiles, matching the weapons we have given to Israel. I'm sure that given the armaments to attack Israel's leaders with improved precision, they would gladly forswear bus bombings.\ We tend to use the tools at hand for the problem before us. I suggest that with better tools (weapons) the Palestinians would be more ""civilized"" in their practices. It might also move Ariel Sharon to the peace table.\ Cathie Sullivan\ Santa Fe\ When in Rome...\ Samuel Thompson wrote, ""I don't believe in Santa Claus, but I'm not going to sue somebody for singing a Ho-Ho-Ho song in December."" I don't agree with Darwin, but I didn't go out and hire a lawyer when my high-school teacher taught his theory of evolution.\ Life, liberty and pursuit of happiness will not be endangered because someone says a 30-second prayer before a football game. So what's the big deal? It's not like somebody is up there reading the entire Book of Acts. They're just talking to a God they believe in and asking him to grant safety to the players on the field and the fans going home from the game.\ ""But it's a Christian prayer,"" some will argue. Yes, and this is the United States of America, a country founded on Christian principles. And we are in the Bible Belt. According to our very own phone book, Christian churches outnumber all others better than 200- to-1. So what would you expect -- somebody chanting Hare Krishna?\ If I went to a football game in Jerusalem, I would expect to hear a Jewish prayer. If I went to a soccer game in Baghdad, I would expect to hear a Muslim prayer. If I went to a ping-pong match in China, I would expect to hear someone pray to Buddha. And I wouldn't be offended. It wouldn't bother me one bit.\ Bernadette\ Pesenti-Valdes\ Santa Fe\ Kids and grandkids\ Two issues are being neglected in discussions of whether or not to accelerate distributions from the Land Grant Permanent Fund in order to improve New Mexico's school systems.\ First, opponents of increasing the rate of withdrawal from the fund claim we should not benefit our children at the expense of our grandchildren. I agree, but it is equally true that we should not be so conservative in spending proceeds of the fund that we cheat our children in order to assure benefits to our grandchildren.\ Second, if we have too many children, and they produce too many grandchildren, we will never have enough money to optimize our school systems and meet the needs of future generations.\ James A. Bailey\ Santa Fe\ Perspective\ The responses to an anti-France piece did not note historical inaccuracies in that piece.\ The invasion of France by Germany in 1939 did not precipitate the entry of the United States into the conflict. At that time, the United States made a formal commitment of neutrality. The United States did not immediately come to the aid of France. And it was not the United States declaring war on Germany in order to save the French. The United States was drawn into the conflict when Nazi Germany declared war on the United States -- and not the United States declaring war on Germany.\ The ""rescue"" of France was not a noble deed, and France was liberated over five years after it was subjected to the Nazi yoke. France was liberated as an indirect consequence of the Allied invasion of Europe to crush the Nazis. It was necessary to invade through France in order to defeat the Nazis. If there was a better way to prosecute the war, the United States would have forgone the liberation of France.\ Let it also be recognized that the Marshall Plan was not a case of ""generosity"" on the part of the United States. The Marshall Plan was instituted to try to prevent all of Europe from coming under the communist yoke. The Marshall Plan was quite a selfish act on the part of the American government at that time.\ Note also that France was not as devastated by WWII as other countries and did not receive the bulk of Marshall Plan aid. Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria and Germany received the most aid.\ Jim Clayton\ Arroyo Hondo\ Still dreaming\ The New Mexican issued on the 40th anniversary of the Aug. 28, 1963, March On Washington for Jobs and Freedom was in a position to be a observer of the current conditions of America today and to be the official public record of whether things have finally changed or whether they have slid backward. The march is where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous speech, ""I have a dream""; it was the awakening of the American consciousness to racism, civil rights, unemployment, social justice, poverty and the disparity between rich and poor, voting rights, freedom of speech, health-care access and educational opportunities.\ So what has changed, really? I believe we have regressed. We have that same poverty -- the disparity between rich and poor is the greatest ever -- the highest unemployment since 1991, poor health- care access and a undeclared, unwinnable war against a guerrilla force in Iraq where 80 percent of the force are poor black, Hispanic and white kids.\ People in the United States need to wake up and march in the streets again. Let the ""dream"" be pursued every day and in every way.\ William H. Mee\ Santa Fe\ Energy bill, WIPP\ Thank you for your excellent editorial last month opposing Sen. Pete Domenici's section 310 of the energy bill, which would take away New Mexico's oversight of WIPP. Domenici obviously does not have the health of New Mexico's citizens and the safety of our environment as his priority.\ New Mexico officials agreed to WIPP's location in this state on the condition that the state's Environment Department would have regulatory oversight.\ If Congress takes away New Mexico's oversight, it will be a serious breach of contract, and the NMED will have the right to withdraw the permit -- and the people will have the right to demand WIPP's closing.\ Penelope McMullen, SL\ Loretto Community\ Santa Fe"

The price of everything is going up and much of the increase can be traced back to energy costs. With unemployment high and the economy threatening a double dip, wouldn't you think our elected officials would be doing everything possible to cut energy costs and, therefore, lower prices to help ease the pain the public is feeling? Not!In 2007, New Mexico's legislators, led by Senate Majority Leader Michael Sanchez, voted for mandatory renewable energy standards - called an RPS for Renewable Portfolio Standards. The RPS requires that an increasing percentage of the state's electricity come from renewable sources - primarily wind and solar - by set dates: 15 percent by 2015, 20 percent by 2020. Like New Mexico, most states voted in their RPS back when the economy was thriving and ""green"" energy sounded like a good idea - after all the wind and the sun are free. Voting against renewables was akin to not liking puppies. Elected officials from both parties voted for the RPS. We now know that while the wind blows and the sun shines, converting them to electricity is espensive - even in a state like New Mexico with an abundance of both. We also know that with the troubled economy, no one wants more expensive energy - especially if there are questions about how green it really is. We need to repeal the RPS mandates that sounded so attractive just a few years ago.In New Mexico, a citizen working group has spent the last ten months in meetings with PNM - the primary state utility company. The goal: to produce a report - as required by the Public Regulatory Commission - that outlines how the company plans to meet the state's RPS. That report was delivered to the PRC on Monday, July 18. The 236 page document can be summed up in three simple words: more expensive electricity. Many different computer models were run to determine the least-cost way to meet the mandates. The results should not be surprising. The least-cost model was based on coal - but it does not meet the mandates. The least-cost that does meet the mandates requires the addition of wind, solar, and gas-fueled power plants and shuts down some of the older, existing, fully-functional, coal-fueled power plants. The model favored by advocates of green energy cuts out coal all together and requires the building of new gas-fueled plants for base load power and to back up the renewables. This third model is the most expensive and therefore is unlikely to be selected by the PRC. But even the mid-range plan will cost New Mexicans more than a billion dollars - and this is just for required CO2 penalties, not the actual power plant capital costs. That increase will be felt in everything and disproportionally hurts the poor. Not to mention the increased costs to the cities within the state who are trying to balance their budgets while keeping the lights on.Coal and nuclear were found to be the lowest cost energy generating systems available, yet they are not in PNM's portfolio for the foreseeable future. The report states that renewable energy systems are expensive, yet they are in the plan. It is bad enough that New Mexico has to deal with the rising costs forced on us from the federal level - such as the EPA's Best Available Retrofit Technology regulations, but to have our own local legislators vote for higher energy costs that will kill the economic climate in New Mexico is baffling.Once these plans are approved by the PRC and the plants are built, we will see a huge jump in our bills - but by then, when people become outraged, it will be too late. If PNM is required to implement this plan, they rightly will need to recoup their costs and there will be a rate increase. The time to fight such increases is now, when the report makes the higher costs clear - right there in black and white (and color).The governor needs to call a special session to deal with the facts. The legislators need to know that you want the RPS (SB 418, passed in 2007) repealed before it is too late. Call the governor. Call your senator and state representative - if you do not know who they are, www.nmlegis.gov has an easy search feature that will give you the names and with one click, contact information for each.

243," It's certainly not something you hear about every day: government, environmentalists, utilities, industry and ranchers working together on a single issue.\ Yet that's what happened with the state of New Mexico's latest law on renewable-energy development, Gov. Bill Richardson said Thursday during a ceremony celebrating the passage of several green legislative initiatives at the Randall Davey Audubon Center.\ ""I think with responsible partnerships, we can have it all,"" Richardson said. ""We can have a prosperous economy. We can have sensible development. We can protect the environment, and we can have jobs.""\ First on the list of bills signed into law was a provision requiring utilities in New Mexico to produce 10 percent of their energy through renewable sources by 2011. The Public Regulation Commission passed a similar requirement -- dubbed a ""renewable- portfolio standard"" -- in December 2002, but elevating the provision to state law makes court challenges moot.\ The new law also allows utilities to create green-power programs that allow individual customers to buy -- and sell -- renewable energy at a premium price, said Ben Luce, chairman of the New Mexico Coalition for Clean Affordable Energy. ""This opens the door to the creation of a huge green-power market that will be above and beyond the RPS (renewable-energy portfolio).""\ The governor also signed bills that create tax incentives for people who buy energy-efficient vehicles and support renewable energy development. One measure allocates about $200,000 for efforts to spur and organize hydrogen research and development and another $500,000 for renewable energy-saving upgrades to state buildings, schools and nonprofit organizations.\ Chris Wentz, who heads up conservation efforts for the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, said the Legislature also appropriated about $2.6 million out of the governor's budget for energy upgrades at state and school buildings. The governor had requested $6 million.\ Not all of the bills advanced as part of the governor's green energy package were successful.\ In particular, a bill that would have created a bonding mechanism to promote energy-efficiency upgrades -- which pay for themselves in lower utility bills -- died without a vote as the session ended. Advocates and state officials plan to return with that bill next year.\ Also Thursday, Richardson discussed several initiatives to expand and improve the state park system: $2 million to establish and run the Mesilla Valley Bosque Park in Dona Ana County; $3.5 million to purchase 111 acres of ranchland on the west side of Albuquerque and eventually incorporate that land into the Rio Grande State Park; and $1.7 million for new land acquisitions.\ ""Amazingly, the State Parks department has not bought an acre of land since 1986,"" said State Parks Director David Simon. ""Under this governor, that is about to change."""

Gas prices remain below $2 a gallon in most of New Mexico, providing citizens of our state with extra cash for their winter fun. Don't get used to it. The Environmental Protection Agency is in the process of implementing three rules that a new study by the Rio Grande Foundation and Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University says will substantially drive up the cost of electricity in New Mexico.
\
This comes on top of recent, dramatic increases in electricity prices, thanks in part to New Mexico's aggressive renewable portfolio standard (RPS). With the state's largest utility, PNM, looking for a 12 percent rate hike, the RPS forcing utilities to purchase more costly renewables, and the Obama administration's proposed regulations, electricity rate hikes faced by New Mexicans are only just beginning.
\
Of course all New Mexicans want a clean environment; most appreciate the EPA's intentions. Nonetheless, it's clear that with the exception of a radical fringe, few are clamoring for new federal regulations that threaten the state's struggling economy.
\
By any measure, New Mexico's air is in great shape. According to the American Lung Association's 2013 ""State of the Air"" report, three New Mexico cities, Santa Fe, Farmington and Albuquerque, rank among the 10 cleanest nationwide in terms of particulate pollution. Farmington ranked fifth-cleanest despite being downwind of two of New Mexico's major coal-fired power plants.
\
Apparently that isn't good enough for this EPA. Recently, it dictated three major rules on emissions -- one on mercury and two on carbon dioxide -- that will increase the price of electricity in New Mexico by 18 percent by 2030, according to the economists who conducted the study.
\
That's bad news for commercial and residential rate-payers alike.
\
The rules especially target New Mexico's coal plants, which produce 68 percent of the state's electricity, and the bulk of base load electricity to the nation's electric grids. The rule mandates existing coal plants reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by at least 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.
\
To comply with this mandate, the state's coal plants will be forced to adopt expensive and unproven new carbon capture technology. This will obviously have a devastating impact on the state's 1,583 workers who work directly in the coal industry. These are well-paying, often unionized jobs.
\
And the study's economists highlight how the employment impact will spread far beyond mining. They forecast that under the rule, 5,170 jobs will be lost in New Mexico by 2030, a number that includes those from other sectors which service the coal industry. In other words, this proposal impacts both the truck driver who gets the coal to the furnace and the chef making green chile cheeseburgers for his lunch.
\
Even the EPA estimates that these new regulations will cost over $50 billion nationally. But it justifies this cost by claiming that they will provide tens of billions of dollars in benefits that will more than offset these costs. The vast majority of these benefits come in the form of improved health.
\
Quantifying tens of billions of dollars in health improvements is a difficult task at best and a fool's errand at worst. The EPA has drawn widespread criticism for its use of secret science and stretched assumptions to come up with such a forecast. For example, economists at the Beacon Hill Institute criticize the benefit assessments for incorporating the reduction of particulate matter, which is already regulated under different EPA rules.
\
Clean air is a worthy goal, something which New Mexicans are lucky to have along with reliable electricity produced by coal. But as this study indicates, wringing the last few pollution particles out of the atmosphere comes at a cost that is too steep for New Mexicans.

246,"This year, Las Cruces is focused on a bold goal: the city is aiming to be 80-percent energy self-sufficient by 2050 and net-zero in energy usage by 2070.\This isn't just talk. Las Cruces is making serious progress in driving solar projects and efficiency improvements, and, last year, the city became the first in New Mexico to receive a nationally recognized rating for sustainability.\We all know these are good moves for improving air quality and cutting emissions. But the biggest advantages of green energy are actually for our economy. By expanding solar, wind and energy efficiency, Las Cruces can cut consumers' electricity costs and create jobs.\As solar prices have fallen dramatically — to half what they were in 2008 and one one-hundredth of what they were in 1978 — New Mexico's generation capacity has grown tremendously. There's now enough solar in our state to power 83,000 homes. The growth of the industry has meant the creation of 1,900 new high-quality jobs statewide. It's also created considerable new savings for ratepayers and bolstered home values — all while offsetting some of the pollution caused by burning coal.\This is why people across the political spectrum support green energy. According to a recent study, 91 percent of Americans believe we should be speeding up our transition toward clean power as a means to protect the planet, save money and spur innovation. But, in New Mexico, we've still got serious work ahead of us. We're still getting less than 5 percent of our power from solar. And some out-of-state special interest groups are actually fighting to stop the growth of green energy.\Right now, New Mexico's political leaders need to commit to simple, popular, and cost-effective policies to enable our region's green growth. There are three policies in particular that can make the difference:\The first is called ""net metering."" Under this popular program, New Mexico residents can generate their own power and get credit for what they share with the grid for others to use. By supporting net metering, New Mexico's elected officials can promote the growth of solar and ensure that homeowners who generate electricity can use it when they need it.\The second is the state residential tax credit — a cost-effective program that has enabled more than 5,500 New Mexico households to go solar and leveraged about $30 million in private sector investment. Across America, renewables receive only a small fraction of the subsidies that fossil fuels receive. By reinstating these lapsed credits, the Legislature and government can enable the state to meet its energy goals while helping homeowners save money and boost property values.\The third way elected officials can help our green transition is by expanding our state's Renewable Portfolio Standard. Recent polling has found that 80 percent of Americans, including strong majorities of conservative Republicans, support requiring utilities like PNM to generate more clean power. New Mexico's RPS is already creating a cleaner environment and a more competitive economy. But we can do better. California's ambitious renewable standard (50 percent clean energy by 2030) has so far created an estimated 25,500 annual construction jobs as well as thousands of other well-paying jobs in transportation, administration and finance.\New Mexico has a thousand times more renewable energy potential than we actually need to power our homes and businesses.

On March 23, 2011, I read in the ""Two Cents"" section about the economies silent killer.
\
The story would have you believe the RPS (Renewable Portfolio Standard) would cause inflated energy costs therefore causing public and private job losses.
\
I tried to look at EnergyMakesAmericanGreat.org to see who sponsors financially this organization so that we might know who funds their work. About 95% of their money comes from undisclosed Grants.
\
I would want to know if undue influence is being exerted by establishment energy providers like coal and oil.
\
Rivers and streams have been dammed up to provide energy at a cost to wildlife, established communities, and our environment. But, the greater good for the public was served by spending the resources and providing many thousands of jobs for decades.
\
In New Mexico, burning coal provides the majority of the non-renewable fuel for our energy needs. How much more of this acid rain producing dirty fuel can we afford as it becomes scarce?
\
Is there any doubt clean renewable energy s preferable to a dirty finite fuel?
\
Is it given that renewable cost more in the short term, but less in the long term? Yes!
\
Is the greater good served by requiring utilities to increase the percentage of their state's electricity portfolio? Yes!
\
How much farther will our resources go if our peak energy demands are supplied by renewables?
\
We can use conventional power to supply our needs at night when demands are down.
\
If electric cars are the future and gas burners emitting CO2 (carbon) are going out as fuel prices rise to the stars we need to consider renewable energy to power those vehicles.
\
Developing and expanding the renewable energy industry where it is now (10-15%) to what it can become means jobs at energy level and skill set.
\
My experience with solar renewable is that the break-even point is at 7-8 years on equipment that lasts 20-plus years (that means 13 or more year of income). Does that sound like a ""silent killer"" to you?

We all expect to pay a price for missing deadlines -- but not the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
\
For the past two years, the EPA has failed to meet the deadline under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), requiring the agency to tell refiners how much ethanol to blend into gasoline.
\
In November 2013, the EPA did make an attempt to announce the proposed 2014 blend levels -- which by then were already months past the legally mandated deadline. The EPA set the proposed 2014 standard to a level lower than 2013's, even though the law requires increasing amounts. Ethanol producers, who were expecting the usual uptick, loudly opposed the reduction. They made so much noise, the EPA agreed to reconsider. To date, the 2014 standards have not yet been announced.
\
Then, in November 2014, the EPA announced it would make a decision next year (2015) on how much ethanol refiners had to add to gasoline this year (2014).
\
Congress enacted the RFS in 2005 and revised it in 2007 -- which also provided incentives to America's fledgling ethanol industry. At the time, gasoline demand was rising to an all-time high and oil imports comprised more than 58 percent of U.S. oil consumption.
\
Then the world changed. The U.S. economy plunged into its worst recession ever, unemployment soared, and gasoline demand fell sharply. Meanwhile, advanced drilling technologies began producing oil and natural gas from U.S. shale formations.
\
With crude oil supplies flooding the market, prices have been cut in half. Although fears over foreign-oil dependence have abated, the U.S. remains stuck with an ethanol mandate that is outdated, unworkable, and even harmful to vehicles, engines, and the environment.
\
Additionally, studies indicate ethanol usage increases greenhouse gas emissions. Politico reports: ""Some green groups have vocally abandoned their support for corn ethanol, blaming the crop for polluting water supplies, wiping out conservation land and even increasing carbon emissions."" According to Craig Cox, director of the Ames, Iowa, office of the Environmental Working Group, an environmental group that opposes the mandate as it is now structured: ""Corn ethanol's brand has been seriously dented in the last 18 months. ... it certainly doesn't occupy the same pedestal that it occupied two years ago.""
\
But then, politics entered the scene. Rumors flew that the announcement of the 2014 blend levels was delayed to help Rep. Bruce Braley (IA-D) in his Senate bid. Braley was pushing for an increase in the proposed levels and was hoping that he would be able to influence the White House to raise the targets. Politico quotes Braley saying: ""Voters in Iowa look at where I stand on this issue and where my opponent stands, who's supporting me in this campaign and who's supporting (Ernst)."" The Politico story states: ""Iowans say wavering on corn ethanol once would have been certain political suicide in a state where 90 percent of the land is farm acreage. So Braley sought to capitalize on Ernst's expressed qualms about big government, portraying her as someone Iowans can't trust to fight for them."" Yet, Ernst, a Republican, won the Senate seat formerly held by Democrat Tom Harkin by 8.5 percentage points.
\
On top of the usual problems with ethanol, the EPA's unwillingness to do its job by setting blending level volumes -- along with ethanol's loss of political heft -- should provide the impetus for ending the complex and wasteful RFS program.
\
Ethanol is a rare topic where environmentalists and energy advocates agree. Now it is time for our elected officials to join the people. As soon as Congress convenes in January, it should get to work to reform or even repeal the RPS.
