0,"The massive energy bill moving through Congress contains a controversial provision called ""cap and trade."" The measure would force some businesses to limit the carbon dioxide (CO ² ) they create; to purchase ""offsets"" that support environmental initiatives; or to buy the right to emit CO ² from companies that pollute less. The bill's supporters say it's critical to fighting global warming, but opponents say the benefit to the environment isn't worth the price.\The conservative Heritage Foundation says cap and trade would raise yearly household energy bills $1200 by 2035.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the cost at $22 billion by 2020, or about $175 per household.\Sen. Jon Kyl (R., Ariz.) says forcing companies to pay for offsets would raise the cost of energy and virtually all consumer goods: ""All Americans, regardless of income, will feel the effects of this tax hike.""\Environmentalists acknowledge that the measure would have costs but argue that failure to limit carbon emissions would be much worse. They want strong federal oversight to make sure offsets sold by forest landowners, farmers, and others result in measurable and sustainable carbon reductions. Says Bill Burtis of the environmental group Clean Air-Cool Planet: ""A market for high-quality carbon offsets is necessary to combat global warming."""
1,"Imagine yourself preparing to pay for your purchase at a local grocery store and the clerk asks you, ""Paper or plastic?"" Innocuously , and preferring the diverse functionality of plastic bags, you reply, ""Plastic."" Next thing you know your head is being smacked against the scanner and you're being cuffed by some fearsome-looking officer dressed in green and white, and he declares, ""That's the magic word. Green police. You picked the wrong day to mess with the ecosystem, plastic boy.""\On returning home you see similarly attired officers scavenging through all your neighbors ' garbage cans, obviously looking for contraband. One officer yells out ecstatically, ""Batteries!"" at which time a swarm of green and white clad police leap into action and converge on the perpetrator of the heinous crime. What? You missed the crime? He threw away batteries. You can't be much more egregious in your crimes against humanity and the Earth than that!\That evening, after indulging in one of your favorite fruits, you go to the sink to dispose of the orange peels in the garbage disposal. Before you even have a chance to place the offending rinds into the sink, a spotlight blinds you from a helicopter circling overhead, and an authoritative voice commands, ""Put the rind down."" You should have known, it should have been composted instead of chopped up in the disposal. You abruptly turn and run for your life from the omnipresent green police as you see them swarming up your driveway to arrest you.\You next observe your neighbor doing a ""perp-walk"" down his driveway, while a live television crew covers the horrific incident. The announcer declares, ""Tragedy strikes tonight for a man who has just been arrested for possession of an incandescent light bulb."" The bulb was undoubtedly a 100 watt variety, which is now banned from production and sale in the United States. He should have known better, you think to yourself, and had his incandescent bulbs replaced with those squirrelly mercurybased bulbs\that require\a HAZMAT team to clean up when they're broken.\You notice a couple of youths nearby being detained by the green police who are ostentatiously pouring the water out of their plastic water bottles , declaring, ""What do you think of your plastic water bottles now?"" The youths should have used bota bags, as long as they weren't made of leather because that would have made them subject to harassment from the PETA police.\The green police have swarmed into another neighbor's yard where a young couple is relaxing in a hot tub. You notice one officer attempting to place handcuffs on the young man, while another is proclaiming their crime, ""The water setting is at 105."" The young man flees for his life.\These scenarios were played out during the Super Bowl a few weeks ago in an Audi ""clean diesel"" car commercial. All good humor (if we accept the premise that the ad was designed to be humorous) has an element of truth which provides the foundation for jocularity. The element of truth here is that there are no doubt many who would support such fascistic efforts to protect the environment and ""save the planet.""\Those who would dogmatically adhere to such a creed would no doubt like to see legislation and enforcement by ""green police"" supporting their pantheistic pet peeves. It seems those who either worship the Earth on a par with God, or in lieu of God, believe all the Earth's inhabitants should be forced to abide by their personal pantheistic or environmentally conscious standards. But would not such legislation and enforcement be on a par with their accusations against protectors of the unborn, of ""legislating morality ?"" Would that not also be on a par with refusing ""the right to choose,"" which ostensibly is the sacrosanct precept upon which abortion rights are argued ? The dichotomy makes for a delicious debate. Based on that value system, it's OK to choose to kill the unborn, but it's not acceptable to choose plastic over paper. Now that's a warped value system!\There are parts of the country well on their way to such ""green police"" enforcement. San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom twittered, ""Ok. That 'green police' Audi commercial hits home."" And no wonder it hits home for him. His city currently requires citizens to compost their food waste, or face a $500 fine for violation. Nationally, President Obama and the majority leadership in Washington want to enact an energy policy (Cap and Trade) that will impose punitive fines for what they deem excessive carbon emissions, and impose drastically higher electricity costs and lower standards of living. New York has its own trans-fat police forcing restaurants into municipal ordinance compliance. That's just a tip of the iceberg.\Freedom has a price, and part of it is vigilance by the citizens to prevent fascistic and tyrannical coercions of do-gooders who seek to impose their extremist environmental morality on the rest of us. While intended as humor, the Audi Super Bowl ad can serve as an awakening to the intentions of such extremists. Heaven forbid that the ad should serve as a portent of things to come.\There are parTs of The counTry well on Their way To such 'green police' enforcemenT."
2,"This past week California Gov. Jerry Brown announced that his state is facing a ""ballooning"" budget deficit of more than $16 billion. In an interview on CBS News, Brown said ""We're not some tired country of Europe. We're a buoyant, dynamic society that will both discipline itself on a daily basis but it will on the longterm plant the seeds of future growth.""\What is inscrutably lost on the governor is that the policies that have brought California to the edge of a fiscal cliff are mostly the same ones of those ""tired"" countries of Europe, which have manifest the same degree of financial discipline that California has practiced.\Many trends, fads and even governmental policies have originated in the Golden State that have even given rise to a widely accepted aphorism , ""As California goes, so goes the nation."" It's the verity of that truism that makes the state's financial problems a portent of things to come for the rest of the nation if we fail to learn from California's experience.\Joel Kotkin, one of the nation's premier demographers , has identified the most significant contributing factors to California's problems. He points out in a recent Wall Street Journal article that 4 million more people have left California in the last two decades than have moved there from other states. This is in sharp contrast with the 1980s when 100,000 more Americans were settling in California each year than were leaving. Most of those leaving nowadays are young families.\They're leaving because they can't afford to live there. Everything from food, energy and taxes to real estate and housing are beyond the financial reach of young families. Kotkin points to restrictions and massive regulations on development and housing that have artificially limited housing supply. As he explains, California's socalled ""smart growth"" plans literally force middle-class families into less expensive, high-density housing, or out of state.\From his analysis, housing is merely one front of what he refers to as the ""progressive war on the middle class."" The high cost of energy has had a dramatic impact on everyone, but especially on the middle class. Policies restricting traditional sources of energy, and state financed advantages granted to green energy producers have resulted in skyrocketing energy costs. The price per kilowatt hour of electricity is nearly twice what it is in Idaho, and more than 50 percent above the national average, according to Electricchoice.com.\Yet state policy makers are doubling down on green energy and on the restriction to traditional producers , which are expected to make the rates rise even more. For California has enthusiastically embraced cap-and-trade with the legislation AB32 ""... which will raise the cost of energy and drive out manufacturing jobs without making even a dent in global carbon emissions. Then there are the renewable portfolio standards, which mandate that a third of the state's energy come from renewable sources like wind and the sun by 2020,"" according to the Wall Street Journal.\Most of these costs are borne by the middle class since those below the poverty level get state assistance and the wealthy can afford it. But the high energy costs drive manufacturing and other blue-collar energy users either out of business or out of the state.\And not only are energy costs much higher, but with two decades worth of policy and tax-advantaged investment in green energy, the promised windfall of jobs has not occurred. Only 2 percent of the job force in California is in green energy , roughly the same as Texas, which maintains a vastly different green energy policy. Rather, in part due to the higher operating costs in California created by onerous regulation, companies and their jobs have been exiting the state. California currently has the third highest unemployment rate in the nation at 10.9 percent.\The Golden State has significant gas and oil resources, yet policy and regulation preclude utilizing them. An estimated 25 billion barrels of oil are sitting untapped in the vast Monterey and Bakersfield shale deposits. Over the past decade, Texas has created 200,000 oil and gas jobs, while California has hardly added any. The Wall Street Journal pointed out recently that California's ""remaining energy producers have been slowing down as the regulatory environment becomes ever more hostile even as producers elsewhere, including in Rustbelt states like Ohio and Pennsylvania , ramp up. The oil and gas jobs the Golden State political class shuns pay around $100,000 a year on average.""\""You see the great tragedy of California is that we have all this oil and gas, we won't use it,"" Kotkin told the Wall Street Journal. ""We have the richest farmland in the world, and we're trying to strangle it."" The latter point references how water restrictions aimed at protecting the delta smelt fish are endangering Central Valley farmers. Kotkin asserts that is the kind of ""anti-human"" public policy that is driving agriculture out and is impacting so many of the state's economic sectors.\Kotkin explains the demographic changes are occurring because of state policy. ""Californians are now voting much more based on social issues and less on fiscal ones...,"" he told the Wall Street Journal. Consequently, it's a much less favorable climate for employers than ever before. ""As progressive policies drive out moderate and conservative members of the middle class, California's politics become even more leftwing. It's a classic case of natural selection, and increasingly the only ones fit to survive in California are the very rich and those who rely on government spending. In a nutshell, 'the state is run for the very rich, the very poor, and the public employees,'"" Kotkin explained to the Wall Street Journal.\Middle-class families are fleeing California in droves. As a result, California is turning into a two-and-a-half-class society. On top are the ""entrenched incumbents"" who inherited their wealth or came to California early and made their money, and the self-made technology millionaires. Then there's a shrunken middle class of public employees and, miles below, a permanent welfare class. As it stands today, about 40 percent of Californians don't pay any income tax and a quarter are on Medicaid. It's ""a very scary political dynamic,"" Kotkin told the Wall Street Journal.\Meanwhile, taxes are decimating the private sector economy. According to the Tax Foundation, California has the 48th-worst business tax climate. ""The wealthy pay a top rate of 10.3 percent, the thirdhighest in the country, while middle-class workers--those who earn more than $48,000--pay a top rate of 9.3 percent, which is higher than what millionaires pay in 47 states. And state leaders want to raise tax rates even more,"" according to the Wall Street Journal.\The reason taxes have been increasing to now unsustainable levels is that Sacramento has been unable to curtail spending. State spending has more than doubled in the past 10 years. Costs for state pensions have increased by over 150 percent in the same time period, as demands from state employee unions have required a greater percentage of the budget. Unable to muster the discipline to reduce spending to match economic realities, the only tool the state seems to know how to use is tax increases.\The lessons from California are many, and this analysis only scratches the surface. The question is, will we as a nation learn them before or after we're in the same malaise?\Award-winning columnist Richard Larsen, of Pocatello, is president of the brokerage firm Larsen Financial. He graduated from Idaho State University with degrees in history and political science."
3,"When I think of Gov. C.L. ""Butch"" Otter, what comes to mind is this principled Republican congressman who had the courage to oppose the Patriot Act -- at a time when it was not popular to do so.\His defiance on that issue put him at odds with President Bush and many of his Republican colleagues, wanting to take drastic security measures in the wake of 9/11. But Otter's interests went beyond reactionary politics. He talked about constitutional rights and the dangers of big government invading the privacy of Americans.\Recently, Congress came around to Otter's thinking by not renewing the Patriot Act.\So, for me, it's difficult to imagine this modern-day ""Profile in Courage"" -- who is serving his third term as Idaho's governor -- essentially spitting on the state Constitution he took an oath to uphold and trying to change the rules for his political convenience.\The governor has five days to veto a bill, otherwise it becomes law. He knows that, and so does practically everyone else in state government. The governor was two days late in his veto aimed at shutting down instant horse racing terminals, which in the eyes of the Senate had the look and smell of slot machines.\I don't believe his intentions were evil. Perhaps he was reluctant to pull the plug on an enterprise operating at Post Falls, Garden City and Idaho Falls. Maybe he was feeling compassion to those who had jobs running those operations -- jobs that were lost after the court voided Otter's veto.\But the rules are clear. Otter did not exercise his veto power in time, and that should have been the end of story.\Others then carried on with the trail of irresponsibility. The Senate leadership allowed for a veto override vote, knowing full well that Otter missed the veto deadline. Secretary of State Lawerence Denney and Attorney General Lawrence Wasden, as independent constitutional officers, could have taken steps to stop the insanity, but didn't.\These were not actions of evil people. What they did, or failed to do, is reflective of the Statehouse culture. Rule No. 1 in this environment is to avoid upsetting the governor. One of the few people who got away with violating that unwritten rule was Congressman Raul Labrador, but only because he built his own power base.\Russ Fulcher, a former Senate Republican caucus chair who challenged for Otter's seat in last year's primary, was not as lucky. Fulcher opposed the governor on two big issues -- the proposed 2-cent gas tax in 2009, and more recently on the insurance exchange issue -- and paid the price.\""When I said no to the gas tax, it never was the same after that,"" Fulcher said. ""I had crossed the line and was no longer the team player. The leadership meetings were a little less open when I was there. There's pressure not to mess with the system or the status quo.""\In 2009, Labrador and other House members were doing more than messing with the status quo. They were turning the place upside down in opposing the gas tax. As the communication adviser for House Republicans at the time, I was sending out my share of press releases and op-eds defending the House view.\It all changed in 2010, a re-election year for the governor. I was directed to work with the governor's office on developing a unified message for Republicans. That has been the culture ever since. The debacle of the horse racing machines was just the most recent reflection of that culture. Other examples include the failed attempt to privatize the prisons and the botched Idaho Education Network.\""There's a human nature that transcends politics,"" Fulcher said. ""If you have attention and resources, you are idolized in many ways. The lobby role is to build you up and be on your good side, and it becomes an unhealthy situation.""\As one who has seen these cultural changes, Fulcher has become an advocate for term limits. ""The system is geared toward the incumbent.""\There has been no shortage of negative media coverage of the horse racing machines or scandals that have popped up. But in this environment, those in power don't need the media, and accountability is not a priority.\Otter, especially, wins by convincing margins regardless. Unless the culture changes, that entitles those in power to make up the rules as they go.\Chuck Malloy is a native Idahoan and long-time political reporter and editorial writer.

4,"POCATELLO -- The Idaho State Journal asked all seven candidates vying for the three Pocatello City Council seats up for election this year to answer three specific questions:\1. What is the single biggest issue facing Pocatello today?\2. How would you address that issue?\3. What are the two or three issues facing the city over the next four years?\Below are their answers and a brief introduction to each candidate.\All seven are expected to participate in tonight's Candidates Forum, hosted by the League of Women Voters of Pocatello from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the Pocatello City Council Chambers, located at 711 N. Seventh Ave.\The only exception could be Steve Brown, who currently holds Seat No. 2. Brown has been caring for an ill child who is being treated at a Salt Lake City hospital.\Seat No. 2 - Mark Balzer\Mark Balzer first became politically active in the 1990s after deciding he didn't like the direction the U.S. seemed to be headed in.\Although he has run for several offices within his party, and has been a longtime precinct chair, it's the first time Balzer's running for elected office.\""I have had people encouraging me to run for about the last four years,"" he said. ""I decided the time was right.""\Among the concerns he has that prompted his decision to run are matters dealing with city spending and property rights.\Balzer, 50, first came to Idaho as a member of the U.S. Navy, spending two years in the Gem State. He also met his wife, who pulled him back to Idaho in 1991. He's been in Pocatello since 2005.\Balzer's answers:\1. Pocatello, like all municipalities faces the question of how to\handle financial obligations with reduced revenue. In most of these cases, and Pocatello is no exception, the issue is not a revenue problem but a spending problem. With fewer businesses in town, property values dropping , and long term unemployment ; the revenue from taxes has dropped across the board. The recent reduction in the property tax exemption allowed by the state has resulted in a net increase in property tax for most property owners in Pocatello. This increase will affect everyone with an assessed property value between $84,000 and $184,000 in spite of the reduction in the cities mill levy. Our city budget is still almost 7.5 percent over budget and, as any home or business owner knows this is unsustainable.\2. We must re-think our budget process. If necessary , we need to reduce the spending. First, department heads must identify all revenue streams. Current salaries and benefits must be covered, and then we can begin to consider other expenditures. When expenditures equal revenue the spending must stop. If there are things that must be purchased or services that must be provided, department managers must prioritize. This may require budget planners to follow a twostep process. First go back through the budget and look for budgeted items that can be cut or reduced. Second managers may need to formulate a plan of action that stretches over more than one budget year. In these cases it is the responsibility of the City Council to assist the department managers is formulating these plans and then following through in subsequent budget years.\3. Our budget problems will be ongoing. There will be a constant issue between the amount of money available and the services people desire. This can be a delicate concern that requires continuous balance by elected officials.\The need to encourage business growth in the area is paramount. We must provide an atmosphere friendly to business both large and small. In speaking with small business owners and those who have tried to start a small business, the concern everyone shared with me is that of over regulation.\We face the need for a new animal shelter. I would like to see an effort similar to the one which resulted in the building of Brooklyn's playground. Our community saw a need and came together. This will give the community true ownership in the shelter and a better understanding for the challenges faced by pets and their owners in the community.\Seat 2 - Scott Odekirk\Originally from Utah, Scott Odekirk came to Pocatello seven years ago, unsure of just how long he and his wife would be here.\They currently have no plans to leave.\""The more we got to know people and the more we settled in, the more we decided this was where we wanted to be,"" he said.\He came to Pocatello to coach the Debate Team at Idaho State University and is now working on finishing his master's degree in public administration.\Odekirk's decision to run came when his wife got involved with rally for Medicaid funding.\""It seemed more and more that my future wasn't just to be a civil servant somewhere, but to be in office , being a voice for those who might not otherwise get heard,"" he said.\Odekirk, 29, said he was approached about running and immediately took to the idea.\Odekirk's answers:\1. The main issue I have confronted on the campaign trail is the long-term economic growth of Pocatello. This is not a single-issue e l e c t i o n. People want better jobs, good professional and educational o p p o r t u -nities for their children , more vibrant and beautiful neighborhoods, and less property taxes, along with many other issues. But all of these issues come back to Pocatello's strategy for long-term growth. Smart economic growth will require the City of Pocatello to act and think in more innovative ways. Smart growth involves protecting and harnessing our environmental resources, promoting ourselves as a high-tech future-oriented community, fostering a more proactive relationship between Pocatello and ISU, ensuring basic services like Fire, EMT, Public Safety protections, and more. These things all play into the perception of Pocatello as a place to live, visit, and invest in.\2. To make Pocatello a more prosperous community the city government, and particularly our City Council, must be more proactive, rather than being reactive in an attempt to preserve the status quo. We need a new attitude in city government. Elected officials must be willing to regularly meet with citizens , take input, and gather good ideas. Too often our council seems to think in an outdated and narrow frame about problems and solutions. When you're holding a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. When this Council observes this economic crisis, all they are holding is a tax break. Everyone is for tax breaks for businesses willing to invest here, including me. But we also have to make city policy that protects and harness our environmental assets, celebrates our differences, ensures dignity and respect for all, and emphasizes our University, to promote ourselves as a place for smart growth.\3. I have outlined many issues that Pocatello will face. There are three problems that keep me up at night that are also a major part of my motivation to run. First, people in my generation need to step up and participate in this community in the way that our predecessors have done before us. Second, we need to become a college town, not just a town with a college in it. And third, we need to find a way keep so many of our most talented people from moving away. I have seen first-hand the awe-inspiring capacities of the people here on my debate team and in the community. Imagine if more of these people stayed here and became invested in the city. My dream for Pocatello is that more of our most talented people decide, as many of us have, that Pocatello is the place to be.\Seat 2 - Steve Brown\After serving on the board of the Pocatello Development Authority for 11 years -- nearly half of that as its chair -- Steve Brown decided he wanted to do more.\To scratch that itch, he applied for the Pocatello City Council Seat No. 2 last summer after it was vacated by then Councilman Brian Und e r w o o d , who left for a position in Boise.\He was appointed by Pocatello Mayor Brian Blad and unanimously confirmed by the City Council in the July of 2010.\Brown, 43, was born in Logan, Utah, as his parents were in the process of moving to Pocatello. They had stopped to visit family in the Northern Utah town when he was born.\Among the accomplishment's he is most proud of is his part in moving the Pocatello Development Authority toward becoming an example agency throughout the Gem State for handling tax increment finance districts.\""We have done a good job here in making sure our TIF districts are job specific and completed in the shortest time possible so those funds can go back on the tax rolls,"" Brown said. ""And we lead the state when it comes to closing TIFs.""\Brown currently serves as regional director for U.S. Congressman Mike Simpson.\Brown's answers:\1. The stability of future funding is one of our biggest concerns. How do we pay for city services when revenue from the state and federal government is shrinking? One example would be taxes on gasoline which are collected by the state of Idaho and then redistributed to the cities. As people drive less due to the higher price of gas and new cars become more fuel efficient, less gas tax is collected. The city of Pocatello has well over 250 miles of roads and the challenge of maintaining our streets in the midst of dwindling funds is a prime example of the struggle city government has in meeting the needs of our citizens. How do we continue adequately fund departments and services without adding to the financial burdens of the tax payer is the question to ask when evaluating our budget funding.\2. Building on my experience of 11 years on the Pocatello Development Authority and having served on the City Council this past year, I believe we have made great strides in financially preparing for the future through a strong economic development effort and responsible budget. Carefully using urban renewal programs, tax increment financing plans, creating first-ever capital savings accounts and delivering the biggest cut in the property tax levy in 15 years, we are laying a foundation for a strong financial tomorrow in this dreary economic time. I also believe the time has come to introduce the use of an independent government efficiency committee to review the operations and services of our city government. Such an effort would highlight items needing attention as well as validate those things we are doing right.\3. Basic civility. Current members of the city council are not politically or ideologically aligned, but we are able to debate and work toward solutions with the common cause of a better city. In a day when frustrations with all things government run high, it is important to be able to truly communicate. Good people can disagree and still be good people.\2. For the sake of our entire community the Portneuf Greenway is an issue that needs to be seriously addressed. It requires all parties involved to be willing to have a realistic discussion regarding alternative routes and funding priorities. Eminent domain is not the answer but neither is inaction. Compromise is necessary as this is a quality of life issue which prospective companies look to as part of a larger list of criteria in decisions to expand into our area.\Seat 1 - Brad Huerta\While he may seem like the new face in Pocatello politics, Brad Huerta is actually making his second run at the Pocatello City Council.\Of course, the first came back in mid-1990 s while he was still working on his\b a c h e l o r ' s degree at Idaho State University. He dodged early fame, but the Persian Gulf War veteran , who served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1989 to 1993, went on to earn his masters degree in public administration in Denver, even working for a U.S. Congressman at office in Colorado's capitol.\Some 17 years after his first attempt, Huerta, 41, has decided the time felt right.\""What I like is that the City Council is one of the last seats you can hold that is truly nonpartisan,"" he said. ""I am in a position in my life and career where I can devote the time and energy and want to give back to the city that has given so much to me.""\Huerta is owner and operator of Insight Communication Strategies in Pocatello.\Huerta's Answers:\1. Without a doubt, I believe the major issue facing the city right now is economic development. As a city, we continue to grow at only 1.3 percent a year. We need to continue to pursue investments from companies that can provide real and meaningful employment for our residents. Jobs that can provide real benefits, living wages, and long-term security for working families are the machines that will drive Pocatello's future prosperity. Without this, our area families will continue to struggle with unemployment, which affects our tax base, our city services, and overall growth.\2. By continuing to advocate for strong probusiness policies like resisting continued state attempts to repeal or roll back urban renewal laws, continue to fight for the repeal of personal property taxes on businesses that operate in the Pocatello area and continue to fund and support the efforts of the Pocatello Development Authority and the Bannock Development Corporation. By building a stronger business environment for responsible corporate citizens that supply good paying jobs and benefits for our hard working labor force, we can continue to move forward as a community.\3. Aside from economic growth and job creation we will need to finally address completing the Portneuf Greenway, fixing the severe\shortages in vital city services like the ambulance district and police officer training and recruitment, and building our animal shelter. Lastly, I believe we need a council that is reflective of all of us... veterans, workers, young people, labor, students, business, the elderly and all of the rich diversity that makes up our city. I want to ensure that we all have a voice, and a chance to be heard so we can keep this city a wonderful and safe place to raise our families, have meaningful employment, and grow our city economy.\Seat 1 - Jim Johnston\Jim Johnston has been a fixture in the Pocatello business community for much of the 38 years he's lived here.\He came to the Gate City with a master's degree in religion to teach at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints' Institute of Religion at Idaho State University. His proximity to ISU led him to start work on a doctorate in local government.\""I did all the course work, but never did complete the degree,"" he said.\Johnston, 69, went into real estate and didn't believe he would need the additional degree. He and his son Greg Johnston form the Johnston Team at The Home Specialists Real Estate Company.\Johnston is the incumbent for Pocatello City Council Seat No. 1. He was appointed to the seat this past summer when then City Council Ron Frasure resigned the position. It was his intention to seek election to the seat when he applied for the vacancy.\""I wouldn't have taken it otherwise,"" he said. ""I want this to be a long-term situation , not a short one.""\Johnston's answers:\1. In my opinion, the single biggest issue facing Pocatello is almost out of our control, and that's the national economy. I see Pocatello and its leadership making great strides to improve the local economy by attracting new business and helping to boost our economy. I also see various levels of government working hard to cut expenses and to preserve for consumers the dollars they have.\2. My greatest concern is that we not discourage creativity in our community. Gynii Gilliam, and Bannock Development Corp., are the greatest assets next to the wonderful workforce that we already have in Pocatello. I lend my support to continued economic growth through new jobs and additional business opportunities. I never want to see existing, viable, good businesses go under so we have to keep taxes low and encourage additional growth.\3. During the next four years, I anticipate that Pocatello is going to need to get a new animal shelter. We have 12,000 cats and 11,000 dogs inside the city limits of Pocatello. This is a community that loves animals and we need to take better care of the pets that come into out animal shelter.\The Portneuf Greenway also needs to be completed as an additional benefit of Pocatello. The best ideas for completing the greenway may not have yet come to the table.\We also need greater involvement in local government by the people. More people need to buy into the fact that the best government is local government and the best government we get is when we are involved.\Seat 3 - Paul Gagliardi\Paul Gagliardi moved to Pocatello eight years ago after his only child decided he would not be returning to Massachusetts after finishing his degree at Idaho State University.\""I came out to see what it was that was keeping my son from coming home,"" Gagliardi said. ""I fell in love with the place and my wife and I moved out here.""\He spent several years working as a real estate appraiser before retiring in 2010. He opened a clothing store, White Pepper Gallery, in Old Town Pocatello this past summer.\Gagliardi, 60, said he decided to run after attending City Council meetings and making one distinct observation.\""They talked the talk but didn't walk the walk,"" he said. ""It just never seems to gel. I got to to city council meetings and things get discussed and get rediscussed and discussed again and they never get resolved.""\Gagliardi's answers:\1. The biggest issue facing Pocatello seems to be a lack of confidence in leadership due to inactivity. When I started campaigning for city council, I talked to our local citizens about their concerns. The voters seem less and less confident in the ability of our current leadership to gain the necessary ground to accomplish any one of these issues in a substantive way. The voters say they have been listening to promises for a long time. What they really want is for someone to provide them with results.\2. I would approach our present government model as a business plan. The mayor is a CEO. The city council is a board of directors. The investors in this case would be our taxpayers. When the job of effective business management is correctly applied, and the business model is well executed, your investors should realize a decent rate of return for their dollars invested. When the investors happen to be our taxpayers, they should be happy to see their tax dollars being efficiently and effectively well spent.\3. There is really only one all-important issue. The issue is ""action."" It doesn't matter what issues may be facing us, if we don't don't seem to be doing anything to effect some solutions. If we don't get on with the business of growing this city, following through with ideas, providing some visible and effective leadership -- if we don't start providing results -- then we will be in the same situation four more years from now.\Seat 3 - Eva Nye\Eva Nye is the Pocatello City Council Seat No. 3 incumbent , seeking her third election to the seat she was appointed to in 2002.\Active in the community for much of her 35 years here, Nye said she longed to do something more concrete when the vacancy came up with the resignation of Penny Pink.\""I just wanted to give back to the community,"" she said. ""I just felt it was a great opportunity to give back and serve the community.""\She's most excited about the businesses brought into Pocatello during her time in City Council through the combined efforts of the city, Bannock Development Corp., -- which she has been on the board of the past two years -- and the Pocatello Development Authority.\With what she feels is a great climate for business, and a tax levy now the lowest it's been in 15 years, Nye says she is ready to see ""all this hard work come to fruition."" She believes Pocatello is about to reap the rewards of years of hard work on the part of local government.\Nye's answers:\1. The major issue facing Pocatello and many other cities across the country is providing jobs that offer good pay and benefits for our citizens. Cost of living must be affordable, neighborhoods must be safe. Clean air and water, a sensitivity to our environment and smart community development and growth are important. These things combined with the easy access we have to outdoor recreation continue to bring people to Southeast Idaho.\2. During my service on the city council I have fought to recruit jobs to Pocatello and to retain those businesses we have. In just the last couple of years we have brought Hoku, Petersen, Allstate, Costco, and many others. ON Semiconductor continues to expand in Pocatello. We have the newest and best hospital that is truly a gem for our community. Economic development, maintaining quality infrastructure , and protecting the pocketbooks of our citizens and seniors will always be my priority.\3. I hope to continue working for the citizens of Pocatello. I am very proud of the fact that we have the lowest property tax levy in 15 years. Projects I would like to see completed in the next four years are; the Cheyenne South Valley connector, the Portneuf Greenway, and the ground breaking and completion of an animal shelter that the city and its residents can be proud of. I hope that an overwhelming number of citizens will support the Ambulance Bond. The good work of our Police and Fire departments should be recognized."
5,"POCATELLO -- There have been major disruptions in the traditional academic world, according to Idaho State University Vice President for Research and Economic Development Dr. Howard Grimes.\Grimes walked through these disruptions at the Bannock Development Corp 23rd Economic Symposium Thursday at the Stephens Performing Arts Center. He said institutions of higher education have had to adjust to some new realities.\""It's forced a lot of change in higher education ,"" Grimes said.\The first major disruption has been the erosion of state budgeted revenue for colleges and universities. Grimes said this has forced universities to secure other revenue sources and become more nimble.\Another big disruption has been the fact that 48 percent of the jobs that college students are preparing for will not exist in the future. Grimes credited ISU President Arthur Vailas for understanding that the wave of the future is for students to have multiple areas of expertise and accreditation to make them more valuable in the workplace.\The third disruption has been the advent of technology and online instruction.\""We have the ability to reach a lot more students in a more economical way,"" Grimes said.\Grimes anticipates online instruction will continue to see growth and the idea of one instructor providing lessons to thousands of students at the same time will lead to ""superstar teachers.""\Grimes said the last disruption to higher education has been major changes in the types of research and its funding. He said the era of pure fundamental research with no link to the real world is likely over or extremely limited.\""Universities are expected to form interdisciplinary teams to find solutions to real life problems ,"" Grimes said.\He said this will force the need for innovation and partnerships between the business community and academia.\""Idaho State is absolutely committed to the commercialization of research,"" Grimes said. He called it a ""bench to market"" approach.\The vice president said the recent approval by the State Board of Education of a new Intellectual Property Foundation 501-C 3 non-profit will make compacts between university resources and the private sector a lot easier. ISU recently created a agreement between International Isotopes, Inc. of Idaho Falls and the nuclear program at ISU for the production of novel isotopes for medical purposes.\Grimes said other large opportunities for these types of partnerships exist in areas like ecosystem services.\""We need to be able to protect our natural resources ,"" Grimes said.\U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo also addressed the economic summit and talked about the fiscal challenges facing this nation. But he pointed out that Bannock County and Pocatello were ranked high as good locations for small businesses because of the low cost of doing business.\However he said the ""toxic environment"" in Washington has left many important issues unresolved that would ultimately help this nation's economy.\""We need common sense,"" Crapo said about the national budget and debt. ""The fact is we spend too much.""\The senator said he would like to see a major reform of the U.S. tax code take place that would simplify taxes and enable the nation to lower them and still increase revenue.\Crapo said it is also critical that Congress find a longterm solution to the Highway Bill and the need for more funding in the Highway Trust Fund. He said it is critical to the nation's infrastructure to maintain roads and bridges, but there is no chance a majority in Congress would approve a hike in the federal gas tax.\""It's the same gridlock,"" Crapo said. ""One way or the other we've got to get past that."""
