0,"YELLOW SPRINGS -- This village could become home to the largest solar power array in Southwest Ohio in 2012 as part of a $65 million project to put new solar power in smaller Ohio villages and cities. \Mike Dickman, vice president of SolarVision of Westerville near Columbus, said he's close to a financing deal for the ambitious project. He'd like to break ground later this year, he said. \Aside from federal tax credits that will be part of the project, the financing now in its last phases is from private sources, Dickman said. \In Yellow Springs, a 2.5 megawatt array is planned for part of 44 acres of farmland owned by the village that's northwest of town off King Street, said Mark Cundiff, village manager. \Yellow Springs signed a purchase agreement for all the electricity and plans to use it during periods of high demand to lower costs during ""peak"" periods, Cundiff said. \A megawatt (MW) of power is equivalent to one million watts. Renewable energy, because it relies on natural factors, does not produce a consistent power stream. For example, the 1.1 MW Dayton Power & Light solar array in Washington Twp. produces enough electricity to power 150 average homes in a year, but up to 750 on bright days. \Between the solar array and new Ohio River hydroelectric projects being built now, Yellow Springs intends to draw more than 50 percent of its power needs from renewable sources in 2013, Cundiff said. \Yellow Springs owns its electric power distribution system. \The village's aggressive renewable goal is being helped by American Municipal Power Inc. or AMP, which is building new hydro projects on the Ohio River at existing dams. \AMP said that the projects will add 300 megawatts of capacity. AMP has called the projects ""the largest development of new run-of-the-river hydroelectric generation in the country."" \Dickman said other sites planned for solar arrays include Celina, Wapakoneta, Greenfield, Carey, Wellington, Clyde and Newark. The projects should generate 20 megawatts of electricity, more than any single solar installation operating in Ohio. \Dayton Power & Light's 1.1 megawatt facility at 9975 Yankee St. in Washington Twp. began operating in 2010. \Ohio law has an alternative energy standard requiring that 25 percent of electricity sold by Ohio's electric distribution utilities or electric services companies be generated from alternative energy sources by 2025. At least half must be from renewables, such as solar, wind, biomass and hydro with a minimum of one-half percent from solar. One half of the renewable energy must be from Ohio installations. \Coal powers 86 percent of Ohio's electric generation, natural gas and other gases account for 2 percent, Nuclear power is 10 percent and wind, solar and hydro make up about 1 percent.\Credit: By Steve Bennish, Staff Writer"

GOV. John Kasich interrupted his presidential campaign last week to return to Ohio. While he was in Columbus, he asserted that he sees no need even to ask voters in 2016 whether they want the state to borrow as much as $1 billion to help pay to clean up Lake Erie and other key waterways. ""I don't see any reason to really do any more at this point,"" he said.
\
The governor added that he has no interest in reversing one of the worst failures of his administration: his acquiescence in the terrible decision last year by the Republican-controlled General Assembly to repudiate Ohio's standards to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. That measure was a transparent sop to Columbus' imposing fossil-fuel lobbies.
\
Mr. Kasich evidently believes that such positions burnish his credentials for national political leadership - or at least the GOP presidential nomination. Maybe the latter, but certainly not the former.
\
Northwest Ohioans do not need to be reminded that a harmful algae bloom in western Lake Erie generated a toxin that poisoned Toledo's water supply for three days in the summer of 2014, depriving nearly 500,000 consumers of their usual source of drinking water. A new study by scientists at Ohio State University and elsewhere warns that the number of major blooms in the lake, already chronically high, could double in the next 100 years.
\
Yet Mr. Kasich seems content with modest measures to limit agricultural pollution of Lake Erie's tributaries, such as a new law that restricts farmers' application of manure and chemical fertilizer on frozen or saturated ground. The governor has joined calls for a 40 percent reduction over the next decade in the amount of phosphorus, which feeds toxic algae, flowing into western Lake Erie. Some environmental scientists suggest that goal is already inadequate.
\
The proposal to place a clean-water bond issue on next year's statewide ballot is bipartisan; Republican state Sen. Randy Gardner of Bowling Green is one of its strongest advocates. It has support, at least in principle, from a range of environmental, farm, and business interests.
\
The plan would usefully address a variety of environmental risks - including toxic algae -to Lake Erie, the Ohio River, and other major bodies of water across the state. It seeks to reduce water pollution by a broad range of sources. A competing proposal would focus on sewer overflows.
\
Either way, Mr. Kasich's conspicuous disinterest in the ballot measure won't help. Last week, he instead blamed outsiders - other states, Detroit, Canada- for polluting Lake Erie.
\
The new Lake Erie study concludes that human-made climate change could""supercharge"" the growth of harmful algae. The two-year pause in Ohio's alternative-energy standard that the governor and legislature enacted last year is contributing to climate change by encouraging the state's over-reliance on fossil fuels, notably coal, to generate electric power. That outcome is at odds with, among other things, the new global agreement on climate change reached this month in Paris.
\
To his credit, Governor Kasich has rejected a legislative proposal to extend the freeze on energy standards indefinitely. But he also said last week that he doesn't want Ohio to revert fully to the former clean-energy mandates. That seems a distinction without much of a difference.
\
Mr. Kasich also has refused to petition the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to declare the western Lake Erie basin a""distressed"" watershed. That action would allow closer scrutiny and regulation of pollution sources such as the heavily subsidized factory farms known as concentrated animal feeding operations.
\
The Kasich administration claims that such a designation would impair the public image of the western Lake Erie region. Not as much as a reprise of Toledo's water crisis would.
\
During the Republican debate this month, Mr. Kasich outlined the elements of political victory next year in Ohio, a key swing state in presidential elections. A candidate's message, he insisted, ""has to be big and bold and positive.""
\
A comprehensive, meaningful plan to repair Lake Erie, the state's most vital natural asset, would fit that description admirably. But such an economic and environmental boon doesn't appear to be on the governor's agenda.
\
Voters are told repeatedly that Governor Kasich is the thoughtful, responsible, moderate candidate in the GOP presidential field. And compared to his rivals, he is. It's all relative, but that observation isn't particularly comforting.

COLUMBUS -- An environmental group on Wednesday launched a campaign urging Ohioans to boycott FirstEnergy Corp.'s marketing arm to protest what it says are efforts by Toledo Edison to undercut Ohio's renewable energy and efficiency standards.
\
""It is time for us to stop FirstEnergy,"" said Dan Sawmiller, senior representative of Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign in Ohio. ""We will not stand by any longer without taking direct action.""
\
The first electronic billboard has gone up across from the Statehouse in Columbus where lawmakers may soon revisit Ohio's 2008 law requiring utilities to find at least 25 percent of their power from renewable or advanced technology sources by 2025.
\
FirstEnergy Solutions, the retail electricity supplier affiliate of the Akron-based utility, markets itself as an alternative to traditional utilities -- including FirstEnergy itself -- in multiple states in the Midwest and the East. Central Ohio is a major marketing target because FirstEnergy Solutions has been going after customers of American Electric Power there.
\
The boycott campaign plans paid advertising, online ads, mailers, and direct contact to urge consumers to sign a pledge that they will not sign a contract to buy their power from FirstEnergy Solutions.
\
Under state law, half of the 25 percent alternative energy standard, or 12.5 percent, must come from renewable sources such as wind, solar, and landfill gases. Half a percentage point must come from solar.
\
The advanced sources can also include such things as nuclear, fuel cells, and cleaner coal technology. Most of Ohio's electricity comes from coal-fired power plants.
\
The requirement for renewable and advanced energy could be suspended once the cost to consumers increases by more than 3 percent, but no utility has yet invoked that cap.
\
""We're not aware of any impact [the Sierra Club campaign] may be having, but we certainly feel their campaign is misleading,"" said FirstEnergy spokesman Doug Colafella.
\
""Like other utilities in Ohio, we have programs that help customers reduce their energy use,"" he said. ""It's a shame that this campaign could mislead customers into missing out on reducing their electric bills by switching to FirstEnergy Solutions.""
\
The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio recently ordered FirstEnergy Corp. to refund $43.3 million to its 2 million customers for overcharging them for renewable energy credits it acquired through its subsidiary to comply with the law. On Wednesday, at the request of multiple parties on both sides, including FirstEnergy, the PUCO agreed to reopen the case.
\
Ohio Sen. Bill Seitz (R., Cincinnati) is expected to introduce a bill sometime this fall to revisit the standards, with the emphasis expected to be primarily on efficiency as opposed to renewable energy.

\
WOOSTER -- Whichever candidate is elected as state representative in the 3rd District will likely take with him some new ideas about education, business and the role of government.
\
Republican Ron Amstutz, who now serves in the Ohio Senate, is running against Democrat Merle Joe Miller for state representative.
\
Both have differing views on the major issues and different goals about how to improve the state's education system and economy.
\
Amstutz said one of the biggest tasks is helping Ohioans become more connected with the workplace. He said internships and similar programs are a necessary means of engaging students with the work world and that such programs should start as early as the sixth-grade.
\
""The seeds for that need to be planted earlier and started earlier,"" he said. ""I think there's a whole lot of students that have no connections for work, all the way through high school even. It's not true for all, but it's true for a lot.""
\
Miller, who is vice president of sales for the Santmyer Oil Co., supports a modified version of President Ronald Reagan's plan to get the most out of school days, school years and curriculum. He advocates extending the school year to about 230 days and the school day by 30-60 minutes.
\
Additionally, Miller said high school students should be required to study four years of English (as most already require), four years of science and math and that foreign language should begin in the sixth grade, possibly the third grade.
\
Miller said these standards would cost more and require more support by educators and communities, but it is the kind of direction he thinks education should go.
\
""That's the kind of effort we need in our education,"" he said.
\
Along with better education, which both candidates said will improve graduates for the demands of today's jobs, both candidates also support the work of BioHio, which they expect to create some of the jobs students pursue.
\
Amstutz said BioHio has already attracted existing businesses, such as Schmack BioEnergy, which produces biogas, and will continue to do so as it develops.
\
""All the major research universities in Ohio and beyond have been pushing to do this,"" Amstutz said. ""It's part of jump-starting our economy. It's not the only thing, by any means, but it's a very important frontier for us to be working in.""
\
Miller said Ohio is behind in its pursuit of alternative energy and acting on a bioenergy standard, which is largely why he's running for office. He said of BioHio that he's ""encouraged that we can encourage research to come in and to do research in our part of the country.""
\
Miller said he has invested in a biodiesel plant in Toledo, expected to begin production in about a month, something he said the local area could also support. He's also working on a project in Toledo to turn seaweed into usable energy, which he said if works there, then it could also work in Wayne County.
\
""We have to encourage this industry to come in,"" Miller said. ""If it's (BioHio) like Toledo, once you get industry in, one thing leads to another.""
\
Amstutz said some of the specific changes he hopes to make are with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and the Bureau of Workers' Compensation.
\
Both, he said, have lost their focus and are hurting the business community, especially medium- to small-sized businesses. The problem with the EPA, he said, is communities are being fined for issues related to paperwork.
\
""We've got to break that cycle because it is a very discouraging thing to our business community when they come up against these almost 'attack fines' from the OEPA,"" Amstutz said.
\
As for Workers' Compensation, Amstutz said the problem isn't in legitimate claims, but instead is in claims that defeat the program's purpose.
\
""It (Worker's Compensation) has a very important purpose, but that purpose has been sidetracked by inappropriate abuse by the trial attorneys,"" Amstutz said.
\
Miller said his biggest focus in the House will be to improve the state's standing with alternative energy, and get it to become more business-oriented.
\
He said the biggest issue is ""inaction from the state government standpoint. Ohio has not been an aggressive state to go out and get industry.""
\
Miller said the state is ""dead last"" in establishing alternative energy for Ohio, which he said is the result of inaction.
\
""I would like to see Ohio go to a minimum (ethanol requirement) of 15 percent, if not 20 percent, on all vehicles the next three-five years,"" he said.
\
Miller said he understands the impact increased ethanol production could have on the area's livestock farmers, who would likely be faced with higher feed bills, but that many also produce their own feed and that more benefit from higher grain prices than do not.
\
""Some of these grain farmers have made more money the past three or four years than they have for years and years,"" Miller said. ""Yes, they (livestock farmers) get hurt in the situation, but you can't scrap the whole thing because a few people get hurt.""
\
Amstutz said the state has adopted a standard with Gov. Ted Strickland's alternative energy standard, which requires that by 2025 at least 25 percent of the state's electricity be produced by advanced energy technology.
\
He said the state has also identified fuel cells as an area Ohio can succeed and has several ongoing efforts already in place, including at Case Western Reserve University.
\
Miller said he plans to apply business principles he gained in the gas industry to the government, and the idea of taking action on whatever front is necessary, reducing the number of government employees and offices, if necessary.
\
""You cannot use this mindset of things will take care of themselves, problems will take care of themselves and do nothing,"" he said. ""You have to go in and take on the problems of the day.""
\
Amstutz said he plans to carry his eight years in the Ohio Senate into office, along with his ""experience, expertise and passion for service."" He spent 20 years as a state representative for this area before becoming a senator.
\
He said he especially plans to work the separation between rural and central urban areas, to ""try to help people in those areas find a way to improve themselves.""

"
4,"LOS ANGELES -- The environmental ministers of Canada and Mexico went to San Francisco last month to sign a global pact -- drafted largely by California -- to lower planet-warming greenhouse pollution. Gov. Jerry Brown flies to China next month to meet with climate leaders there on a campaign to curb global warming. And a battery of state lawyers is preparing to battle any attempt by Washington to weaken California's automobile pollution emission standards. \As President Donald Trump moves to reverse the Obama administration's policies on climate change, California is emerging as the nation's de facto negotiator with the world on the environment. The state is pushing back on everything from White House efforts to roll back pollution rules on tailpipes and smokestacks, to plans to withdraw or weaken the United States' commitments under the Paris climate change accord. \In the process, California is not only fighting to protect its legacy of sweeping environmental protection, but also holding itself out as a model to other states -- and to nations -- on how to fight climate change. \""I want to do everything we can to keep America on track, keep the world on track, and lead in all the ways California has,"" said Brown, who has embraced this fight as he enters what is likely to be the final stretch of a 40-year career in California government. ""We're looking to do everything we can to advance our program, regardless of whatever happens in Washington."" \Since the election, California has stood as the leading edge of the Democratic resistance to the Trump administration, on a range of issues including immigration and health care. Trump lost to Hillary Clinton here by nearly 4 million votes. Every statewide elected official is a Democrat, and the party controls both houses of the Legislature by a two-thirds margin. Soon after Trump was elected, Democratic legislative leaders hired Eric Holder, the former attorney general, to represent California in legal fights with the administration. \But of all the battles it is waging with Washington, none has the global implications of the one over climate change. \The aggressive posture on the environment has set the stage for a confrontation between the Trump administration and the largest state in the nation. California has 39 million people, making it more populous than Canada and many other countries. And with an annual economic output of $2.4 trillion, the state is an economic powerhouse and has the sixth-largest economy in the world. \California's efforts cross party lines. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who served as governor from 2003 to 2011 and led the state in developing the most aggressive pollution-control programs in the nation, has emerged as one of Trump's biggest Republican critics. \Trump and his advisers appear ready for the fight. \Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency chief, whom Trump has charged with rolling back Obama-era environmental policies, speaks often of his belief in the importance of federalism and states' rights, describing Trump's proposals as a way to lift the oppressive yoke of federal regulations and return authority to the states. But of Brown's push to expand California's environmental policies to the country and the world, Pruitt said, ""That's not federalism -- that's a political agenda hiding behind federalism."" \""Is it federalism to impose your policy on other states?"" Pruitt asked in a recent interview in his office. ""It seems to me that Mr. Brown is being the aggressor here. But we expect the law will show this."" \In one of his earliest strikes, Trump signed an executive order aimed at dismantling the Clean Power Plan, President Barack Obama's signature climate policy change. Much of the plan, which Trump denounced as a ""job killer,"" was drawn from environmental policies pioneered in California. \Brown has long been an environmental advocate, including when he first served as governor in the 1970s. He has made this a central focus as he enters his final 18 months in office. In an interview, he said the president's action was ""a colossal mistake and defies science."" \""Erasing climate change may take place in Donald Trump's mind, but nowhere else,"" Brown said. \'Saying you'll bring coal plants back is the past' \The leadership role embraced by California goes to the heart of what has long been a central part of its identity. For more than three decades, California has been at the vanguard of environmental policy, passing ambitious, first-in-the-nation legislation on pollution control and conservation that has often served as models for national and even international environmental law. \""With Trump indicating that he will withdraw from climate change leadership, the rest of the global community is looking to California, as one of the world's largest economies, to take the lead,"" said Mario Molina, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist from Mexico who advises nations on climate change policy. ""California demonstrates to the world that you can have a strong climate policy without hurting your economy."" \The Senate leader, Kevin de Leon, introduced legislation this month that would accelerate, rather than retrench, California's drive to reduce emissions, requiring that 100 percent of retail electricity in the state come from renewable sources by 2045. De Leon said it was ""important that we send a signal to the rest of the world"" at a time of what he described as ""blowback"" from Washington. \Schwarzenegger, who tangled with Trump after the president mocked him for receiving low ratings as his replacement on ""The Apprentice,"" described Trump's environmental policies as a threat to the planet. \""Saying you'll bring coal plants back is the past,"" Schwarzenegger said. ""It's like saying you'll bring Blockbuster back, which is the past. Horses and buggies, which is the past. Pagers back, which is the past."" \He said California had shown it could adopt aggressive environmental policies without hurting the economy. \""We're outdoing the rest of the country on GDP,"" Schwarzenegger said. \How to look ahead \without falling behind? \Even before Trump took office, California's tough regulatory rules had stirred concern among business leaders, who said it had increased their costs. They warned that the situation would become worse if California stood by its regulatory rules while Washington moved in the other direction. \""We're very concerned about that,"" said Robert C. Lapsley, the president of the California Business Roundtable. ""If we are 1 percent of the problem, and we have the most far-reaching climate policies on the planet while all the other states are slowing down because Washington is slowing down, that is going to create an absolute imbalance."" \""Washington will create a less competitive environment for California businesses here because businesses in other states will not have to meet the same mandates,"" he added. ""There is no question that businesses are going to move out."" \The precise contours of this battle will become clear in the months ahead, as Trump's environmental policies take shape. For now, the critical questions are whether the United States will withdraw from the Paris agreement, an international compact to reduce greenhouse pollution, and whether the Environmental Protection Agency will revoke a waiver issued by President Richard M. Nixon that permits California to set fuel economy standards exceeding federal requirements. \Revoking the waiver, which was central to a policy that has resulted in noticeably cleaner air in places like Los Angeles, would force the state to lower its tough fuel economy standards, which are also intended to promote the rapid spread of electric cars. As they stand, the rules would force automakers to build fleets of cars that would reach mileage of 54.5 mpg by 2025. \California is preparing for a legal challenge. \""You have to be concerned when anybody talks about going backward,"" said Xavier Becerra, the state attorney general. ""In this case we think we have a strong case to be made based on the facts and the history."" \Trump is already moving to weaken federal auto emission standards that were influenced by California's tougher standards. Automakers, who met with the president in the Oval Office days after he assumed the presidency, have long complained that the standards forced them to build expensive electric vehicles that consumers may not want. \And the companies have lobbied for years to stop the federal government from allowing California to set cleaner tailpipe regulations than the rest of the nation, arguing that the double standard necessitates building two types of cars. In Detroit, those companies see Trump as their best chance for finally ending onerous California car requirements. But in the meantime, over a dozen other states have adopted California's auto emissions standards -- and Brown is betting that the sheer size of that market will be enough to make the Trump administration reconsider any effort to roll back the California waiver. \""Because we're such a big part of the car market, and places like New York and Massachusetts are tied in with the U.S., our standard will prevail,"" he said. \State helps build 'NAFTA of climate change' \California's signature climate change law is the cap-and-trade program. It places a statewide cap on planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions, and then allows companies to buy and sell pollution credits. The California measure was the model for a national climate law that Obama tried unsuccessfully to have passed in 2010. \Given the setbacks in Washington, California environmental officials are working with Mexico and Canada to create what is informally called the ""NAFTA of climate change"" -- a carbon-cutting program that spans the region. \In April, a delegation from California traveled to Beijing to meet with Chinese counterparts to help them craft a cap-and-trade plan. \The Clean Power Plan was central to the U.S. pledge under the 2015 Paris agreement, which commits the nation to cut its emissions about 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. Now that Trump has moved to roll back the plan, it will be almost impossible for the United States to meet its Paris commitments. \That has resonated powerfully in China. The heart of the Paris agreement was a 2014 deal forged by Obama and President Xi Jinping of China in which the world's two largest economies and largest greenhouse polluters agreed to act jointly to reduce their emissions. \""China is committed to establishing a cap-and-trade this year... and we are looking closely at the California experience,"" said Dongquan He, a vice president of Energy Foundation China, which works with the Chinese government on climate change issues. \Brown recently met with the prime minister of Fiji, who will serve as chairman of this fall's U.N. climate change meeting in Germany, which aims to put the Paris agreement in force, with or without the United States. The governor said he planned to attend as a representative of his state. \""We may not represent Washington, but we will represent the wide swath of American people who will keep the faith on this,"" he said.\Credit: Coral Davenport and Adam Nagourney, (c)2017 The New Rork Times"

6,"WASHINGTON -- When John McCain came to Ohio last week, he gave a fleeting glimpse of what he envisioned life would be like at the end of a hypothetical McCain term in 2013. \The Iraq war, he predicted, would be won. \More free trade agreements would be ratified. \And he would've instituted a cap and trade program aimed at helping to solve global warming. \That's where he and Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, differ. Voinovich has been an outspoken opponent of the Lieberman-Warner cap-and-trade bill, which caps emissions and allow industries to trade their spare emissions credits with companies that need them. McCain has introduced a similar measure, though he has yet to endorse the Lieberman-Warner bill because of concerns that their bill doesn't adequately address nuclear power. \Voinovich, though, argues the Lieberman-Warner bill would decimate Ohio's economy and drive utility costs up by as much as 50 percent. \He said while the United States could institute a cap-and-trade program, it would do nothing to limit emissions in rapidly industrializing nations such as China, where they're bringing two coalfired utility plants up a week. \His approach is vintage Voinovich. He wants to use public diplomacy to push other countries to bring down emissions and argues that the technology isn't there yet for an effective carbon-capture program. His plan, he said, would include a Manhattan Project-style attack aimed at figuring out how to use technology to solve the problem. \""You don't hear me arguing about the facts of the problem,"" he said. \His opinion also differs from Larry Brown of Kettering, a Dayton Audubon Center employee who found himself sitting before a series of congressional aides, making his case to end global warming. \Brown, who describes himself as the type of guy more comfortable talking about birds and rocks than policy, argues someone needs to quickly take a leadership role to solve the problem. He thinks cap-and-trade may be the best answer. \""I take a lot of school groups out, a lot of kids out to see what's going on in world, so they can see the changes happening in habitats and environments,"" he said. ""It's frightening to think of what it's going to be like when they're my age or even older."" \He also views it from a Christian perspective. ""It's a stewardship issue,"" he said. \But to Voinovich, the issue is also one of caring for the people here. He envisions little old ladies unable to afford to keep the lights on, businesses leaving and more people unemployed. It's an emotional issue for him as well. \He agrees there is a problem. It's just how to fix it that's a source of contention. \""I'm confident if we can show that (cap and trade) is not the right approach, then we can come up with a compromise that will put technology first, internationalism first, and get at dealing with the problem,"" he said."
7,"
Among all the issues facing the United States, climate change could be the most important in the long run. It is driving a major debate in Washington over a complex proposal, called ""cap and trade,"" designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
\
If passed by Congress, the plan would change the way companies do business, and would affect the finances and lifestyles of Americans for decades to come.
\
The legislation, sought by President Obama, would cap emissions of carbon dioxide and six other greenhouse gases believed to be a major source of global warming. It also lays out steps to transform the U.S. economy by increasing energy efficiency, using more renewable fuels and developing new technology while lessening reliance on foreign energy sources.
\
Depending on your point of view, the climate change legislation will:
\
Destroy thousands of U.S. jobs as manufacturing moves overseas, or create thousands of ""green"" jobs and restore U.S. competitiveness.
\
Cost consumers hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars annually or cost the average consumer about the price of a postage stamp a day.
\
Combat global warming pollution, or result in more global warming pollution.
\
There's a lot at stake for local businesses and consumers.
\
Because the Cincinnati area relies heavily on coal-fired electricity and has little mass transit, the average resident emitted 3.281 tons of carbon in 2005, third-highest among the nation's 100 largest metropolitan areas, according to a year-old Brookings Institution study. The region's footprint per person increased 12 percent from 2000 to 2005, according to the study.
\
Advocates say climate-change legislation is ultimately more fundamental than reform of health care, the issue dominating recent headlines.
\
""Not to demean the health-care debate, but if our planet isn't habitable it won't make a lot of difference what type of health-care system we have,"" said Joe Mendelson, director of global warming policy for the Washington, D.C.-based National Wildlife Federation. Slowing global warming could have a big impact on limiting the spread of disease and illness and the cost of health care, he said.
\
The House took the first big step toward a cap and trade law June 26, approving 219-212 the massive American Clean Energy and Security Act, capping carbon emissions by major emitters such as refineries, electric and gas suppliers and major industries such as steel and chemicals at 2005 levels starting in 2012. It aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent by 2020 and more than 80 percent by 2050.
\
To ease the transition, the 1,400-page bill creates a complex system of allowances, or permits, for carbon emissions to help the industries met the cap as they move to carbon-free fuels. The allowances, which can be bought and sold, are designed as a market mechanism to spur the development of new and alternative energy sources such as wind, solar, nuclear and still-developing carbon-capture technology.
\
Rep. Steve Driehaus, D-Price Hill, who has defended his vote for the bill in the face of heavy GOP attacks, argues that carbon caps are inevitable in the wake of a Supreme Court decision giving the EPA authority to regulate greenhouse gases. He argues it's better for Congress to set the rules rather than leave it to regulators. And he points to new-energy development provisions in the bill, which a recent study suggested could create more than 80,000 jobs in Ohio.
\
The debate is now moving to the Senate, where the Environment and Public Works Committee, chaired by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., is expected to report its initial language after Labor Day. The full Senate could take up the debate by October.
\
Estimates of the cost to consumers vary widely, but an EPA analysis calculated the cost on the order of $80 to $111 per U.S. household annually. Critics charge the EPA's figures are based on assumptions that are unrealistic or faulty.
\
The House legislation includes language designed to shield ratepayers from major rate increases by requiring emission credits be passed through for ""the benefit of ratepayers."" Last week more than two dozen environmental and consumer groups, including AARP and Ohio Citizen Action, urged the Senate to include a better definition of what that means as well as other consumer protections.
\
Duke Energy Corp., which uses coal to generates about 90 percent of its electricity in the Midwest, says electric rates will rise regardless of climate-change legislation because of higher fuel prices and the need to replace its aging generating plants.
\
The company, which has been active in attempting to craft climate legislation, says factoring in the carbon caps and allowances in the House legislation could mean a 10 percent increase in future electric rates.
\
Some area businesses are skeptical.
\
""I've seen some estimates that our electric rates could increase 56 percent by 2030 when the allowances expire,"" said Ross Bushman, president and chief operating officer of Cast-Fab Technologies, an Oakley metal foundry. Cast-Fab, which employs about 330, operates all-electric furnaces. Dramatically higher electric rates could decimate the U.S. metal-casting industry, he said. ""Cap and trade could drive more production off-shore.""
\
The irony is that a big part of Cast-Fab's business has been producing huge metal housings for utility-scale wind turbines, one of the renewable energy sources climate change advocates are counting on as carbon-based fuels become too expensive.
\
Likewise, Tom Shepherd, chairman and CEO of Shepherd Chemical Co. in Norwood and Shepherd Color Co. in West Chester, says he has ""strong concerns"" about the cap and trade provisions.
\
The family-run companies, which employ about 300 here, produce pigments and specialty chemicals used in a variety of products from automobiles to plastic bags. Shepherd estimates the cost of carbon allowances and higher natural gas rates expected as a result could increase his energy costs by $1 million to $3 million a year.
\
""The problem is that markets for carbon allowances and natural gas aren't global markets,"" he said. ""While our costs increase, there isn't the same pressure on our competitors in India and China.""
\
The Obama administration hopes adopting carbon caps will give the U.S. leverage and leadership when foreign governments meet in December to iron out global limits on carbon emissions, but some manufacturers are skeptical.
\
Developing steelmakers in countries such as Brazil, Russia, India and China ""aren't likely to go along"" with carbon limits, said Alan McCoy, vice president for governmental affairs at West Chester-based AK Steel. ""Without adjustments (on carbon emissions) outside our borders, U.S. steelmakers will be at huge disadvantage.""
\
As more production of steel, chemicals and other commodities moves to regions without carbon caps, global production of greenhouse gases could actually increase, McCoy said.
\
John Stowell, vice president of environmental health and safety policy at Duke Energy in Cincinnati, said that some of the most important parts of the House bill are provisions allowing companies to invest in carbon offsets, doing things such as planting trees and capturing methane gases.
\
""How offsets are treated, counted and verified is a real wild card,"" he said. Offsets are likely to get increased attention as the legislation moves forward in the Senate.
\
Shepherd said ""U.S. manufacturing is the most innovative in the world. We're not going to stand still and get beaten.""
\
Climate change advocates are counting on U.S. innovation to figure out how to prosper in a carbon-constrained world.
\
""They might be right,"" he said. ""But it will be a real disaster if the pace of greenhouse gas reductions is faster than industry's ability to reduce them.""
\
WHAT'S AT STAKE
\
Advocates of cap and trade legislation argue it is the most rational approach to curbing greenhouse gases, from both environmental and economic standpoints. Also, they say that having it in place will give the U.S. leverage in talks later this year to persuade high-polluting nations such as China and India to adopt emission-reduction laws.
\
Opponents argue it will kill manufacturing jobs in states such as Ohio, enrich companies that get carbon credits, drive up the price of energy and goods for consumers, and fail to control emissions anyway.

8,"MANSFIELD -- U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan didn't mince words Friday during a speech to area manufacturers at PR Machine Works Inc.\""This cap and trade is a terrible idea,"" the Urbana Republican said. ""To try to do this anytime is a bad idea, but to do it during a recession is even crazier. It will wind up being the largest tax increase in history for every single American, because every good and service is going to cost more. Your energy is going to cost more and just as important, it's going to cost jobs.""\A cap and trade system is a market-based approach to controlling pollution, allowing corporations or national governments to trade emissions allowances under an overall cap, or limit, on those emissions.\Jordan said the 4th District, which includes Mansfield, Lima, Bellefontaine, Findlay, Sidney and Marion, will be the fourth hardest hit area in the nation.\""It's going to hurt any district that has a heavy reliance on manufacturing. When you look at it, nine of the top 10 are districts in Ohio and Indiana,"" he said. ""If we place this restriction on carbon emissions in the United States, our emerging competitors around the globe, China and India, won't place the same restrictions on themselves.\""But the biggest reason to oppose this is the tax it will place on every single American.""\President Barack Obama supports cap and trade to promote clean energy and to help wean the country from dependence on foreign oil.\""President Obama's budget is up front and honest about the challenges America faces and makes hard choices to bring the deficit down,"" Energy Secretary Steven Chu said. ""At the same time, it invests in our economic future by supporting clean and renewable energy sources that will put Americans back to work while ending our dangerous dependence on foreign oil.""\Mark Romanchuk, owner of PR Machine Works, broke the issue down for the crowd and urged them to work with Jordan.\""Everyone wants to protect our environment and the climate change is certainly a concern, however, many people in Washington only view climate change as an environmental issue, without taking into account the economic ramifications,"" Romanchuk said.\Vice President Zoi Romanchuk explained how the cap and trade proposal would affect PR Machine Works employees.\""This would have a severe and far-reaching negative impact on us,"" she said. ""With this proposal, electricity and gas will go from a lower level expense to challenging health care. This increased expense, combined with the new taxes on raw materials and huge increase in transportation costs, will be a lethal combination to our business. It will limit our ability to be competitive, and will lead to job losses and the erosion of wages and benefit plans.""\Jordan said the legislation has the potential to pass by Memorial Day.\""It's important to do all we can to speak up and let Congress know this is the wrong direction,"" he said.

9," Bush, Kerry present sharp contrast in views\ DAYTON - War and the economy may hold center stage in the presidential race, but environmental policies also put President George Bush and Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry in sharp contrast to one another.\ Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee, and major environmental groups paint the Republican president as an enemy of the environment who is rolling back decades of environmental progress in favor of corporate interests. They say Democrats and moderate Republicans in Congress have held the line against the administration's most egregious environmental attacks, but that four more years of a Bush White House could result in real damage.\ `If the current administration is back in office I think it will continue its efforts to, in their language, `streamline regulations and make them more business-friendly,' ' said Hunt W. Brown, associate director of the Institute for Environmental Quality at Wright State University. `It's my feeling that the administration has gone beyond just trying to make the regulations less onerous. They've sacrificed some of the environmental improvements.'\ Bush and his supporters counter that Kerry's environmental proposals will cost jobs, drive up the price of gasoline and energy and hurt businesses, possibly forcing industries out of the United States.\ They say he does not balance the need for environmental protection with consumer and business needs. And they argue that Kerry's focus on renewable energy sources will not reduce American dependence on fossil fuels because those technologies are decades from being widely available.\ Bush says he supports sensible, not burdensome, regulations to protect the environment without hurting the economy.\ `In the end the Bush policies, because they balance the need for environmental protection with the economy, will actually be implemented in a way that makes a difference in protecting the environment,' said Bill Kovacs, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce vice president for environment, technology and regulatory affairs.\ Clear distinctions\ The differences between the candidates are stark.\ Bush supports drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Kerry opposes it.\ Bush wants to increase the use of nuclear energy and develop hydrogen and thermonuclear energy. Kerry also supports hydrogen and thermonuclear research, but wants no further nuclear energy development until security and waste-disposal issues are resolved.\ Bush wants to store nuclear waste in Yucca Mountain in Nevada. Kerry rejects it as dangerous, both as a site for waste and because it would mean transporting waste across the country to the mountain.\ Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement limiting greenhouse gases, as an unfair burden on the U.S. economy. Kerry wants to reopen negotiations to fix flaws in the protocol, such as its weaker requirements for developing nations.\ Both support continued Superfund clean-up funding and forcing polluters to pay where possible, but Bush wants to boost federal funding and Kerry wants to restore a Superfund tax on industry that expired during Bush's term.\ Bush abandoned President Bill Clinton's rule protecting roadless areas in the national forest. Kerry would restore it and ban logging in old growth forests.\ Bush changed New Source Review rules - which he saw as onerous and counter productive - to make it easier for power plants and other industries to make upgrades without EPA approval or the addition of new pollution-control equipment. Kerry fought those changes.\ Both say they want to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and mercury, but there is raging controversy over whose plan is best and whether new rules would hurt the economy.\ Policies spark reaction\ When it comes to the environment, opinions about the candidates are about as sharply divided as their policies. And while other issues overshadow the environment this election - it didn't even register as a top issue among likely voters in an Ohio Poll this month - Bush's policies draw extreme rancor from environmentalists.\ A Bush campaign official said that reaction is rooted in partisan politics.\ `They're dead wrong. You have to consider who these guys are,' said Mike Catanzaro, the Bush-Cheney campaign's deputy policy director for energy and environment. `Environmental groups. These guys are just arms of the Democratic Party and they don't gives us credit for anything we do.'\ Nonetheless, the League of Conservation Voters - saying Bush's approach demonstrates a bias toward industry and corporate contributors at the expense of public health and safety - gave Bush an `F' for his 2003 performance on the environment.\ Kerry, with a Senate reputation for supporting environmental initiatives, got an `A,' and the league's endorsement. It praises him for voting to strengthen enforcement of the Safe Drinking Water Act and for his plans to boost production of renewal energy sources, such as wind and solar power - production that is part of Kerry's job-creation plan.\ The Union of Concerned Scientists says Bush's actions show an `egregious disregard of scientific study' and `censorship and distortion of scientific analysis.' More than 5,000 scientists - including Nobel laureates and National Medal of Science winners - have signed onto a statement charging the Bush administration with unprecedented `manipulation of the process through which science enters into its decisions.'\ Some environmental experts say Bush has weakened environmental law by rolling back protections, failing to enforce regulations, not defending rules when they're challenged in court and issuing new regulations when the administration can't get broader proposals through Congress.\ It's a `subtle evisceration of existing regulatory programs,' said Heidi Gorovitz Robertson, an associate professor of law and environmental studies at Cleveland State University.\ She said Bush promotes his plans as helpful to the environment, but she contends a closer look shows otherwise.\ Bush calls for increased funding for wetlands. But Robertson said the president's plan redefines the waters of the United States in ways that remove large numbers of waters, including some wetlands, from Clean Water Act protection.\ She also criticized Bush for reversing Clinton's efforts to clean up mining. Robertson said Bush allows mountain-top mining, a `severe form of mining' that involves chopping off the top of mountains and dumping the debris into the valley below.\ Bush says his Healthy Forest Initiative is key to removing forest undergrowth and dead trees to reduce fuel for wildfires.\ But environmentalists say the law is a ruse to allow more logging and is being used in remote areas where wildfires do not threaten communities.\ Opponents take particular aim at what they believe are the administration's efforts to undermine the Clean Air Act.\ Kerry contends Bush's plan rolls back existing protections, a claim hotly denied by the Bush campaign.\ Support for Bush\ Bush administration policies find favor with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which does not endorse candidates.\ The chamber favors his Clean Air and Healthy Forest initiatives, opposes the Kyoto Protocol and supports every provision in Bush's energy bill, which has yet to pass Congress, said Kovacs, the chamber vice president.\ The Bush campaign says Kerry's plans would decimate the coal industry, keep America dependent on foreign oil, destroy jobs and raise energy prices for everyone.\ The campaign also says Bush has a strong environmental record.\ The president raised fuel-efficiency standards for SUVs by 1.5 miles per gallon for model years 2005-2007 and reduced diesel fuel emissions for equipment used in construction, agriculture and industry - a move praised by the League of Conservation Voters.\ Bush also supported a brownfields bill to help reclaim old industrial sites and approved clean-up of the Hudson River and Great Lakes, Catanzaro said.\ Bush is critical of regulations that hurt the economy and believes `the greatest environmental progress will come about, not through endless lawsuits or command-and-control regulations, but through technology and innovation,' said Kevin Madden, campaign spokesman.\ Bush's criticism of cumbersome regulations rings true to John LeBlanc, associate professor of management at Cedarville University.\ LeBlanc spent 30 years in manufacturing before becoming a professor, and said environmental regulations were a paperwork nightmare.\ And, said LeBlanc, one reason gasoline prices are high is because oil refineries have closed rather than make expensive upgrades.\ Kovacs said business already spends $200 billion annually on environmental protection. He couldn't estimate what Kerry's plans would cost, but said if Kerry wins and has a Republican Congress, `I don't think Kerry can do much.'\ Debating the details\ The debate over environmental policies extends to the regulations themselves, where there is disagreement over what proposed rules might mean.\ Take, for example, power plant emissions. Both Bush and Kerry proposed cutting emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury. Kerry has set no specific targets, while Bush says his plan would reduce emissions by 70 percent over 15 years. Environmentalists question the claims of a 70 percent reduction and say they plan does too little and over too long a period of time.\ They're particularly upset about the mercury rule, which they say rolls back existing protections.\ Catanzaro denies that and says there is no current law governing mercury.\ In reality, there is a rule on the books limiting mercury emissions for industry and power plants, but the standards don't have to be met until December 2006, said Linda Oros, spokeswoman for Ohio EPA.\ Bush's plan for mercury, now under review by the U.S. EPA, would set a cap on mercury emissions but allow plants that don't meet standards to make trades with plants that do.\ Oros said `the way that it's written now it's not' more stringent than current rules on mercury, and the Ohio EPA has informed the U.S. EPA that it would only support the cap-and-trade model if it is at least as stringent as the mercury limits that are to be in place by 2006.\ Presidential candidates typically claim a love for the environment and a commitment to protecting it.\ But Robertson said she cannot remember a race for president where the two candidates were so divided on environmental issues.\ `When you listen to the words that come out of Bush and the words that come out of Kerry, they don't sound all that different,' Robertson said. `But when you dig a little bit deeper comparing Bush's actions to Kerry's voting record they're worlds apart on the environment.'\ Contact Lynn Hulsey at 225-7455.\ MORE INSIDE\ * Bush to visit area/B4\ * Debate preview/A14\ * Registration up/A13\ MORE ONLINE\ * GeorgeWBush.com\ * JohnKerry.com"
10,"
Driehaus, part of the slim 219 to 212 majority for the American Clean Energy and Security Act, deflected critics who say the legislation now going to the Senate will mean the elimination of U.S. jobs. The bill, which was sent to the Senate, would reduce carbon emissions by 83 percent by 2050,
\
""There's a lot of misinformation going around,"" he said adding that the legislation will mean the creation of ""thousands"" of jobs in Ohio as manufacturers produce equipment for renewable and clean energy projects. A recent MIT study for the Center for American Progress estimated the climate bill and federal stimulus money combined would create more than 67,000 jobs in Ohio.
\
""Ohio has the resources and workforce to be at the cutting edge as we move our nation toward a clean energy economy, and this bill will promote investments that will bring the potential of clean energy development,"" said Driehaus, D-West Price Hill.
\
Duke, which relies on coal for about 90 percent of its Midwest electric generation, supports climate legislation.
\
""You might wonder why, given our heavy dependence on coal for electric generation, Duke Energy would be such a staunch supporter of legislation to reduce carbon emissions,"" said Julie Janson, president of Duke Energy Ohio and Kentucky.
\
""In our judgment, the question is settled whether carbon regulation is coming.,"" she said.
\
A 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision opened the door for EPA regulation. Without congressional action for a transition to a lower carbon environment, Driehaus said, the only alternative would be more draconian EPA regulation.
\
He also defended controversial ""cap and trade"" provisions of the bill, limiting emissions but allocating credits to larger polluters such as Duke while they transition to cleaner technology.
\
""Cap and trade"" worked in the 1990s Clean Air Act allowing Duke to install scrubbers limiting nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide from the four coal-fired boilers at the Miami Fort plant, he said.
\
""That's the kind of ingenuity we need to bring to climate change,"" he said.
\
Duke, lobbied hard against an earlier version of the climate bill requiring a federal auction to the highest bidder of most of the carbon credits, a move it said could raise electric rates in Ohio and Kentucky by 25 or 30 percent.
\
The version approved by the House would allocate rather than auction 85 percent of the credits. Driehaus said that should mean no more than a 5-10 percent increase in electric rates.
\
Janson said the climate bill while not perfect ""lays the foundation for our nation to start transforming our energy infrastructure.""
"
11,"Congress seems to know all about science, like what medical treatments can be used by doctors.\When it comes to climate change, they might look to scientists who study the subject instead of Al Gore's computer. A book by Ian Plimer, ""Heaven and Earth,"" might be a place to start to learn about climate change over millions of years instead of just a few. If this book doesn't help, take a look at ""The Real Global Warming Disaster,"" by Christopher Booker, who writes a column in The Sunday Telegraph and is living with cap and trade in England.\In short, cap and trade could be better titled ""Tax and Spend."" Alternative energies are a fine idea and should be used more as they become better developed and more efficient.\In the meantime, let's use what is available: coal, gas, oil, nuclear and hydraulic power. How about drilling for oil in our state and national parks and off shore, like the Chinese are doing off Cuba. Maybe the revenue from these sources could help reduce the tax burden on us. Let oil companies build new refineries, I suggest in Mid-America, where the oil reserves are in our country.\The big thing is to become more informed about the environment and how it works from people who have studied it and know how it works. The latest attack on carbon dioxide is without thought or knowledge. How would plants live without it, and how would we live without plants?\Congress should become informed. Computer studies only give you the answers from the information that has been inputted. They need to quit spending money we don't have, pay back the debt with the money being paid back by those to whom it was loaned and not to spend the appropriated money yet unspent!"

WASHINGTON - In this economy, the nation's farmers are wining some, losing some and, more than anything else, taking what they can get.
\
More than 80 Ohio farmers descended on Washington this week for the Ohio Farm Bureau's annual trek to lobby legislators and catch up on the latest issues facing the family farm. That update included a few wins in the past year, but an equal number of issues on which they may have to settle for less than they had hoped.
\
In the win column, at least temporarily, was the long-running battle over the estate tax. After 10 years of gradual transition, the tax ceiling hit a high of $3.5 million per person this year and is scheduled for repeal next year before returning to a $1 million ceiling in 2011. However, Pat Wolff, director of the American Farm Bureau's tax policy team told the group that Congress would likely act before that happens.
\
""We are pretty sure that Congress is going to enact legislation on the estate tax yet this year. They don't want a repealed tax because then when they re-enact it, it's a tax increase,"" Wolff said.
\
Neither Republicans nor Democrats have the votes in the Senate to get their way on the tax, so it's likely to end in a compromise, Wolff said. President Barack Obama has said he would support a permanent $3.5 million ceiling. The Farm Bureau is shooting for $10 million. But either way, a permanent solution beats what they have now.
\
""We're looking at something less than repeal, but we're looking at something permanent,"" Wolff said. ""You can say that's a good thing or a bad thing. It's certainly not all we want, but at least it puts a floor on it.""
\
The estate tax probably will not be the only place the Bureau settles for a compromise in the coming year. The Obama administration has placed a new emphasis on environmental issues, meaning a climate change bill is on the horizon. The mostly conservative farm community is less than enthusiastic about the administration's ""cap and trade"" plan, but it's starting to look inevitable, said Rick Krause, AFB's senior director of congressional relations.
\
""Basically, it's moving forward with or without us. I think we'll be able to stop anything this year, maybe next year, depending on how the economy goes, but these people are bent on doing it,"" Krause said.
\
Farm Bureau lobbyists are pushing to see farmers included in the trade portion of cap and trade, meaning they would be able to sell offsets to other businesses to help counter the likely taxes on fuels and fertilizers.
\
""We want to make sure an offset provision is included in any legislation,"" Krause said. ""We're just trying to get the best deal for our farmers and ranchers.""
"
13,"In Pope Francis' sprawling new encyclical, ""Laudato Si',"" there are many mansions: a meditation on biblical ecology, a discussion of environmental policy, a critique of consumerism, even a reflection on the perils of social media. \What everyone wants to know, of course, is whether the pope takes sides in our most polarizing debate. After this document, there's no doubting where Francis stands in the great argument of our time. \But I don't mean the argument between liberalism and conservatism. I mean the argument between dynamists and catastrophists. \Dynamists are people who see 21st-century modernity as a basically successful civilization advancing toward a future that's better than the past. They believe we can innovate our way through problems. \Catastrophists, on the other hand, see a global civilization that for all its achievements is becoming more atomized and balkanized, more morally bankrupt, more environmentally despoiled. They believe that the trajectory we're on will end in crisis, disaster, degringolade. \They're united in believing that current arrangements are foredoomed and that only a true revolution can save us. \This is Pope Francis' position and the controlling theme of his encyclical. It includes, as many liberals hoped and certain conservatives feared, a call to action against climate change. \But reading ""Laudato Si'"" simply as a case for taking climate change seriously misses the depth of its critique -- which extends to the whole ""technological paradigm"" of our civilization, all the ways (economic and cultural) that we live now. \This is a document aligned with the scientific consensus on climate that excoriates the modern scientific mindset as, in effect, a 500-year mistake. It's a document calling for a ""new world political authority,"" that's drenched in frank contempt for the existing global leadership class. It urges a rapid move away from fossil fuels while explicitly criticizing the leading avenue for doing so -- a cap-and-trade regime -- as too ""quick and easy,"" too compromised by greed and self-interest, to ""allow for the radical change which present circumstances require."" \And while it includes hopeful passages, the encyclical's most pungent lines are apocalyptic: ""Doomsday predictions can no longer be met with irony or disdain. We may well be leaving to coming generations debris, desolation and filth."" \This pungency is what really distinguishes ""Laudato Si'"" from prior papal documents \It's possible to believe that climate change is happening while doubting that it makes ""the present world system ... certainly unsustainable,"" as the pope suggests. Perhaps ""radical change"" can, in fact, be persistently postponed. \Indeed, perhaps our immediate future fits neither the dynamist nor the catastrophist framework. \We might have entered a kind of stagnationist position, a sustainable decadence. \In that case, the deep critique our civilization deserves will have to be advanced without the threat of imminent destruction. The arguments in ""Laudato Si'"" \, they will have to be structured around a different peril: not a fear that the particular evils of our age can't last, but the fear that actually, they can."

With President-elect Barack Obama taking over the White House and Democrats solidifying their control over Congress, utilities are bracing for a cap-and-trade program that rewards those firms that generate electricity without spewing so much carbon dioxide.
\
Carbon dioxide is the chief greenhouse gas associated with global warming. Under a cap-and-trade program, the government would limit releases of that pollutant for each utility.
\
Utilities prefer that program over a straight tax on carbon emissions because it provides incentives for efficiency. Under cap-and-trade, they would be allowed to buy or sell emission credits depending upon whether they can stay below their limits.
\
The program - one that Mr. Obama said he supports - is targeted at reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants. As America's largest source of electricity, but also its greatest source of carbon dioxide, coal-fired power plants produce half of the nation's power and almost 90 percent of power within industry-heavy Ohio.
\
Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp., which serves much of northern Ohio, figures it is in a good position to comply with whatever regulations come out of the next Congress because 40 percent of the power it generates in Ohio comes from its two nuclear plants, said Ellen Raines, a utility spokesman.
\
""We have a much more balanced portfolio,"" she said.
\
Nuclear accounts for 20 percent of America's electricity.
\
FirstEnergy owns the Davis-Besse nuclear plant near Oak Harbor, Ohio, the Perry plant east of Cleveland in Lake County, and the twin-reactor Beaver Valley nuclear complex in western Pennsylvania. Via merger several years ago, it also inherited the mothballed Three Mile Island Unit 2 facility near Harrisburg, Pa., site of the nation's worst nuclear accident in 1979.
\
Nuclear plants don't emit carbon dioxide during operations, though their critics say they cannot be considered a panacea for climate change because of the enormous energy that is expended mining and packaging the uranium that fuels reactor cores. The plants also require tons of concrete and steel to be built and maintained, all of which expends carbon dioxide.
\
The United States produces more carbon dioxide than any other country on a per capita basis, although China in 2007 surpassed America as the world's leading emitter in volume.
\
Faced by mounting pressure to either become less reliant on coal or operate more efficiently, the last Congress saw a smattering of proposals to regulate carbon dioxide
\
One was introduced in the
\
Senate by Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), and former Democratic vice presidential hopeful Joe Lieberman, now a Connecticut senator registered as an independent. The McCain-Lieberman bill of 2007 was endorsed by both Mr. Obama and his rival in this year's Democratic primary, Sen. Hillary Clinton (D., N.Y.). The measure, however, died in committee.
\
Last summer, a similar bill introduced by Mr. Lieberman and Sen. John Warner (R., Va.) became the first to make it out of committee. It failed to pass the full Senate.
\
Dingell's influence
\
The senior member of the House, Rep. John Dingell (D., Dearborn), whose 15th Congressional District includes Monroe County, said Thursday in a letter to the Democratic Caucus that his interest in climate legislation is one reason he will seek another term as chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
\
""An Obama presidency will allow us to quickly complete our work and protect the environment,"" Mr. Dingell wrote, adding that he supports an 80 percent reduction in carbon emissions.
\
""We cannot regain the skilled, high-paying manufacturing jobs around the country that George W. Bush exported until there is regulatory certainty on this matter and each day we fail to provide that is one more day before business starts reinvesting in America,"" Mr. Dingell wrote.
\
The Democrats picked up five seats in the Senate, widening their margin to a 57-40 majority. They also gained 19 seats in the House, where they will hold a 255-174 majority come January.
\
Ms. Raines said utilities such as FirstEnergy analyze each bill, though they will have a hard time calculating meaningful cost estimates until they have a better idea of what will emerge.
\
""Obviously, it's premature to say what kind of impact [a cap-and-trade program] will have on us,"" she said. ""We'll certainly be interested in what the new administration does with carbon legislation.""
\
Power-plant project
\
So what effect has the buzz over climate legislation had on existing projects, such as the coal-fired power plant that American Municipal Power-Ohio is planning to build in southern Ohio's Meigs County?
\
None so far.
\
Although AMP-Ohio said last week that its latest cost projection of $3.3 billion is $400 million more than the project's $2.9 billion estimated cost in January, it cited the rising cost of steam turbines and boilers as one of the biggest reasons.
\
AMP-Ohio is a nonprofit wholesale power supplier founded in 1971 to negotiate electric rates for its 120 member communities spread across Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Virginia, and West Virginia.
\
Twenty-five are in northwest Ohio, including Bowling Green, Napoleon, Bryan, Clyde, Deshler, Edgerton, Elmore, Genoa, Montpelier, Oak Harbor, Haskins, Holiday City, Pemberville, Pioneer, Sycamore, and Woodville.
\
The potential impact of the Lieberman-Warner bill was factored into the latest cost estimate. So was the need for $80 million to help guard against unexpected costs, said Kent Carson, AMP-Ohio spokesman.
\
Many people expect Congress to pass something tougher than the limits that would have been established under the Lieberman-Warner bill.
\
Mr. Obama pledged during the campaign to put America on a path toward reducing carbon-dioxide emissions by 80 percent by 2050, compared to 1990 levels.
\
""It's hard to define something by a standard that doesn't exist,"" Mr. Carson said. ""To the extent [the cost of a cap-and-trade program] could be factored in, it has been.""
\
AMP-Ohio is in final negotiations with a company it considers to be its preferred contractor for the project. It will be revealed after the contract is signed.
\
The rush to build power plants in developing countries, such as China and India, has ""overwhelmed"" steam turbine manufacturers, said Marc Gerken, AMP-Ohio president and chief executive officer.
\
That has pushed AMP-Ohio's anticipated startup of the new plant back to 2014, about six months later than planned. Barring any other delays construction is expected to start late next year, Mr. Carson said.
\
1,000 megawatts
\
The plant would produce 1,000 megawatts, slightly more than Davis-Besse and a little less than what DTE Energy's Fermi 2 nuclear plant northeast of Monroe produces. A single megawatt provides enough electricity for about 1,000 homes.
\
When the project was announced in October, 2005, the cost was pegged at $1.2 billion.
\
AMP-Ohio hopes to keep the plant's carbon emissions down with pollution-control technology known as Powerspan, developed by a New Hampshire company to control sulfur dioxide. Some believe it has potential as a carbon-capture device.
\
The technology is under research at FirstEnergy's Berger plant in eastern Ohio, the focus of $18.1 million of studies into how carbon emissions might someday be captured and sequestered underground in the Midwest.
\
A waste byproduct of Powerspan is ammonia sulfate, which can be crystallized into a fertilizer.
\
AMP-Ohio announced last year that it signed a memorandum of understanding with The Andersons of Maumee to crystallize, package, and sell the material.
\
Regardless how well Powerspan performs in removing carbon from the waste stream, AMP-Ohio believes the Meigs County facility will operate more efficiently than older coal-fire power plants ""simply because it's newer,"" Mr. Carson said.

THE health-care debate has been so combustible that the political fire is in danger of sucking the oxygen out of other important congressional business. That can't be allowed to occur, because the other concern about health - that of the planet - will only be hurt by delay.
\
On June 26, the House of Representatives passed, by a narrow margin of 219-212, the American Clean Energy and Security Act, HR 2454, which would wean the nation away from fossil fuels with incentives to encourage alternative energy sources such as wind and solar.
\
The payoff would come at several levels: the creation of new jobs in green industries, greater national security by lessening the nation's reliance on importing oil from dubious foreign regimes, and reduction of global warming gases. And, of course, less pollution also benefits the overall health of the American people.
\
Using a cap-and-trade system - a limit would be set on overall emissions, but companies could buy or sell credits to comply - the bill would reduce emissions in stages resulting in an 83 percent reduction over 40 years. While climate change still has its skeptics, despite the ever-growing body of evidence, even the Pentagon has become concerned about the implications of a planet convulsed by global warming-linked upheavals.
\
Before health care became demagoguery's cause du jour, the climate bill was the focus of dire predictions that are sure to be soon revived. The critics say cap-and-trade is just a tax increase on businesses. No, it is a market mechanism offered as a more palatable alternative to a direct carbon tax.
\
Critics say that it will bankrupt the country, but the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost per household by 2020 will be only $175, which is less than the likely rise in the cost of cable TV over that period.
\
They say it will kill jobs, but the potential for job growth is huge. A recent study by a project of the Pew Charitable Trusts found that green energy jobs are already exploding at a rate of 9.1 percent a year. More than 35,000 Ohioans already have clean-energy jobs.
\
It is not only environmentalists who support this bill. Groups with a personal stake in jobs and a good economy, ranging from the United Steelworkers to Alcoa, are backing the bill as a reasonable and much-needed step for the nation.
\
It is now up to the Senate. Supporters of the bill expect it to be introduced in the Committee on the Environment and Public Works shortly after the summer recess, next Tuesday or Wednesday.
\
This bill is good for the planet and for America's place in it. It cannot be allowed to die.

Rob Portman, the GOP candidate to replace U.S. Sen. George Voinovich (R., Ohio), toured a Holland business yesterday and denied Democratic attacks that he had ""flip-flopped"" on energy legislation.
\
Democrats claimed Mr. Portman's newest campaign commercial in opposition to the Democratic-backed cap-and-trade bill contradicts a position he took in a column he wrote in 1996.
\
""Congressman Portman is running from the 20 years he spent in Washington pushing trade policies that outsourced Ohio jobs,"" Haley Morris, a spokesman for the Ohio Democratic Party, said. ""The only thing Ohioans learn about Congressman Portman from this ad is that his positions go whichever way the wind blows.""
\
Mr. Portman said Democrats were mixing apples and oranges, and said he had never supported anything like the cap-and-trade bill that he said would be devastating to Ohio businesses.
\
In a 1996 column, Mr. Portman said that, ""Private-sector incentives, such as permitting companies to trade discharge outputs, can reduce both pollution and costs.""
\
A key aspect of the cap-and-trade bill in Congress is that businesses which emit fewer greenhouse gases than they are allowed could sell those emissions credits to other businesses.
\
""Cap and trade is not a voluntary exchange of permits. It's a huge new tax. It will be terrible for Ohio,"" Mr. Portman said. ""We're particularly hit hard by cap and trade because we have a lot of coal. Over 85 percent of us get our electricity from coal. This'll cost 100,000 jobs in Ohio if it passes.""
\
Mr. Portman, a former Cincinnati-area congressman as well as former trade representative and budget director under President George W. Bush, is running against Ohio Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher, a Democrat, for the Senate seat.
\
In his TV commercial - his second of the campaign - Mr. Portman said ""there's a better way"" to stop the dependence on foreign oil, create jobs, and have a cleaner environment. He called for the United States to invest in oil exploration, natural gas, nuclear energy, and alternative energy sources.
\
Lucas County Commissioner Pete Gerken voiced the Democratic theme of the day in a hastily called news conference outside the Brennan Industrial Truck Co. in Holland, where Mr. Portman was talking to workers.
\
""Now he says cap and trade doesn't work. Ten years ago, he called it incentives to accomplish virtually the same thing,"" he said.

AS AN ISSUE in the presidential campaign, the environment is a multi-headed monster, with climate change and energy policy two of its faces. As most environmentalists will tell you, the years of the Bush Administration have not been kind to their cause. Just the opposite, in fact.
\
This is an administration, after all, led by former oil industry executives. Its energy policy was formed in a secret meeting convened by Vice President Dick Cheney with energy company executives. In the face of changing public opinion, it has moved from being obstructionist on efforts to curb global warming to paying lip service to its reality and the need to meet its challenges.
\
But actions speak louder than words. When California recently decided to go beyond federal standards in limiting vehicle emissions to cut greenhouse gases, the Environmental Protection Agency refused permission, which stymied the efforts of other states.
\
This decision confounded a core conservative belief that states should be free to make their own decisions, but it also underscored a defining value of this administration: When it comes to the environment, the conserve in conservative means protecting business interests first.
\
For the major candidates seeking their party's nomination for president, the environment is another issue that reflects an ideological divide.
\
Sen. Barack Obama, now the Democratic front-runner, is a true believer in global warming and he pledges to make combating it one of the top priorities of his administration.
\
On his Web site, which links energy and the environment, he cites a speech he gave in Des Moines in October in which he called climate change ""one of the greatest moral challenges of our generation."" He supports a market-based cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2050.
\
The senator from Illinois calls for investing $150 billion over 10 years in clean energy, including focusing on the next generation of biofuels and investing in low-emission coal plants. He would seek to change the cars Americans drive and the fossil fuels they burn, encouraging hybrid vehicles and raising fuel efficiency standards. He would require that 25 percent of the energy used in the United States by 2025 come from clean, sustainable sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal.
\
Sen. Hillary Clinton is very much in tune with her Democratic rival. She too favors a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, stronger energy and auto fuel-economy standards, and a large increase in funding for green research. She would set up a $50 billion Strategic Energy Fund, to be paid for partly by oil companies, in order to make investments in alternative energy.
\
She too wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but by 80 percent by 2050. She favors renewable energy generating 25 percent of electricity by 2025, and she supports a drive to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent from current projections by 2020.
\
The senator from New York is not to be out-wonked on any issue, especially energy and the environment. Her list of goals seems to incorporate every conceivable idea. For example, she would require that all federal buildings designed after Jan. 20, 2009, be zero-emission buildings.
\
Sen. John McCain is not the darling of conservative elements in his Republican Party, and his attitude on global warming is one reason. He is not afraid to say that he thinks it is real.
\
His Web site has a section titled ""Stewards of Our Nation's Rich Natural Heritage"" - itself an encouraging sign - which lauds his ""proud record of common sense stewardship"" and ""his commitment to clean air and water and to conserving open space.""
\
He believes that ""America's economic and environmental interests are not mutually exclusive, but rather inextricably linked. Our economic prospects depend greatly upon the sustainable use of ample and unspoiled natural resources. A clean and healthy environment is well-served by a strong economy. History shows that poverty is a poor steward.""
\
Encouraging stuff, but it is longer on noble intentions than practical details or goals. It's an open question whether the senator from Arizona, as a self-proclaimed conservative, would crack the whip on industries when it needs to be cracked. He supports a market-based cap-and-trade system to achieve limits on greenhouse gas emissions and stands for energy efficiency in general.
\
Mike Huckabee clearly isn't worried about global warming, although he does acknowledge a duty for humans to be good stewards of the planet. The former governor of Arkansas sees energy independence as a global security issue. He would support oil drilling in some of America's most vulnerable place, while at the same time promoting alternative energy sources.
\
The environment, in its attendant guises of energy policy and climate change, may not capture as many daily headlines as the war in Iraq and the withering economy. But in the long run a warming planet and a deteriorating environment threaten major trouble.
\
The Blade favors bold, aggressive steps to correct past follies and decades of denial. Fortunately, it seems that whoever wins in November will do better than the Bush Administration in facing up to the problem.

\
WOOSTER -- A staple on campaign trails are promises, and the latest representative of Ohio's 16th Congressional District made his share of them on the stump.
\
In an analysis by The Daily Record of video from debates in Wayne County and newspaper articles, newly sworn-in U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, a Wadsworth Republican, made about 20 campaign promises, likely more when you consider all of the surveys and questionnaires he filled out.
\
Among the most repeated were his intent to repeal and replace the health care reform legislation passed by the 111th Congress, permanently repeal the estate tax, cut taxes and cut spending.
\
Renacci wants to repeal and replace the health care reform law because he said it did nothing to address costs and 85 percent of the problems in health care are cost-related. He suggested some type of tort reform and allowing health insurance policies to be purchased across state lines to drive up competition and drive down prices. Renacci agreed with some parts of the law, like providing a safety net for people, eliminating pre-existing conditions and doing away with some of the limits on services.
\
Renacci repeatedly addressed health care reform, which he often labeled Obamacare, and cap-and-trade, a trading system designed to reduce emissions and reduce dependence upon foreign oil. Renacci vowed to oppose cap-and-trade legislation, saying it was a job-killing bill because it would increase energy costs for Ohio's residents and businesses because of the state's reliance on coal for power generation.
\
""Any congressman in the state of Ohio who voted for cap and trade should never be allowed to go back to Washington,"" Renacci said during a League of Women Voters candidates' forum in October.
\
Renacci said he supports an ""all of the above"" energy policy, including using nuclear, clean coal, wind, biofuels and domestic oil drilling.
\
During a debate sponsored by the Wooster Area Chamber of Commerce Coalition for the Support of Business and Jobs, Renacci said the single-most important legislation needed would be a law to cap discretionary spending at 20 percent of GDP, an idea proposed by Congressman Mike Pence, an Indiana Republican who spoke at a Renacci fundraiser during the campaign.
\
""Some think you can spend your way into prosperity,"" Renacci said on the trail. He said the 20 percent cap would not affect Social Security, the military or veterans benefits.
\
Less spending fits with his goals of less government and less taxes. Controlling spending, getting government ""out of the way"" and reducing tax burdens will help to create an environment where small business owners will be willing to risk capital and make investments again, which will lead to more jobs, Renacci said on the trail.
\
Renacci also supports a permanent repeal of the estate tax, which he often called the ""death tax.""
\
He said small business owners and farmers pay taxes their whole life, and then the government takes as much as 55 percent of their estates upon death. He said eliminating the estate tax will help in allowing farms to pass from one generation to the next. Renacci said he knows of families who have had to sell the farm or split it and sell off parcels in order to pay the estate tax.
\
During the League of Women Voters event, Renacci said the tax code and tax forms need to be simplified, and the result should be a net tax reduction for individuals and corporations.
\
Renacci views repealing and replacing health care, defeating cap-and-trade and lowering taxes as ways to provide small business owners with some predictability and certainty that will spur investment and expansion and, ultimately, jobs.
\
He also vowed to hold town hall meetings and listen to the people, whether they agree or not. Renacci also wants to provide excellent constituent services in the tradition of former Congressman Ralph Regula.
\
Renacci told voters during the campaign that if a congressman violates the trust of constituents, he should not be returned to office. Here are his promises, and let the voters decide in two years if he upheld his promises or violated their trust.

COLUMBUS -- A state lawmaker from Holmes County and a former Ashland County commissioner are the latest Republicans eyeing congressional seats held by Democrats.
\
Rep. Bob Gibbs, a Republican from Lakeville, said he plans to make a formal announcement, probably early next month, on his intentions to seek the party nomination to face Zack Space, representing Ohio's 18th District. The district includes all or parts of 16 counties and stretches from Jackson in the south to Holmes in the north.
\
And Matt Miller will make his third attempt to gain the Republican nomination for the 16th District seat, held by freshman Democrat John Boccieri. The district includes Ashland, Medina, Wayne and Stark counties.
\
Multiple other Republicans already have announced their intentions to seek party nominations for the seats, as well, setting up competitive primaries in May 2010. Gibbs has not made his candidacy official yet, and he's still contacting party chairman in each of the counties in the district. But he said Friday he's fed up with the direction the country is taking, mentioning federal cap-and-trade policies that will increase energy costs while doing nothing to protect the environment.
\
""Zack Space is just not representing the district,"" he said.
\
Gibbs, a former state representative, is in his first term in the Ohio Senate. He would retain that seat during the campaign and afterward if his election attempt is unsuccessful.
\
Miller served two terms as an Ashland County Commissioner. He ran against former Congressman Ralph Regula in the 2006 primary and fared well in his home county, outpacing the longtime incumbent by three-to-one. But he lost the overall district to Regula, who went on to re-election.
\
Miller faced state Sen. Kirk Schuring in the 2008 primary and won Ashland, Medina and Wayne counties. But he fell short in Stark and lost the party nomination to Schuring, who eventually lost to Boccieri.
\
Miller said he will focus his campaigning efforts on Stark County, building on the name recognition he's established over the past four years in the district.
\
""The issues I ran on four years ago haven't changed,"" he said. ""They've intensified. It's become even more critical that we address them.""
\
He added in a released statement, ""Today we launch our campaign for freedom; freedom from excessive taxation, freedom from out-of-control government spending, and freedom from job-killing government regulations. Soaring budget deficits and increased government control of our lives has not and will not improve our economy and put Americans back to work.""
\
Miller is currently the business administrator at the Salvation Army Ray & Joan Kroc Corps Community Center in Ashland.

""Restoring nature to its natural state is a cause beyond party and beyond factions. It has become a common cause of all the people of this country."" - Richard Nixon in his State of the Union Address on Jan. 22, 1970, three months before 20 million Americans took part in the first Earth Day.
\
Does it matter that neither Barack Obama nor John McCain is a slam dunk for the environmental vote?
\
At first glance, Mr. Obama appears to have a lock on it - at least in the Great Lakes region. Being from Illinois, he's one of us. He even pledged $5 billion to get a $20 billion Great Lakes restoration plan moving. That, of course, was before the world's financial markets went kaput.
\
David Jenkins of Republicans for Environmental Protection summed the situation up well at the recent Society of Environmental Journalists conference in Roanoke, Va., when he said conservatives need to embrace the conservation ethic of Republican Teddy Roosevelt, whom many view as our nation's first true environmental president.
\
He also said they need to disassociate themselves from the ""irresponsible rants by Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter.""
\
""If we're to consistently improve the quality of our environment in the long term, environmental issues need to become less polarized,"" Mr. Jenkins said. ""More blue doesn't mean more green.""
\
America has come full circle and taken a harder look at energy and the environment, just like it did in 1970. Yet those issues were nonexistent during the primaries. They took off after gasoline surpassed the $4-a-gallon mark this summer.
\
Mr. McCain called for the Outer Continental Shelf's 30-year drilling ban to be lifted. He called for 45 more nuclear plants by 2030, though - at a cost of $10 billion to $15 billion per plant for an industry that's never built one without massive federal subsidies - the taxpayer burden has never been fully explored.
\
The New York Times, which also has been campaigning for more nukes, took Mr. Obama to task in a front-page article Feb. 8. It claimed he didn't live up to his bravado after vowing to get tough with utilities following the 2004 discovery of radioactive tritium leaks at Exelon's Braidwood power station some 60 miles southwest of Chicago. The newspaper said his bill fizzled, giving way to a voluntary reporting program pushed by the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's chief lobbyist group on Capitol Hill.
\
The nation's latest episode with tritium leakage is at FirstEnergy Corp.'s Davis-Besse nuclear plant 30 miles east of Toledo, where workers stumbled upon the problem Oct. 22 only because a cracked drainage pipe passed through an area where they had been inspecting fire-suppression equipment.
\
Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain both vow to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that cause global warming, whether more nuclear's in the mix or not. They favor a cap-and-trade program in which utilities would have a greater incentive to be efficient. Mr. Obama is seeking an 80 percent reduction in those emissions over 1990 levels by 2050, while Mr. McCain endorses a 60 percent reduction.
\
For what it's worth, the League of Conservation Voters (www.lcv.org) just issued its latest environmental scorecard. Campaigning apparently kept Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain from voting on 11 key environmental Senate bills the group identified. It claims Mr. Obama has voted pro-environment 72 percent of the time during his short career in the Senate, while Mr. McCain has voted pro-environment only 24 percent of the time during his long tenure there.
\
Mr. Nixon said in his 1970 speech that clean air, clean water, and open spaces ""should once again be the birthright of every American.""
\
Will they be under the next presidency?

PRESIDENT Obama's proposal to cut carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants is reasonable, flexible, and likely to improve the nation's environment and economy. But because of the none-of-the-above approach to nontraditional energy taken by Gov. John Kasich and the General Assembly, Ohio will find it especially - and needlessly - hard to comply with the plan and realize its benefits for the state and its people.
\
The proposal, outlined this week by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, aims to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. Heat-trapping carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas that contributes to human-made climate change. Power plants account for nearly 40 percent of emissions of the gas.
\
Instead of dictating how such cuts must occur, the EPA plan will set emissions targets for states and allow them to determine how to meet these goals. Ohio's task is likely to be tough because it is one of the nation's largest emitters of greenhouse gases among states. It relies on coal to generate two-thirds of its electricity, compared with about 40 percent nationwide.
\
Still, the state will have plenty of options. It can promote renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, and advanced energy, such as nuclear power, fuel cells, and clean coal. It can encourage more-efficient use of energy.
\
It can call on utilities to substitute natural gas for coal to generate electricity. And it can, by itself or with other states, work to limit carbon emissions by creating a ""cap and trade"" network of pollution credits that industries can buy and sell - finally imposing a price for spewing pollutants into the air.
\
But Ohio's government is already ruling out most of these options. Lawmakers have passed, and Governor Kasich has said he will sign, Senate Bill 310, which would make Ohio the first state to repudiate its standards for energy efficiency and alternative energy.
\
The Kasich administration has expressed its distaste for cap and trade, even though Ohio utilities favor the market mechanism. And while greater use of natural gas will provide a market for gas fracked from Ohio's shales, that is a transitional stage in ending our state's overreliance on coal, not the final outcome.
\
The usual critics, in Ohio and elsewhere, are accusing the President of waging a ""war on coal,"" and claiming that his carbon proposal will cost jobs and increase consumers' electric bills. But environmental groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council offer credible analyses that conclude just the opposite - that job losses caused if coal-fired power plants closed would be more than offset in Ohio by job gains in renewable-energy and energy-conservation industries. The NRDC study also argues sensibly that a greater emphasis on conservation will cut electric bills.
\
There will be other benefits: Cleaner air means better public health, with fewer work and school days lost to illness. Not least, the United States - now the world's second-largest emitter of carbon - will have greater credibility when it calls on nations such as China and India to reduce their emissions.
\
Mr. Obama's plan faces inevitable political obstruction by Congress, which rejected his previous sensible proposal for a carbon tax. The proposal also is sure to be subjected to legal challenges.
\
The President will be out of office by the time the carbon rule takes full effect, if it ever does. But that is no excuse for doing nothing now to work to limit the potentially catastrophic effects of global climate change.
\
More immediately, Governor Kasich still has time to veto SB 310, making clear to Ohioans whose votes he seeks in his re-election campaign this year that he places their interests ahead of those of fossil-fuel industries and change-averse utilities. If the governor has presidential aspirations in 2016, a veto also would demonstrate his capacity for national leadership. His signature on the bill will show the opposite.

Achieving meaningful reductions in greenhouse gases that cause global warming could result in higher taxes and electric bills while also driving up costs for everything from food to electronics.
\
By how much?
\
That's one of the great unknowns, though many of the world's top climate scientists believe that failing to act is a foolhardy risk that could irreversibly harm the planet and cost more in the long run.
\
This year's presidential election is historic beyond Barack Obama becoming the first African-American presidential nominee for either major party and Sarah Palin becoming the first Alaskan and the first woman on the Republican ticket.
\
It is the first time both major parties are fielding a presidential candidate who vows to tighten rules on coal-fired power plants specifically to cut back on heat-trapping carbon dioxide and other emissions warming the Earth's climate.
\
John McCain co-authored such legislation with Democrat-turned-Independent U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman in 2007, though - like other proposals - it never made it out of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Mr. Obama and his former rival for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton, were among that bill's co-sponsors.
\
Coal-fired power plants are the biggest source of man-made greenhouse gases that cause global warming, responsible for almost 40 percent of the carbon dioxide that humans generate.
\
Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain both favor a cap-and-trade program over a carbon tax, the latter which is a straight tax on emissions that utilities likely would pass along to consumers.
\
The Edison Electric Institute said it cannot quantify how much a carbon tax would drive up electric bills but said the cost would be ""substantial."" Under a cap-and-trade program, the government would place a limit on emissions and force utilities to barter for credits.
\
Many utility officials prefer the cap-and-trade concept because it is a market-based approach and rewards ingenuity.
\
Utilities that operate efficiently can sell leftover credits to utilities that don't.
\
Such a program has been used nationally since 1990 to cut back on emissions of sulfur dioxide that form acid rain in the atmosphere. Acidic precipitation damages forests, lakes, and streams.
\
While both candidates still are fine-tuning their programs, Mr. Obama said he envisions one aggressive enough to curb greenhouse gases 80 percent by 2050. Mr. McCain said he is looking at one that achieves a 60 percent reduction by that same year.
\
Just last week, U.S. Reps. John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Rick Boucher (D., Va.) released a discussion draft of legislation that aims to reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2050 through a cap-and-trade program.
\
U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.), who chairs the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, called it ""a very good sign of the commitment in the House to tackle global warming legislation in the next Congress.""
\
Politics and money
\
If the science behind climate change is such a slam dunk, why aren't more people embracing it?
\
Two words: politics and money.
\
According to the Pew Research Center, only 27 percent of Republicans believe man has influenced the Earth's climate. Among Democrats, the figure is 58 percent. Independents are split 50-50.
\
""The science is bullet-proof right now. The uncertainty is in the predictions [of climate change],"" said Jason Box, of Ohio State University's Byrd Polar Research Center.
\
Global warming was the sixth biggest story of 2007, according to an Associated Press poll of U.S. editors and news directors.
\
But from conservative talk-show hosts to oil lobbyists, enough doubts have been raised about it to make people uneasy about calls for costly regulations.
\
Some compare it to the disinformation campaign that tobacco lobbyists waged on the public for years. We don't call them skeptics, because any good scientist is a skeptic. We call them 'confusionists.' They're trying to confuse the public like the tobacco lobby did,"" said Don Wuebbles, a University of Illinois atmospheric sciences professor.
\
""The science debate is over,"" he said. ""There is no debate.""
\
'Fog of doubt'
\
Don't say that to the Chicago-based Heartland Institute, publishers of the tabloid-format Environment & Climate News, which claims on its banner to be ""The Monthly Newspaper for Common Sense Environmentalists.""
\
Each issue is chock full of stories about those who debunk climate change as a myth, as well as those who challenge the wisdom of wind, solar, and other forms of renewable energy.
\
The lead story in its December issue last year was one about the controversy over whether former Vice President Al Gore's movie, An Inconvenient Truth, was too partisan to be shown in England's secondary schools.
\
A British High Court ruled the film was a ""powerful, dramatically presented, and highly professionally produced film,"" yet agreed with the father of a child who had challenged that it is a ""political film."" The court allowed schools to show the movie but agreed with the parent there should at least be a disclaimer for teachers to explain it in a greater context.
\
Don't say the debate is over to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, either.
\
That institute, which calls itself a free-market think tank, is believed to be the largest of several recipients of ExxonMobil money to downplay or deny the global warming issue.
\
ExxonMobil announced in 2006 that it had stopped funding such groups, but the Washington Post reported last year that the giant oil company had funneled about $2 million over seven years to that institute alone for its campaign.
\
A cover story in Newsweek last year examined the history of global warming naysayers, claiming that one group funded by ExxonMobil had offered scientists $10,000 to write articles undercutting the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Nobel-winning report in 2007.
\
""Since the late 1980s, this well-coordinated, well-funded campaign by contrarian scientists, free-market think tanks, and industry has created a paralyzing fog of doubt around climate change,"" the article stated.
\
Opposing views
\
Is this effort a disinformation campaign or an effort to bring balance to the debate?
\
Both sides have accused each other of trying to mislead the public with half-truths, exaggerations, and outright lies.
\
Both have their rising stars.
\
This month's edition of Esquire lists Al Gore and Bjorn Lomborg as two of the 21st Century's most influential people, the latest of several such accolades the men have received from major publications.
\
Most people are aware Mr. Gore was a co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for warnings about climate change that began while he was still in Congress and culminated with his Oscar-winning documentary, An Inconvenient Truth.
\
The public at large is not as familiar with Mr. Lomborg. But the Danish political scientist and business professor has become a hero to legions of people who believe global warming has been blown out of proportion, if it exists at all.
\
He has been wildly popular among naysayers for books such as The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World (originally published in Demark in 1998 and translated into English in 2001) and last year's Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Climate Change.
\
His first book, though - the one that brought him celebrity - was lambasted first in the scientific journal, Nature, and then in a 2002 Scientific American article by four experts who claimed it was fraught with errors, intentional oversights, and misleading statements. The controversy didn't stop there: The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty condemned the book in January, 2003. The committees' 27 allegations were dismissed by the Danish government that December.
\
Mr. Lomborg acknowledges that climate change exists but questions the causes of it. He suggests people take a more pragmatic view of what's happening to the Earth, rather than spending billions of dollars searching for a fix that might only have a marginal effect, at best.
\
His biggest fans include bestselling American fiction writer Michael Crichton, who described Mr. Lomborg on amazon.com as ""the best-informed and most humane advocate for environmental change in the world today.""
\
""In contrast to other figures that promote a single issue while ignoring others, Lomborg views the globe as a whole, studies all the problems we face, ranks them, and determines how best, and in what order, we should address them,"" wrote Mr. Crichton, who created a buzz himself with his 2004 thriller, State of Fear, a novel that plays off the global warming debate.
\
Although the book is fiction, many people have cited footnotes in it as proof that global warming is a hoax.
\
Among them is University of Michigan football play-by-play announcer Frank Beckmann, who hosts a conservative talk show on WJR-AM (760) in Detroit and writes a political column for the Detroit News.
\
WJR is an 86-year-old AM radio station with a signal strong enough to be heard throughout much of the Great Lakes region and parts of Canada.
\
Mr. Beckmann has a page on WJR's Web site dedicated to his views about climate change.
\
""I always direct newcomers in the global warming arena to begin by reading Michael Crichton's book, State of Fear, not so much for the story but for all the research included in its pages,"" Mr. Beckmann said in the opening line of that Web page.
\
Mr. Beckmann, a conservative, includes a 1948 quote in which Norman Thomas, a six-time Socialist Party of America candidate, claimed Americans will never knowingly adopt socialism but will inadvertently become a socialist nation under the guise of liberal programs.
\
Acknowledging the issue
\
Though many people continue to question how much human activity is affecting the climate or whether global warming exists at all, a number of public officials beyond Mr. Gore have recognized it as a legitimate issue.
\
""Global climate change is the most important environmental challenge facing not only our nation, but the entire world.""
\
Those were the words Mr. McCain used to begin his June 5 press release in support of the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2008, a bill that resembled legislation he had proposed with Mr. Lieberman last year. The bill made it out of committee but could not pass the full Senate this summer.
\
That same day, two retired military officers, Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan and Adm. T. Joseph Lopez, called global warming a national security threat at a press conference in support of the Lieberman-Warner bill. In addition to Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Warner, the officers were joined by Senator Boxer and Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.).
\
General Sullivan, admitting he was once a skeptic about global warming, cited reduced access to fresh water, impaired food production, land loss, and the displacement of major populations of people as the security issues magnified by climate change. He said the projected changes act ""as a threat multiplier for instability in some of the most volatile regions of the world.""
\
The military never has 100 percent certainty on a battleground - and policymakers shouldn't prolong the debate on climate change, given the risks, he said.
\
""National security involves much more than just military strength. National security is affected by political, military, cultural, and economic elements. And climate change has an impact on each of them,"" Admiral Lopez said. ""The instabilities that exist will create a fertile ground for extremism - and these instabilities are likely to be exacerbated by global climate change.""
\
Both sides of the debate differ over the Bush Administration's treatment of NASA's James Hansen, who has been pushing Congress to address climate change since the 1980s.
\
Mr. Hansen, head of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York and an adjunct professor of Earth and environmental sciences at Columbia University, is the subject of a book released this year, Censoring Science: Inside the Political Attack on Dr. James Hansen and the Truth of Global Warming. In it, author Mark Bowen details how The New York Times and others uncovered evidence of the administration selectively editing his work.
\
But even President Bush, scorned by environmentalists for failing to act on climate change, did something his father never did in the White House.
\
He agreed during his first year in office in 2001 that scientific evidence appeared to link man-made pollution to climate change.
\
Mr. Bush has said for the last seven years he believes governments need to take action but has said he did not want to take measures that would hurt the U.S. economy or fail to be matched by China and India. China last year surpassed the U.S. for total greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Things have come a long way since the 1992 presidential campaign, when Mr. Bush's father, George Herbert Walker Bush, mocked Al Gore on the campaign trail with these words: ""Ozone Man! Ozone! He's crazy, way out, far out, man.""
\
Even in Ohio, there has been a big change since Gov. Ted Strickland became the state's first Democratic governor in years.
\
Environmentalists accused former state Environmental Protection Agency directors Don Schregardus, Chris Jones, and Joe Koncelik of being soft on utilities. Current state EPA Director Chris Korleski said in Ottawa County last spring that uniform, federal rules need to be adopted for cracking down on greenhouse gases to address ""what is truly becoming the environmental issue of our time.""
\
High costs
\
The verdict is far from being unanimous among world leaders.
\
Vaclav Klaus, president of the Czech Republic, told the United Nations on Sept. 24, 2007, that it is premature to call climate change a crisis. He questioned if any government action to curb greenhouse gases is necessary, given the costs and the uncertainty of the payback.
\
On a DVD of his speech that has been widely circulated by the Heartland Institute, Mr. Klaus said developed countries such as the United States do not have the right to tell developing countries such as China and India they should not follow the same path toward modernization.
\
He said the consequences of acknowledging the symptoms of climate change ""as a real, big, imminent, and man-made threat would be so enormous that we are obliged to think twice before making decisions.""
\
""To prematurely declare the victory of one group over another would be a tragic mistake and I'm afraid we are making it,"" Mr. Klaus said.
\
High stakes
\
Those frustrated by the public's mule-like response to the issue include Lonnie Thompson and his wife, Ellen Mosley-Thompson, who 32 years ago co-founded the internationally famous ice core paleoclimatology unit at Ohio State University's Byrd Polar Research Center.
\
Both have traveled the world pulling ice core samples from glaciers and ice sheets in search of clues that will help advance the world's understanding of climate change.
\
Mr. Thompson, featured in Mr. Gore's book and movie, agreed with the comparisons between naysayers and tobacco lobbyists.
\
""The thing about science is it's about what is, not what we hope for,"" he said.
\
Ms. Mosley-Thompson said she is dumbfounded by what she sees as a movement to deceive the public.
\
""It's very frustrating. It's very demoralizing. It's amazing how many intelligent, very skilled people believe the rubbish, and I mean the rubbish that the Heartland Institute and Fox News puts out,"" she said.
\
The message is complicated by sound bites and short-range vision, according to Konrad ""Koni"" Steffen, a University of Colorado researcher who has been doing research in the Arctic since 1975 and has been on the Greenland ice sheet annually since 1990.
\
Earth's climate would be different in 2100, even if mankind wasn't generating so much carbon dioxide.
\
""This is the difficult part to talk about with politicians: We're in for warming no matter what we do. But life doesn't stop at 2100,"" he said.
\
Mr. Box wonders if climate change gets a cool reaction from a segment of the population because of a politically driven callousness that some people have about nature, naively and arrogantly thinking the human race is above it.
\
""There's obviously a strong political resistance to environmental destruction. I mean, it goes beyond climate warming. We're chopping down the forests, we're killing the oceans, we're killing the air. Raising the temperature of the climate is just one other way that humans are managing to destroy the environment,"" he said. ""I think [to some people] it's just another 'Save the Whales.' ""
\
Except that the stakes are global if we're wrong.
\
""Humans have really gotta get their act together if they want to take this one on,"" Mr. Box said.
\

"
24,"Back to the future. \Duke Energy announced this week that it wants to build a nuclear power plant in Piketon, about 100 miles east of Cincinnati, due south of Columbus. \Duke provides electricity to most of Warren and Butler counties, as well as the Cincinnati area (and tiny parts of Montgomery and Preble counties). \The company is confronting the fact that its Ohio business is now coal-based. And coal is a problem. \Washington seems to be moving toward some sort of limit on the carbon emissions that are associated with coal. (Some legislative proposals would hit Ohio particularly hard.) \Whether the much-talkedabout ""cap and trade"" legislation passes or not, the coal industry seems likely to be on the defensive for a while, given the ties that science sees between carbon dioxide and global warming. \The utility apparently doesn't see the new-fangled likes of solar, wind or geothermal energy as quite ready to meet its needs. So it's returning to a technology that it sees as relatively tried and true. It operates other nuclear reactors out of state. \The last time Ohio turned to the nuclear option, things didn't work out. Three utilities, including Dayton Power & Light, started work on a nuclear plant known as the Zimmer project -- also east of Cincinnati -- in the early 1970s. \After much went wrong, and after $1.7 billion was spent, they gave up, turning the plant into a coal-fired one, and spending another $2 billion to do it. \So the fact that Duke says it wants a plant now doesn't mean a plant will happen, notwithstanding the enthusiastic support of the likes of Gov. Ted Strickland and Sen. George Voinovich. This is the beginning of a long, long effort. \The people around Piketon are more familiar than most with the dangers of a badly run nuclear operation. The Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant, a Cold War project, resulted in several thousand workers and their survivors collecting hundreds of millions of federal dollars in this decade for resulting medical problems. The contamination is still being cleaned up, with stimulus money. \Even today, nuclear reactors come with a lot of problems. They are enormously expensive. They take forever to come on line, in part because every plant is different; there's no kit. Also, the country is still fighting about what to do with waste that nuclear reactors generate. And what to do with nuclear plants when their lives are over is still an issue. \Still, the fact is that nuclear energy has undergone a sort of rebirth in popularity since its earlier problems, including the famous Three Mile Island incident. A partial core meltdown at that nuclear plant in Pennsylvania scared the nation. That happened as the Zimmer plant was being built. \Nuclear technology -- and the attendant safety precautions -- have come a long way. And nuclear plants have operated a long time without any huge human catastrophe, at least in the West. France has 59 nuclear plants providing most of its electrical power, with excess to export. \Meanwhile, every other kind of power generation turns out to have its problems. These days, any kind of mass energy source that doesn't necessarily hurt the environment and doesn't come from the Mideast has a lot of attraction. \Ohio -- especially Appalachian southern Ohio -- has to be somewhat happy about any major corporation wanting to build just about any major project these days. Officials are saying that construction alone could provide 4,000 jobs. \But any nuclear project does still have to be kept under a powerful microscope. Nuclear is very far from problem-free. It just poses a different set of problems."

\
Jim Rogers supported Barack Obama for president, but now the Duke Energy Corp. chairman and CEO finds himself at odds with the president's first big environmental initiative.
\
Overall, Rogers agrees that a ""cap-and-trade"" system is the best way to reduce greenhouse gases, believed to be a major contributor to global warming. But unless details change, Duke customers in Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky could end up paying electric utility rates 25 percent to 30 percent higher than today, Rogers says.
\
Obama aides don't dispute that consumers will get the passed-along costs. But they aren't sure precisely what the costs will be, although they say Obama's tax cuts would mitigate some increase for low- and middle-income families.
\
""If people don't change how they use energy, then they will face higher costs for energy,"" Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said last week.
\
Obama's cap-and-trade system would set declining caps, or limits, on new carbon emissions by major coal-burning utilities such as Duke. Companies that can't meet the caps could buy permits, or carbon credits, from other companies that have reduced their emissions of the heat-trapping gases.
\
The goal is to create an economic incentive for cleaner technology nationwide.
\
Rogers agrees with the overall approach, ""but we want a smooth transition to a low-carbon world,"" he says.
\
""We can't do it by punishing those who rely on coal.""
\
The move to a cap-and-trade system is expected to accelerate the push for clean and renewable energy alternatives.
\
It's not just theory. Environmental and utility advocates say a similar approach was hugely successful in reducing acid rain emissions under the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments.
\
The acid-rain program achieved nearly total compliance, cost 50 percent less than expected and improved air quality more than 25 percent more than projected, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says.
\
Duke Energy, the nation's third-largest electric utility and third-largest carbon emitter, says it will have spent $5 billion by next year on scrubbers at its coal-fired generating plants under the acid-rain program and reduced its emissions by 70 percent.
\
The administration's cap-and-trade proposal calls for auctioning 100 percent of the carbon credits, a move that's projected to generate $645.7 billion for the government from 2012 to 2019. About $120 billion of that money would be used to develop low-carbon technologies.
\
The rest would be returned ""to the people, especially vulnerable families, communities and businesses to help the transition to a clean energy economy,"" Obama's proposal says.
\
Analysts say the money would be used to make permanent Obama's Making Work Pay tax credit, which will provide up to $400 for certain working individuals and $800 for working families starting April 1.
\
Last week, White House budget chief Peter Orszag told the House Ways and Means Committee that he could not provide a specific cost to consumers under Obama's plan.
\
Congressional Budget Office projections last year - based on 1998 pollution levels - estimated that a 15 percent reduction in emissions by 2018 would increase costs to low- and moderate-income families by about 3 percent of their total income.
\
Rogers' approach
\
Rogers says a better approach would be to allocate the credits to companies such as Duke, to offset their investments in clean energy alternatives. That's the approach used in the acid rain program. Otherwise, he argues, utility customers will end up paying twice: once to acquire the credits to stay under the cap and again for investments in new technology.
\
Besides higher rates, Rogers says, Obama's approach would mean:
\
A net transfer of wealth from the heavy coal-burning Midwest and South to the East and West coasts, where coal isn't a significant power generator, because most of the revenues would flow directly to taxpayers.
\
Less money would be devoted to finding a solution to global warming. ""If we're going to auction off the permits, all of the money ought to go back into improving energy efficiency,"" he says.
\
Groups fire back
\
Not everyone appreciates Rogers' approach.
\
""Unfortunately, Mr. Rogers' comments aren't helpful,"" says Joe Mendelson, director of global warming policy for the National Wildlife Federation.
\
Critics argue an allocation system would be an economic windfall for polluters. Rogers counters that state utility commissions regulate the rate-setting process, and he'd be willing to sign a pledge that revenue from the credits wouldn't be used to benefit shareholders.
\
""The devil is always in the details,"" says Tom Bullock, Ohio representative of the Pew Environment Group, part of the Pew Charitable Trust.
\
""An auction system has proven to be fairer to taxpayers and the least likely to result in windfall profits,"" he says. Using an auction to allocate the credits also doesn't preclude directing the revenues to those most affected, he says.
\
Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio was one of 10 Senate Democrats who signed an influential letter last year urging that any climate change legislation treat those affected equitably. Brown says he supports the cap-and-trade approach, but revenues should go ""back to the consumers, states and industries that are most affected.""
\
Rogers, who led the former Cinergy Corp.'s merger with Duke in 2006, says he spent about six hours over the course of the fall election trying to convert Obama to his point of view.
\
""I told him people in this part of the country would be hurt,"" Rogers says. ""I wasn't shocked he didn't change his position. I guess I wasn't a very good salesman.""
\
Republican candidate Sen. John McCain also supported cap and trade during the campaign. But he didn't take a position on auctioning and it never became a major campaign issue.
\
Legislation in pipeline
\
In his budget message last month, Obama set goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 14 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and 83 percent below 2005 levels by 2050.
\
Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, expects to have a cap-and-trade bill ready by June. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has promised a vote on comprehensive energy and environmental legislation in August.
\
There's a sense in Washington that Obama wants action on U.S. greenhouse gas emissions this year in time for new international negotiations on global warming slated for December in Copenhagen.

'Cap and trade' would limit emissions, but at a cost
\
By Mike Boyer / mboyer@enquirer.com
\
Among all the issues facing the United States, climate change could be the most important in the long run. It is driving a major debate in Washington over a complex proposal, called ""cap and trade,"" designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
\
If passed by Congress, the plan would change the way companies do business, and would affect the finances and lifestyles of Americans for decades to come.
\
The legislation, sought by President Obama, would cap emissions of carbon dioxide and six other greenhouse gases believed to be a major source of global warming. It also lays out steps to transform the U.S. economy by increasing energy efficiency, using more renewable fuels and developing new technology while lessening reliance on foreign energy sources.
\
Depending on your point of view, the climate change legislation will:
\
Destroy thousands of U.S. jobs as manufacturing moves overseas, or create thousands of ""green"" jobs and restore U.S. competitiveness.
\
Cost consumers hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars annually or cost the average consumer about the price of a postage stamp a day.
\
Combat global warming pollution, or result in more global warming pollution.
\
There's a lot at stake for local businesses and consumers.
\
Because the Cincinnati area relies heavily on coal-fired electricity and has little mass transit, the average resident emitted 3.281 tons of carbon in 2005, third-highest among the nation's 100 largest metropolitan areas, according to a year-old Brookings Institution study. The region's footprint per person increased 12 percent from 2000 to 2005, according to the study.
\
Advocates say climate-change legislation is ultimately more fundamental than reform of health care, the issue dominating recent headlines.
\
""Not to demean the health-care debate, but if our planet isn't habitable it won't make a lot of difference what type of health-care system we have,"" said Joe Mendelson, director of global warming policy for the Washington, D.C.-based National Wildlife Federation. Slowing global warming could have a big impact on limiting the spread of disease and illness and the cost of health care, he said.
\
The House took the first big step toward a cap and trade law June 26, approving 219-212 the massive American Clean Energy and Security Act, capping carbon emissions by major emitters such as refineries, electric and gas suppliers and major industries such as steel and chemicals at 2005 levels starting in 2012. It aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent by 2020 and more than 80 percent by 2050.
\
To ease the transition, the 1,400-page bill creates a complex system of allowances, or permits, for carbon emissions to help the industries meet the cap as they move to carbon-free fuels. The allowances, which can be bought and sold, are designed as a market mechanism to spur the development of new and alternative energy sources such as wind, solar, nuclear and still-developing carbon-capture technology.
\
Rep. Steve Driehaus, D-Price Hill, who has defended his vote for the bill in the face of heavy GOP attacks, argues that carbon caps are inevitable in the wake of a Supreme Court decision giving the EPA authority to regulate greenhouse gases. He argues it's better for Congress to set the rules rather than leave it to regulators. And he points to new-energy-development provisions in the bill, which a recent study suggested could create more than 80,000 jobs in Ohio.
\
The debate is now moving to the Senate, where the Environment and Public Works Committee, chaired by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., is expected to report its initial language after Labor Day. The full Senate could take up the debate by October.
\
Estimates of the cost to consumers vary widely, but an EPA analysis calculated the cost on the order of $80 to $111 per U.S. household annually. Critics charge the EPA's figures are based on assumptions that are unrealistic or faulty.
\
The House legislation includes language designed to shield ratepayers from major rate increases by requiring emission credits be passed through for ""the benefit of ratepayers."" Last week more than two dozen environmental and consumer groups, including AARP and Ohio Citizen Action, urged the Senate to include a better definition of what that means as well as other consumer protections.
\
Duke Energy Corp., which uses coal to generate about 90 percent of its electricity in the Midwest, says electric rates will rise regardless of climate-change legislation because of higher fuel prices and the need to replace its aging generating plants.
\
The company, which has been active in attempting to craft climate legislation, says factoring in the carbon caps and allowances in the House legislation could mean a 10 percent increase in future electric rates.
\
Some area businesses are skeptical.
\
""I've seen some estimates that our electric rates could increase 56 percent by 2030 when the allowances expire,"" said Ross Bushman, president and chief operating officer of Cast-Fab Technologies, an Oakley metal foundry. Cast-Fab, which employs about 330, operates all-electric furnaces. Dramatically higher electric rates could decimate the U.S. metal-casting industry, he said. ""Cap and trade could drive more production off-shore.""
\
The irony is that a big part of Cast-Fab's business has been producing huge metal housings for utility-scale wind turbines, one of the renewable energy sources climate-change advocates are counting on as carbon-based fuels become too expensive.
\
Likewise, Tom Shepherd, chairman and CEO of Shepherd Chemical Co. in Norwood and Shepherd Color Co. in West Chester, says he has ""strong concerns"" about the cap and trade provisions.
\
The family-run companies, which employ about 300 here, produce pigments and specialty chemicals used in a variety of products from automobiles to plastic bags. Shepherd estimates the cost of carbon allowances and higher natural gas rates expected as a result could increase his energy costs by $1 million to $3 million a year.
\
""The problem is that markets for carbon allowances and natural gas aren't global markets,"" he said. ""While our costs increase, there isn't the same pressure on our competitors in India and China.""
\
The Obama administration hopes adopting carbon caps will give the U.S. leverage and leadership when foreign governments meet in December to iron out global limits on carbon emissions, but some manufacturers are skeptical.
\
Developing steelmakers in countries such as Brazil, Russia, India and China ""aren't likely to go along"" with carbon limits, said Alan McCoy, vice president for governmental affairs at West Chester-based AK Steel. ""Without adjustments (on carbon emissions) outside our borders, U.S. steelmakers will be at a huge disadvantage.""
\
As more production of steel, chemicals and other commodities moves to regions without carbon caps, global production of greenhouse gases could actually increase, McCoy said.
\
John Stowell, vice president of environmental health and safety policy at Duke Energy in Cincinnati, said that some of the most important parts of the House bill are provisions allowing companies to invest in carbon offsets, doing things such as planting trees and capturing methane gases.
\
""How offsets are treated, counted and verified is a real wild card,"" he said. Offsets are likely to get increased attention as the legislation moves forward in the Senate.
\
Shepherd said ""U.S. manufacturing is the most innovative in the world. We're not going to stand still and get beaten.""
\
Climate change advocates are counting on U.S. innovation to figure out how to prosper in a carbon-constrained world.
\
""They might be right,"" he said. ""But it will be a real disaster if the pace of greenhouse gas reductions is faster than industry's ability to reduce them.""
\
HOW IT WORKS
\
The U.S. Senate is beginning to debate the American Clean Energy and Security
\
Act, a climate change bill that passed the House on June 26 by a 219-212 vote. The bill aims at giving power plants and factories a financial incentive to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
\
1. A limit, or cap, is set on emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases produced in the U.S.
\
2. Companies receive permits (85 percent provided free, 15 percent by auction) allowing them to emit a limited amount of these gases. The limits get smaller until the U.S. reduces total emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, and by about 80 percent by 2050.
\
3. Companies can buy, sell, bank and trade emission credits. A company that increases energy efficiency or converts to cleaner technology would gain extra credits that it could sell.

WHAT'S AT STAKE
\
Advocates of cap and trade legislation argue it is the most rational approach to curbing greenhouse gases, from both environmental and economic standpoints. Also, they say that having it in place will give the U.S. leverage in talks later this year to persuade high-polluting nations such as China and India to adopt emission-reduction laws.
\
Opponents argue it will kill manufacturing jobs in states such as Ohio, enrich companies that get carbon credits, drive up the price of energy and goods for consumers, and fail to control emissions anyway.Columnist George Will on the global politics behind cap and trade. F3

Likewise, Tom Shepherd, chairman and CEO of Shepherd Chemical Co. in Norwood and Shepherd Color Co. in West Chester, says he has ""strong concerns"" about the cap and trade provisions.
\
The family-run companies, which employ about 300 here, produce pigments and specialty chemicals used in a variety of products from automobiles to plastic bags. Shepherd estimates the cost of carbon allowances and higher natural gas rates expected as a result could increase his energy costs by $1 million to $3 million a year.
\
""The problem is that markets for carbon allowances and natural gas aren't global markets,"" he said. ""While our costs increase, there isn't the same pressure on our competitors in India and China.""
\
The Obama administration hopes adopting carbon caps will give the U.S. leverage and leadership when foreign governments meet in December to iron out global limits on carbon emissions, but some manufacturers are skeptical.
\
Developing steelmakers in countries such as Brazil, Russia, India and China ""aren't likely to go along"" with carbon limits, said Alan McCoy, vice president for governmental affairs at West Chester-based AK Steel. ""Without adjustments (on carbon emissions) outside our borders, U.S. steelmakers will be at a huge disadvantage.""
\
As more production of steel, chemicals and other commodities moves to regions without carbon caps, global production of greenhouse gases could actually increase, McCoy said.
\
John Stowell, vice president of environmental health and safety policy at Duke Energy in Cincinnati, said that some of the most important parts of the House bill are provisions allowing companies to invest in carbon offsets, doing things such as planting trees and capturing methane gases.
\
""How offsets are treated, counted and verified is a real wild card,"" he said. Offsets are likely to get increased attention as the legislation moves forward in the Senate.
\
Shepherd said ""U.S. manufacturing is the most innovative in the world. We're not going to stand still and get beaten.""
\
Climate change advocates are counting on U.S. innovation to figure out how to prosper in a carbon-constrained world.
\
""They might be right,"" he said. ""But it will be a real disaster if the pace of greenhouse gas reductions is faster than industry's ability to reduce them.""
\
HOW IT WORKS
\
The U.S. Senate is beginning to debate the American Clean Energy and Security
\
Act, a climate change bill that passed the House on June 26 by a 219-212 vote. The bill aims at giving power plants and factories a financial incentive to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
\
1. A limit, or cap, is set on emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases produced in the U.S.
\
2. Companies receive permits (85 percent provided free, 15 percent by auction) allowing them to emit a limited amount of these gases. The limits get smaller until the U.S. reduces total emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, and by about 80 percent by 2050.
\
3. Companies can buy, sell, bank and trade emission credits. A company that increases energy efficiency or converts to cleaner technology would gain extra credits that it could sell.

WHAT'S AT STAKE
\
Advocates of cap and trade legislation argue it is the most rational approach to curbing greenhouse gases, from both environmental and economic standpoints. Also, they say that having it in place will give the U.S. leverage in talks later this year to persuade high-polluting nations such as China and India to adopt emission-reduction laws.
\
Opponents argue it will kill manufacturing jobs in states such as Ohio, enrich companies that get carbon credits, drive up the price of energy and goods for consumers, and fail to control emissions anyway.Columnist George Will on the global politics behind cap and trade. F3

"
28,"Recently, I've heard from many constituents expressing their frustration about the news that American Electric Power would close five power plants, lose 6,000 megawatts of capacity and eliminate 600 positions to comply with proposed Environmental Protection Agency rules to further limit emissions and toxic chemicals released by power plants.\AEP's announcement comes as sobering news during a time when Ohio's economy is struggling to restart. In fact, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity estimates EPA's proposals would result in 53,000 Ohio job losses during the next decade, increase electric bills by 13 percent, putting Ohioans out of work, increasing home energy prices and driving up the cost of doing business. For a state that's lost almost 350,000 manufacturing jobs during the past decade, these rule changes could continue to hurt the economy.\AEP's announcement is a symbol of what's going on across all sectors. Since 2009, the Obama administration has worked to implement scores of new regulations produced by EPA and other federal agencies. Most Americans think commonsense regulations can play a legitimate role in government. For instance, the Federal Aviation Administration's regulations that set minimum distances between airplanes while in the air help to prevent collisions. However, it has been a different story during the past two and a half years. AEP argues it is EPA's unrealistic timeframe for implementing the regulations that will lead to the premature job losses.\The proposed regulations cover all sorts of areas, some you probably have heard of, some of you might not -- and some of which a first appear rather harmless. For example, the EPA's new regulations on greenhouse gas emissions only come after Congress refused to pass cap-and-trade legislation supported by the Obama administration. During the cap-and-trade debate, the administration threatened to unilaterally regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act in an attempt to force legislators to support cap-and-trade legislation in lieu of much worse EPA regulations. Despite the broad range of views on cap-and-trade legislation, many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle agreed that it is Congress's role to enact such regulations because of the major impacts they could have on the economy. Shockingly, the EPA has not performed an analysis of the economic impacts of the greenhouse gas regulations. However, one private sector analysis concluded that just the uncertainty alone created by the regulations could cost $25 billion to $75 billion in lost capital investment and between 500,000 to 1.5 million jobs by 2014.\What has been alarming during the past two and a half years is the mixture of regulations so overarching they affect large sectors of the economy combined with the large number of controversial regulations often made unilaterally by unelected bureaucrats. Unfortunately, the new, restrictive rules aren't unique to the EPA; regulations are being implemented by federal agencies across all sectors with little thought of their impact. For example, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson accused businesses of describing ""doomsday"" scenarios when describing the impact of the proposed rules. However, AEP has described tangible effects that will have a massive impact on Ohio's economy because 84 percent of Ohio's electricity comes from coal. A study commissioned by the Small Business Administration found that annual regulatory compliance costs in the United States hit $1.75 trillion in 2008, which exceeds the total amount of income taxes, $1.49 trillion, collected that year.\The president argues that in order to move our economy forward, large companies should be spending their money hiring workers and creating jobs. Companies argue the uncertainty created by proposed regulations, tax changes and federal budget issues make it difficult to anticipate future needs and leave them unable to prepare for the future.\This is something we in Congress hear again and again. Since Republicans have gained the majority, we've been holding hearings about job creation and listening to employers talk about the environment they need to grow, expand and hire. I've cosponsored a bill written by Congressman Geoff Davis: the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, or the REINS Act. The bill would prevent unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats from adopting major rules without consultation with the legislative branch. Specifically, the bill would require Congress to take an up-or-down, stand-alone vote and for the president to sign-off on all new major rules before they can be enforced on the American people, job-creating small businesses or state and local governments. Major rules are those that have an annual economic impact of more than $100 million or more. IN 2010, 100 major rules were finalized by the administration.\The REINS Act would improve the regulatory process and encourage agencies and Congress to work together to create regulations that implement the original intent of the law. In addition, this would prevent the administration, regardless of party, from bypassing Congress to implement regulations that further their political agenda. Members of Congress then could be held accountable for the results of the legislation they pass.\The constitutional responsibility of Congress to make the laws would be strengthened by no longer permitting unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats to make major decisions. Creating a sense of stability for employers will help create an environment where businesses can grow, expand, and hire, will help Ohio's economy get back on track.\Congressman Tiberi proudly represents the 12th District of Ohio, composed of Delaware County and portions of Franklin and Licking counties in central Ohio. Congressman Tiberi serves as the Chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures.\ID_Code: BF-107120315"

\
""All you need to know about illegal immigration is just that - it is illegal,"" he said in his campaign ""A country that fails to control its borders ceases to exist. Clearly, the government has to stop playing politics with this issue and get to work to fix it.""

\
On immigration reform she said in her campaign statements: ""Millions of uprooted immigrants risk their lives crossing the U.S.-Mexico border region, in search of the American Dream. Millions of U.S. citizens find their standard of living dropping as living wage jobs with benefits are outsourced to Mexico and other nations where half the population exists on $4 per day,"" she said ""Only when these flawed trade deals are renegotiated will the root causes of America' simmigration problemberesolved.""

Levy will help keep 'excellent'
\
Editor:
\
Sometimes people say, ""School just isn't like the good old days.""
\
For Southeast Local that is true ... because our schools have been getting better! Southeast Schools proudly earned another Excellent rating from the state this past year. The elementary buildings have been honored multiple times with Blue Ribbon or School of Promise awards, which recognize their accomplishments in educating students.
\
Southeast Local is facing one of the biggest changes in the district since its consolidation. Closing three of the six buildings will drastically alter the makeup of Golden Bear Territory. Make no mistake, every corner of the district will feel the change. Holmesville Elementary students may well be the ones to notice longer bus rides, Fredericksburg students will forfeit education enrichment found in the Bear Den Land Lab, Mount Eaton students will be forced to leave behind newly constructed playground equipment. Yes, Apple Creek Elementary, John R Lea and Waynedale High School will remain open for students, but these buildings will literally be overflowing.
\
Student-teacher ratio works best between 12:1 and 25:1. Currently in our district it ranges from 16:1 to 33:1. Our well trained teachers (Southeast has them!) have worked hard to make these circumstances work. However, large student numbers always (yes, always!) creates an environment that makes learning more difficult.
\
At some point even the best teachers have to succumb to ""overload."" If the levy doesn't pass, S.E. Local will be forced to put 1,700 students into classrooms built to accommodate far fewer! With a ratio of 40:1 or maybe even 45:1 teachers will have no choice but to spend less instruction time with individual students and eliminate many enrichment activities or special learning experiences due to the logistics of cramped space and time.
\
These are the things that make a world of difference in the learning process! These are things we can control with a yes vote on the levy! Without individual attention and supplemental learning opportunities students will surely experience diminished learning and the schools will suffer lower scores. Lower school performance will then transfer to lower property values.
\
Please don't set up our kids and our community for failure ... let's set the stage for a future of more ""Excellent days""! VOTE YES for Southeast Local Schools.

Help after tornado appreciated
\
Editor:
\
We, the neighborhood of Tuckahoe Road, would like to express our most heartfelt thanks to those who offered help after the Sept. 16 tornado. Thank you to Mike ""Pineapple"" Raymond for getting our street opened as quickly as you did and for your vigilant watch over the neighborhood throughout the worst of the ordeal.
\
AEP had us up and running in a short time; CPI was on the scene with pizzas for everyone and reconnected service came within 72 hours. The Red Cross was here passing out dinners and water to anyone in need, as well as offering words of encouragement.
\
We cannot begin to count the number of individuals who came to offer their muscles and equipment to get debris removed. Many of these kind folks were friends of friends who just jumped in to do what had to be done.
\
Thanks to the saddle clubs, the 4-H clubs, church groups, friends and family. The State Highway Patrol did a super job of trying to keep the roads clear of unnecessary traffic until it was safe to travel these roads. Thanks to the utility workers from other areas who were on site helping to get our services operating.
\
There are no words to properly express our appreciation, but we want you to know your deeds, thoughts and prayers have been what has kept us going. Many, many thanks.

Boccieri cares for district
\
Editor:
\
It is so ridiculous to hear and worse to read that the same people who are fundraising are so alarmed because some companies have donated to a campaign! Give us a break.
\
Tell me, where did Renacci get his millions before and after his candidacy? From nursing homes? To make it clearer: from senior citizens' money? You are right. Just go to Wadsworth and you will acquire all the information needed.
\
For those who haven't seen or heard Congressman Boccieri -- either never read the newspapers, are in denial or obviously are at the other side of the aisle.
\
Let's compare with facts: This is what Renacci supports:
\
1. Repeal legislation that closed the Medicare Prescription Drug Doughnut Hole for struggling seniors.
\
2. Renacci is endorsed by a group that wants to strip away Social Security and Medicare benefits.
\
3. He doesn't mind slapping on a 23 percent sales tax to prescription drugs while not paying his own taxes.
\
4. Renacci's big corporate special interest friends are running ads and sending mail to scare you. But, nobody knows that the group that's running these adds has fought for many years to turn your Social Security over to Wall Street.
\
This is what Congressman Boccieri is supporting and offering:
\
1. Congressman Boccieri opposes efforts in Congress to privatize Social Security.
\
2. He's working very hard to turn Medicare into a voucher system.
\
3. Congressman Boccieri voted to close the Medicare prescription drug doughnut hole.
\
4. Congressman Boccieri voted to give an extra $250 this year to pay for prescription drugs.
\
5. Congressman Boccieri voted for the largest middle-class tax cut in U.S. history (the Stimulus Package).
\
6. Congressman Boccieri supports legislation that brings new clean energy jobs to our district. This piece of legislation is called, The American Clean Energy and Security Act.
\
It is up to us 16th District constituents to decide if we want the continuation of the outstanding job Congressman Boccieri is doing, or to have somebody that takes advantage of having the last word only to use it for name calling. There is no doubt that the citizens that care for our district will vote for Congressman John Boccieri.

Income inequality a concern
\
Editor:
\
Societies have found various ways to maintain inequality between those who have and those who do not. Castle walls, god kings and slave ownership are some of the many techniques that have been used.
\
In the U.S. today, we have laws and regulations and the myth called the American dream. We are taught to believe that, if we play by the rules, we all have equal opportunity to become a billionaire or at the very least own a big house. Unfortunately, that dream is looking more and more like a nightmare.
\
We recently learned that the spread between rich and poor in the U.S. has reached its highest peak since at least 1967. We see evidence of this all around us, from increasing homelessness to the current political unrest.
\
How can we peaceably reverse this trend? This year we have the opportunity to take one small step in that direction. We can repeal tax cuts for those who make over $250,000 in (unsheltered) income. Their tax rate would rise from 34 percent to 39 percent. That 5 percent would not change the lifestyle or business plans of the wealthy, but it could make a big difference for everybody else and for deficit reduction. Many wealthy individuals are actually in favor of this idea -- those who care about people and know that a stable society means a better life for all.
\
I hope that Daily Record readers will rethink this situation before they go to vote on Nov. 2.

Concern for rights, vote Blevins
\
Editor:
\
I am having a hard time understanding the American voters. When is enough going to be enough?
\
Over the past 20-plus years I have watched the federal government systematically dismantle the Constitution, and strip away our rights, one by one. Where is the outrage? Why are our streets not flooded with protests?
\
Let's look at things of the past decade:
\
The Patriot Act violates freedom of speech, the 1st Amendment, searches and seizures without warrants, the 4th, and no public trials, held without bonds, not knowing who accused you, and no right of council, violations of the 6th. The Military Commissions Act strips a citizen's Right of habeas corpus, saying that citizens can be held without formal charges, extract information by coercion and/or torture, in violation of the 4th and 6th Amendments, as well the Geneva Convention.
\
These are just two of the many abuses of the Bush regime and the Republican Party. Now we have the Obamination of Obamacare, which ""forces"" everyone, except our handlers in Washington, to participate in government sanctioned health insurance programs, or face forced tax penalties, enforced by the armed thugs of the IRS. This is forced coercion, at gunpoint! Cap and Trade, or better described as ""Cap and Tax,"" which is still being pushed, is nothing more than a tax on carbon emissions, so to prevent the now known charade of ""Global Warming."" A tax which is imposed on corporations, then passed onto us.
\
Two, plus several more abuses by the Obama regime, and the Democratic Party.
\
So, what we really have is Democrat-Communist socialism, or Republican-Fascist socialism. Either way we have socialism and police state coercion. Where the heck are the constitutional limitations? Where are the massive protests in every capital, city and hamlet in this nation demanding the adherence to, and protection of our sovereign rights and compliance to the constitution?
\
I told Boccieri to his face that his action in Congress was that of a communist, and Renacci, in a debate with Boccieri on Monday, made remarks that he thinks that some aspects of the Obamacare should be kept. He also supports a national sales tax. Hey, Renacci, what do you not understand of Taxed Enough Already, ""TEA""?
\
Well, I'll stick with the underdog, Jeffery Blevins. At least his views are not socialistic, but more constitutional.
\
For GOD and country,

Time for new school for Dalton
\
Editor:
\
I am a graduate of Dalton High School, my father graduated from Dalton High School, my siblings graduated from Dalton High School, my husband graduated from Dalton High School, my children graduated from Dalton High School and I hope that my grandchildren can graduate from Dalton High School. But, it may not happen.
\
I recognize that a building isn't what makes a school good. It is the students and their families, the teachers and the community that really determine if a school is a good school.
\
But, it is time to replace the Dalton Intermediate School. This school was built when my father was a child. Since then there have been few upgrades to the building. The building is lined with asbestos, the fire safety system and the electrical wiring are very old. We would not tolerate this type of unsafe conditions in our homes or anywhere else.
\
At Kidron, there are no facilities for a cafeteria or gymnasium except to use an old vacated building built many years ago. Our grandchildren are required to take four separate bus trips a day to travel to and from their school destination, only a few short miles from their homes.
\
We need to get past the details of where the school is located. Any site in the Dalton Local School District should work. If Dalton doesn't get behind a plan to build a school to meet the safety needs of its children, we should bow our heads in shame.
\
Please vote for the Dalton Local School Levy.

Fisher good choice for senator
\
Editor:
\
Here's why I'm going to vote for Lee Fisher for Senate: He's down-to-earth, sensible and smart. And he's tuned in to the needs of Ohioans, rather than the career-politico scene of Washington, D.C.
\
I first saw him speak over a year ago when he introduced the commencement speaker at my son's college graduation from Oberlin. It was a sunny day, we all had cameras poised to catch our kids crossing the podium, and I sat up and took notice. ""Who is this guy?"" I asked. (At the time, I was from out-of-state.) I was laughing at his jokes -- about himself and his unexpected introduction to some famous faces at a Washington luncheon. I was surprised that a politician in this age of spin and slickness could make fun of himself and the ego displays that are too often part of our politics.
\
I'll vote for him, because we need more politicians in Washington representing us who can laugh at themselves and feel comfortable doing it, and who will keep their egos in check while they attend to our business.

""Evidence (for) man-made climate change is far from conclusive. However, what is conclusive is the damage some of the more extreme proposals intended to address climate change ... will have on our economy.""
\
Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Westwood
\
""Climate change is a strange mix of science, politics, geography and consumption. They all intermesh.""
\
Bill Bissett, president of the
\
Kentucky Coal Association
\
If you believe NASA, 97 percent of climate scientists agree mankind is the cause for earth's changing environment.
\
Yet when you get politicians in the room to talk about climate change, science doesn't seem to enter the equation.
\
What does? Money, geography, party politics and a region's history play a large role in forming a politician's position on whether people harm the environment, political experts say.
\
For most of the country, Democrats are sold on the idea that we're causing the earth's weather to change for the worse; Republicans, on the whole, remain skeptical.
\
In Kentucky's high-profile Senate race, however, it's not so simple.
\
As the gulf widens between Democrats and Republicans nationally on climate change, coal has closed the gap in Kentucky, particularly in the U.S. Senate race between Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell and Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes.
\
Coal has completely obscured the climate-change debate in Kentucky, said Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community at the University of Kentucky.
\
""Here you've got a planetary issue, an issue that could affect the lives of most of the people on the planet in an adverse way, and the people of Kentucky don't hear a thing about it,"" Cross said. ""Both candidates are so wrapped around the coal industry.""
\
President Barack Obama last month before the United Nations Climate Summit called climate change a ""growing and urgent threat"" and asked the world to join the United States in carbon reduction.
\
Meanwhile, back in Northern Kentucky, McConnell has repeatedly deflected climate change questions by saying he's ""not a scientist.""
\
Repeated questions by The Enquirer earlier this month on whether he believed in man-made climate change didn't faze him.
\
""We can debate this forever,"" McConnell said. ""George Will had a column in the last year or so pointing out that, in the '70s, we were concerned the ice age was coming. I'm not a scientist. I'm interested in protecting Kentucky's economy.""
\
The McConnell and Grimes race - the most expensive in the country - in large part revolves around who is a bigger friend to the coal industry.
\
Both Grimes and McConnell have sounded similar on climate change and turned the debate from science to jobs. Grimes has acknowledged climate change is caused by people but doesn't directly answer what should be done about it. Instead, in a statement to The Enquirer, she shifts her focus on her differences with other Democrats and her desire to protect coal jobs from an over-zealous Environmental Protection Agency.
\
""The difference between me and the position of many national Democrats is that I am pro-coal, and will lead to develop a long-term strategy that addresses economic and energy demands, as well as climate concerns,"" Grimes said in a statement to The Enquirer.
\
McConnell seems to be winning the race in the coalfields. The most recent Louisville Courier-Journal Bluegrass Poll showed McConnell leading in Eastern Kentucky and Western Kentucky, and showed 44 percent of registered voters said they trust McConnell to fight effectively for Kentucky's coal interests, while 22 percent said they trust Grimes.
\
Climate issue transcends science, political party
\
In Kentucky, the issue transcends both science and party and boils down to the economy and the state's disdain for Obama.
\
""Climate change is a strange mix of science, politics, geography and consumption,"" said Bill Bissett, president of the Kentucky Coal Association. ""They all intermesh.""
\
The science gets trumped by economics for most people, Cross said. Miners and coal-mine operators, historically opposed to each other, in Kentucky have united against Obama and the EPA, Cross said.
\
Like most Republicans, many in the coal industry focus on the need to protect coal jobs rather than the science of climate change.
\
People in this region understand more about where their electricity comes from, said Michael Duncan, an eastern Kentucky banker and former chairman of the Republican National Committee who now serves as president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity.
\
""My grandparents didn't have electrification on the farm in eastern Tennessee when I was growing up,"" Duncan said. ""I've seen how, with the industrial revolution, society improved, longevity improved. We're a little bit closer to it than those on the coasts.""
\
This fear of job loss has led to Democrats supporting legislation and measures to oppose EPA regulations. Earlier this year Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway joined the lawsuit other states have filed opposing the proposed EPA greenhouse gas regulations.
\
""I hate to say it, but it will probably take some tragedy, a natural disaster of great proportions, to bring people to their senses,"" said Ruth Bamberger, a Ludlow resident and legislative director for Northern Kentucky of the environmental organization Sierra Club.
\
Climate change different outside of Kentucky
\
The difference between Democrats and Republicans on climate change is much more noticeable in other places. In a 2013 national survey by the Pew Research Center, 64 percent of Democrats and 23 percent of Republicans attributed climate change to human activity.
\
A survey by The Enquirer of the Congressional delegation in Kentucky and Ohio also showed a uniform split between Democrats and Republicans on who was convinced of mankind's role in environmental changes.
\
""Climate change is real, and scientists have confirmed that we are playing a role in the gradual warming of the planet, which has serious consequences for our environment and our economy,"" said Rep. John Yarmuth, a Democrat from the liberal-heavy area of Louisville.
\
Republicans who responded all acknowledged climate change, but all remained skeptical on the cause.
\
""Despite claims to the contrary, the evidence concerning man-made climate change is far from conclusive,"" said Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Westwood, in a statement. ""However, what is conclusive is the damage some of the more extreme proposals intended to address climate change, like cap-and-trade, will have on our economy.""
\
Coal, oil and gas
\
have opened their wallets
\
Money plays a role in the different messages, experts say.
\
The entrance of super PACs after the 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court case opened the floodgates, said Heather Taylor-Miesle, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmentalist group.
\
The coal industry spent five times as much on Congressional candidates in 2012 as it did in 2008, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The oil and natural gas industry increased political spending 89 percent during that time.
\
A majority of that money has gone to Republicans. Of the $34 million from oil and natural gas industry given to Congressional candidates this election cycle, 88 percent went to Republican candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. For the $5 million in coal money given to federal campaigns in 2014, 95 percent went to Republicans.
\
""You'll see where someone starts to talk about the issue, and magically there is more campaign dollars in the coffers,"" Miesle said. ""It has a lot to do with money.""
\
Money from alternative energy, though in smaller amounts, has mostly gone to Democrats. In 2012, a total of $2.8 million from the alternative energy lobby was spent on Senate and House candidates, with 58 percent going to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
\
A few key races this year might determine whether money continues to have an influence on the climate change debate.
\
Environmentalists have opposed the Republican incumbents in the Pennsylvania governor's race and Kansas Senate race, said David Donnelly, president of Every Voice, a nonpartisan group that works to reform campaign finance laws. If successful, that could diminish the political clout of fossil fuel interests, Donnelly said.
\
""If the environmental community can show the issue is more important than money to elect and defeat candidates, then it's possible the partisan lines will fracture,"" Donnelly said. ""If the opposite happens, we could see a muting of some of the Democratic message.""

Speaker of the House John Boehner, R-West Chester

\
""Despite claims to the contrary, the evidence concerning man-made climate change is far from conclusive. However, what is conclusive is the damage some of the more extreme proposals intended to address climate change, like cap-and-trade, will have on our economy. Make no mistake, they will cost thousands and thousands of jobs - many right here in Ohio.""
\
Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Lewis County, Ky.
\
""The earth's climate is constantly changing and most of it is due to natural causes. But it would be irresponsible to assume that human activity has zero influence on the environment. So the real question is - how much is the climate changing, and how much of that change is man-made? I have yet to find compelling and unbiased statistics that indicate man-made activity is the main driver of climate change. It is misleading to say that 97 percent of climate scientists agree that climate change is due to human activity, because these same scientists don't agree how much climate change is due to human activity, what types of climate change are due to human activity, or the mechanism through which human activity affects the climate.""
\
Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
\
Chose to respond to the question with a quote by him in The Enquirer in a March article: ""For everybody who thinks it's warming, I can find somebody who thinks it isn't. You're not going to have global cooperation to do it. Even if you conceded the point, which I don't concede, but if you conceded the point, it isn't going to be addressed by one country. So the idea is, we tie our own hands behind our back and others don't. I think it's beyond foolish and real people are being hurt by this.""

Did not respond to question.
\
""(Scientists) are making up their facts to fit their conclusions. They've already caught them doing this."" (Rally for Republicans, Jan. 30, 2010)
\
Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio
\
""I do think overall the Earth is warming. I think the jury's still out on (man's role.)""
\
""I think we ought to hedge against the risk, but I don't think it's fair to say the science is settled on the degree to which human activity causes it.""
\
Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Columbia Tusculum
\
""Scientific debate continues about how much of an impact human activity is having on the climate relative to natural trends. For example, on Sept. 19, the Wall Street Journal published an essay by scientist Steven Koonin about the assessment and predictability of climate change. I do feel the Obama Administration's regulatory approach on climate change would hurt the economy and jobs in Ohio, while other nations like China and India continue to emit carbon unchecked. I believe we have a responsibility to be good stewards of the environment, but I am concerned about hardworking Americans having to pay for speculative environmental promises""

The University of Toledo and Bowling Green State University can play important roles in Ohio's transition to a carbon-neutral world - an industrial transformation that offers jobs if done right and economic calamity if done incorrectly, according to Gov. Ted Strickland's energy adviser.
\
Mark Shanahan, who also has maintained his post as Ohio Air Quality Development Authority executive director while working for Mr. Strickland, told about 100 people at the UT College of Law auditorium yesterday the transition can be smooth or rough. A lot depends on timing and money.
\
Ohio is the nation's No. 4 user of power, and almost 90 percent of its electricity comes from coal-fired power plants.
\
Despite layoffs, the state still employs more than 750,000 in the manufacturing sector - one of the greatest energy consumers - and remains especially strong in glass manufacturing, food processing, and health-care services, Mr. Shanahan said.
\
""The Ohio economy is very carbon-intensive,"" he told attendees of a climate change seminar sponsored by UT's law school.
\
But it would be in Ohio's best interest if the U.S. Senate passes cap-and-trade legislation soon.
\
Many people in industry now believe such legislation will be approved someday.
\
In an interview this week, Peter Molinaro of the Dow Chemical Co. in Midland, Mich., one of the world's largest manufacturers, said major industries are eager to learn how stringent the rules will be for greenhouse-gas releases so they can plan accordingly.
\
Dow is part of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, a consortium of industry, environment, and public interest groups lobbying for climate legislation that is fair, yet effective.
\
""The science is pretty clear it does pose a risk to human health and the environment,"" Mr. Shanahan said of the chief greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide.
\
UT and BGSU are part of the 15-member University Clean Energy Alliance of Ohio, a consortium of state universities founded three years ago for collaborating research in clean energy.
\
The universities are working with NASA, Battelle Memorial Institute, the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, the U.S. Department of Energy, and a number of others in finding ways to do everything from advancing wind power to sequestering carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants.
\
""If we're successful in making the transition, it can be an economic boon for Ohio,"" Mr. Shanahan said. ""It can have enormous potential for us, but there are serious risks.""
\
He said it is unclear how fast the U.S. Senate might move on climate legislation, given how the bitter debate over a national health-care bill has divided the country.
\
The U.S. House has passed climate legislation known as the Waxman-Markey bill. The Senate is expected to eventually consider a similar cap-and-trade proposal.
\
Cap-and-trade programs cap industrial releases at various levels, but allow companies to buy and sell pollution credits for more flexibility.

Last of three parts
\
More than 15 years after the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect under President Bill Clinton, labor leaders and politicians are still bemoaning the negative effects they said it's had on manufacturing.
\
About a decade has passed since trade relations with China were normalized, and it's been almost that long since President George W. Bush took office. Yet Ohio continues to lose factory jobs to the Chinese and to nations the United States trades with as a result of Mr. Bush's aggressive free-market policies.
\
And nearing two years into his presidency, President Obama has yet to rewrite the trade agreements he campaigned against as being harmful to American manufacturers and that he promised to overhaul.
\
""It took us 30 years to get into this mess,"" said Tim Burga, chief of staff for the Ohio AFL-CIO. ""This is some hard stuff to reverse all of a sudden.""
\
No small amount of political capital has been spent on global trade and the role it's had in the decline of U.S. manufacturing, especially in northwest
\
Ohio and southeast Michigan.
\
On Sunday, a Blade investigation showed that about 170 factories closed in the region since Jan. 1, 2000. Global competition was an obvious factor in 47 closings that The Blade counted that resulted in work being shifted to other countries.
\
For example, Textileather Corp., a Toledo factory producing fabric for car interiors, closed last year, cutting 160 jobs and shipping work to Canada and China. Much of the production at New Mather Metals, a Toledo stabilizer-bar maker with 168 employees that closed this year, was shifted to Mexico.
\
Foreign trade also may have tangentially affected the 61 factory closings that resulted in work being shifted to other states, as dirt-cheap labor costs in other countries caused some companies to relocate to states where labor costs were lowest and where labor unions were scarce.
\
According to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, 5,055 displaced workers in northwest Ohio qualified for federal assistance in 2010 because of job losses caused by trade, compared with 3,244 who qualified last year.
\
A bevy of other factors contributed to factories closing and shifting work out of the region. Those factors include taxes and regulations, a shrinking American automotive industry, high labor costs and strong unions, and a national recession.
\
After decades of lost jobs and mounting frustrations, most of the attention is still paid to global trade and how to deal with its negative effects. Republicans, Democrats, labor leaders, and economists almost daily decry this country's $289 billion trade deficit and the effect it has on American workers.
\
But they want more than a shift in trade strategy. They also call for an evolution in how the United States approaches manufacturing and economic development.
\
With at least 21,500 jobs lost in the last 10 years in greater Toledo to factory closings, and many more thousands to corporate downsizing and outsourcing, how much those strategies shift could largely determine the region's economic future.
\
Taking a stand
\
U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D., Toledo) has a track record of opposing trade agreements she says she believes would harm American manufacturers.
\
In other words, Miss Kaptur has opposed numerous trade agreements in her nearly three decades representing the 9th Congressional District.
\
She voted against the landmark NAFTA legislation in 1993 pushed by President Bill Clinton, voted against the Central American Free Trade Agreement in 2005 backed by President George W. Bush, and opposed normalized trade relations with China.
\
""We are competing against countries that close their markets,"" Miss Kaptur said. ""It's a failure of top policy makers in Washington that our businesses are competing against countries that practice mercantilist capitalism.""
\
Miss Kaptur co-sponsored a bill in March for the United States to withdraw from NAFTA. She had cited NAFTA, which came into effect in 1994, for the loss of more than 1 million U.S. jobs through trade with Mexico and Canada.
\
Trade proponents argue that the net job losses actually caused by NAFTA are minimal and that trade with North American nations is essential. From June, 2009, to June, 2010, Ohio exported $10.4 billion in goods to Canada and Mexico.
\
The Republican challenger to Miss Kaptur in Ohio's 9th Congressional District, businessman Rich Iott, said a high U.S. corporate tax rate is what's driving manufacturing jobs out of northwest Ohio to foreign locations.
\
""We need to get our corporate tax rate in line with our global competitors,"" he said of the average combined American corporate tax rate of about 39.2 percent - second highest in the world. ""It's not a trade issue. We don't have the environment in this country that's good for businesses to thrive.""
\
The China syndrome
\
The biggest factor in America's trade problem - in both sheer size and complexity - is China. The U.S. trade deficit with China so far this year tops $145 billion, and the Chinese are also the top foreign holders of U.S. debt.
\
China is often accused of holding down the value of its currency against the dollar, closing off its markets to imports, dumping products in the United States to flood markets, and having lax regulations and cheap labor.
\
The United Steelworkers union recently filed a petition with the U.S. trade representative against China for violating World Trade Organization rules through its multibillion-dollar subsidies for alternative energy and strict limits on imports - two actions that would surely harm greater Toledo's growing solar industry.
\
Last week, President Obama reportedly pushed China Prime Minister Wen Jiabao to revalue Chinese currency.
\
But Miss Kaptur said the Obama Administration hadn't done enough overall to create more global market parity.
\
""I haven't seen any change in this administration and I haven't seen the sophistication in the trade office to try to deal with the asymmetries in the marketplace,"" she said.
\
In March, the liberal Economic Policy Institute released a study showing the United States lost 2.4 million jobs as a result of its deficit with China from 2001 through 2008, including 91,800 jobs in Ohio. The state's 5th U.S. Congressional District, represented by Republican Bob Latta, lost 6,700 factory jobs to China - the most of any Ohio congressional district.
\
""There's a real fear in Washington of getting the Chinese upset,"" Mr. Latta said. ""For America to be successful, we have to hold the Chinese accountable and we have to get out there and compete.""
\
Unfulfilled pledges
\
Ken Lortz, regional director for the United Auto Workers in Ohio, is, like Miss Kaptur, a Democrat and a supporter of Mr. Obama.
\
He also aligns with Miss Kaptur in his criticism of the current administration's track record on trade.
\
""I'm disappointed in the Obama Administration,"" Mr. Lortz said. ""He said he was going to rewrite NAFTA. He hasn't done a damn thing to rewrite NAFTA.""
\
Mr. Lortz is upset that this same discussion - and inaction - on trade persists, and much of his anger is directed toward Republicans.
\
He cited former U.S. Rep. Rob Portman, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Ohio, as an architect of what Mr. Lortz said were harmful trade policies when Mr. Portman served as President George W. Bush's trade representative from May, 2005, to May, 2006.
\
Asked to respond to Mr. Lortz's criticism, the Portman campaign instead attacked Mr. Portman's opponent, Ohio's Democratic Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher.
\
""Nearly nine out of every 10 [jobs] that left [Ohio] went to other states that have rolled out the welcome mat for Ohio's workers while the Buckeye State's elected officials like Lee Fisher have been slamming the door in their faces,"" Jessica Towhey, Mr. Portman's campaign press secretary, wrote in an e-mail to The Blade.
\
Leveling the field
\
What Mr. Lortz, Miss Kaptur, and other trade reformers want is the enforcement of environmental, labor, and import regulations in other countries that put U.S. companies at a disadvantage when such rules are ignored.
\
They want countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, and Germany to allow more American-made products across their borders and they want the U.S. government to cease providing incentives for American corporations to ship jobs overseas.
\
Mr. Obama and Democrats in Congress scored a victory on one of those fronts over the summer, when a bill funneling billions of dollars to states to save teachers' jobs was paid for by ending a multibillion-dollar tax break for companies conducting business in other countries.
\
With Ron Bloom, the President's former automotive czar, as Mr. Obama's senior adviser for manufacturing, at least a portion of the administration's manufacturing strategy involves growing the alternative energy sector through federal cash incentives.
\
Greater Toledo, with an estimated 6,000 people employed in the emerging solar industry and millions of dollars in research dedicated to solar development at the University of Toledo, could stand to gain if Mr. Obama's strategy is successful.
\
Mr. Burga, a top official for the AFL-CIO in Ohio, said that more must be done to bring fairness to global markets if any manufacturing strategy based on growing new industry and retraining workers is to succeed.
\
""The American people have to weigh in on what they want the economy to look like,"" Mr. Burga said. ""Right now we have an investor's economy where as long as shareholders get what they want everything is OK. We have to figure out if we want a worker's economy.""
\
The state's role
\
Ohio economic development officials deny that the state has shifted from cultivating its traditional manufacturing base to focusing more on building a new one through high-tech ventures.
\
But under current Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland, and his predecessor, Republican Bob Taft, the state has poured billions of dollars into research and development of new technologies through programs such as Ohio's Third Frontier.
\
Mr. Strickland also has worked to position the state as a competitor in alternative energy by establishing renewable energy standards that are expected to create a market for the solar panels made at First Solar Inc.'s factory in Perrysburg Township.
\
Steve Weathers, president and chief executive of the Regional Growth Partnership, a nonprofit economic development agency in northwest Ohio, admits his organization has shifted strategies.
\
Mr. Weathers said the Regional Growth Partnership is more focused on growing new companies than on recruiting companies from other states. He pointed to the 75 start-up companies in bioscience, alternative energy, and advanced manufacturing launched by the Third Frontier-funded Rocket Ventures program over the past two years.
\
""We hope to reach 100 new technology companies,"" Mr. Weathers said. ""We still look to recruit manufacturers, we still look to retain manufacturers ... but we always are trying to plant new crops.
\
""Evolve and go forward. We have to always remind ourselves that we need to move forward. We want to be competitive.""
\
Mr. Weathers said the growth partnership's strategy for local investment and growth - up-and-coming Toledo solar panel maker Xunlight Corp. is a client of the Rocket Ventures program - is a result of challenges facing the region.
\
He said a shrinking American automotive industry, old buildings, and cash incentives offered by other states take Toledo out of contention for some companies looking to consolidate and relocate.
\
""Is our infrastructure evolving to meet the needs of tomorrow's manufacturing?"" Mr. Weathers asks. ""Are the incentives we offer, the training we offer, the skill sets we offer - are they evolving to meet the needs of tomorrow's manufacturers? It's a question mark.""
\
Local interests
\
Any shift from traditional manufacturing at the state and regional levels puts more pressure on local development officials to protect and cultivate factory work in their towns.
\
Especially in communities far from research institutions such as the University of Toledo, it could be years before the developments in new technologies such as solar panels in Toledo could benefit small cities such as Fostoria and Upper Sandusky - both hard hit by factory closings.
\
Joan Reinhard, executive director of the Fostoria Economic Development Corp., said her community is working to improve its roads and railways to attract new businesses. She also said she remains diligent to her existing business surveys to identify and try to eliminate barriers for growth in Fostoria.
\
The city has suffered four plant closings totaling about 600 jobs in two years.
\
""I think everybody is in the same position, we have to fend for ourselves to a certain extent,"" Ms. Reinhard said. ""Yes, the economy stinks, but it's not going to get better unless we make it better.""
\
And in Upper Sandusky, where 845 factory jobs have been shed since 2005, Mayor Scott Washburn said he has no choice but to take a micro approach to economic development.
\
""We attack it job by job,"" he said. ""We'd all like to land that 500-person factory, but in reality, that's not gonna happen.""
\
Robert Reich, a liberal economist who was secretary of labor under President Clinton and was on President-elect Obama's transition team, told The Blade that federal or state lawmakers could lend a hand.
\
He said communities that lose major employers should receive federal funds to attract or develop new businesses and that the federal government also could require any profitable company to pay everyone it lays off severance equal to their last monthly wage times number of years worked.
\
Mr. Latta, the Republican congressman, blames Ohio's manufacturing losses on government policies to curb oil drilling and limit coal use, to extend the 2009 stimulus package, to enact this year's health-care reform, and a failed cap-and-trade energy proposal.
\
When pushed to explain his stance, given that the region was bleeding manufacturing jobs before the stimulus bill, health-care reform, and cap-and-trade policy were up for debate, Mr. Latta said:
\
""Every time I walk into a factory in my district, I know what the workers are going to say. ... They want Washington to quit killing American entrepreneurship.""
\
A 3-PART SERIES
\
Yesterday: About 170 factories with 21,500 employees closed in
\
northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan since Jan. 1, 2000, devastating the region's economy. Who gained from our pain? Try Indiana.
\
Today: Four years after a factory closed in Archbold and relocated
\
to Tennessee, workers are still reeling from lost paychecks, no health
\
insurance, and houses they can't afford. Meanwhile, the out-of-town
\
corporate executives who closed the plant continue to rake in millions.
\
An American tale.
\
Tomorrow: Fifteen years after NAFTA, we're still talking about the negative side effects of international trade. Though trade has played a role in the region's rash of factory closings, it will take a shift in trade, manufacturing,
\
and economic development strategies to turn the Toledo region around.

\
WOOSTER -- Four Republicans are vying for the opportunity to unseat incumbent U.S. Rep. John Boccieri, an Alliance Democrat who is in his first term representing Ohio's 16th Congressional District.
\
Matt Miller, a former two-term Ashland County commissioner and business administrator of the Salvation Army Ray & Joan Kroc Corps Community Center, is running a third time for the seat formerly held by Ralph Regula. He said his top priorities will be fiscal responsibility and job creation.
\
""We have to get our federal government spending under control,"" Miller said. ""The deficits we are running up have a very real impact on job creation here in our country.""
\
When touring area companies and manufacturing facilities, Miller said corporate managers have told him they could hire additional employees because they have work, but they are concerned about what the government will do next.
\
""The No. 1 concern of our residents in the 16th District is job creation, and the legislation being passed in Washington these days will have a devastating impact on (a company's) ability to create new jobs for citizens,"" Miller said.
\
Jim Renacci, former mayor of Wadsworth and chief executive officer of LTC Management, said he is running because he is concerned about the kind of future his children and grandchildren will face. He has balanced budgets as a businessman and as mayor of Wadsworth, and he said he will be fiscally responsible in Washington, D.C. LTC Management is a financial consulting firm which has been able to turn around struggling companies.
\
Renacci said the top concerns are spending, mounting deficits and jobs. As someone who has employed 2,500 people and created 1,500 new jobs, Renacci said he has the background to get in the U.S. House and work with 434 other representatives to get the budget in line and stop the spending spree that Washington is on.
\
Paul Schiffer, a Canton native and radio talk show host, said after fighting for conservative causes, like the pro-life movement, for the past 20 years, he believes it is time to move from talking and lobbying and make a real difference by running for Congress.
\
""People are fed up with the change,"" Schiffer said. ""Government trying to take over control of everything. My motto: Reverse the change. I am going to crusade for conservative causes and limited government.""
\
If elected, Schiffer said his No. 1 goal is to reverse anything voted on over the past year that has contributed to increasing the size of government. He said he wants to get rid of cap-and-trade and will fight to repeal health care reform enacted into law. He described himself as a Reagan Republican who is against tax increases, against corporate tax and the estate tax, which he calls the ""death tax.""
\
H. Doyle Smith, a retired accountant who has been active in politics since 1952, sums up why he is running in this way: ""We need a representative of the district in Washington, rather than a representative of Washington in the district.""
\
Smith said the most pressing issue is how ""we cannot compete with foreign imports because prices are too low. We need to require all imports be billed into the country at a price no less than what it could be produced for at 90 percent in U.S.""
\
Such a measure would allow this country's manufacturers to compete on quality, appearance and safety.
\
Smith also would like to emulate the constituent services provided when Regula was in office. ""If (constituents) have a problem Congress can help with them, we will respond as promptly and as quickly as possible,"" he said.
\
Miller's plan to help American corporations compete includes reducing the corporate tax rate. He said when state and federal corporate taxes are combined, they amount to about 39.3 percent, second only to Japan.
\
""Some people will say why give corporations another benefit, but the truth is, corporations don't pay taxes, you and I do,"" Miller said. ""The consumer pays the taxes in the form of higher prices for these products.""
\
Miller also sees a need to reduce energy costs, and he would help in that effort by allowing American companies to drill for oil on some of the federally owned lands and offshore.
\
Miller supports free trade, but it must be fair, he said. ""We need to revisit some of our country's trade policies if we want our companies to compete with foreign competitors who are subsidized by their governments,"" he added.
\
Renacci said no representative or senator should be sent back to Washington who voted for the cap-and-trade legislation. About 80 percent of Ohio's energy comes from coal, he said, adding the legislation is a ""travesty"" and will hurt the state's coal mining industry.
\
He estimated a business owner might pay 25-35 percent more in energy costs, adding the average residential user will pay about $1,200 more per year for electricity.
\
However, U.S. Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), one of the co-sponsors of cap-and-trade, said the cost would amount to the cost of a postage stamp per day. Renacci said he did not think the congressman has seen the numbers for Ohio. Renacci's approach would be to create tax credits for companies to move toward clean energy, not penalize them.
\
Schiffer said he would like to revisit the Contract with America, a set of proposals set forth by Republicans when they took over the U.S. House and Senate in the 1994 general election. He particularly is interested in reducing the regulatory power of the Department of Labor, which he said has been wreaking havoc on small businesses.
\
Another federal agency Schiffer wants to see diminished in power and scope is the Environmental Protection Agency. He said its regulations have been hurting small businesses.
\
""The bottom line is (the federal government) is using the environment or threats to the environment as a reason or justification to impose on the American people socialistic controls and regulations,"" Schiffer said.
\
Smith said it is important to make U.S. companies more competitive because a lot of other issues depend upon making it possible for people to find work. He said the government needs to secure and safeguard Social Security and increase medical services, not medical coverage.
\
""The future of the country is dependent upon our youth being able to thrive and survive,"" Smith said.
\
He said the government bailouts of banks and automakers were just gimmicks.
\
""They are bandages put on a bigger problem rather than a solution to the problem,"" he added. The bigger problem is finding a way for people to obtain money they do not have to pay back, namely through earnings, Smith said. When people earn money, they do not have to pay it back to a bank. However, when they rely on credit, that is money that has to be paid back, he said.
\
All four candidates expressed problems with health care reform.
\
Miller said he would have voted against it because the government does not have the money to cover existing obligations to Medicare and Medicaid.
\
Renacci said he disagreed with the bill as approved. He said there were two problems that needed to be addressed: Cost and coverage. He said he does like the end of pre-existing conditions and the elimination of a cap on medical coverage.
\
Schiffer said he wants to repeal the measure.
\
Smith said health care reform legislation added more people for medical services but did not add one doctor.
\
""It's law now, and I don't see it being repealed,"" Smith said. ""We might be able to adjust some things.""

The White House was more successful Wednesday forcing a private company to set up a $20 billion fund to pay for damage from the oil spill than it has been in stemming the flow of crude fouling the Gulf of Mexico.
\
Chances are that BP stood to be held accountable through legal avenues even without the agreement reached with the Obama administration. The government, motivated by politics and public emotion, isn't the best arbiter of liability, particularly after the fact. If existing tort provisions prove inadequate, they should be adjusted to provide proportionate incentives before, and appropriate liability after, disasters. But this should be done legislatively, not by administrative fiat in the heat of crisis. We suspect the administration may hike its $20 billion requirement as tolls mount, and new constituencies are heard from.
\
Clearly, government is good at coercing money from companies needing government approval to operate. Government's not so adept at dealing with catastrophes such as an unprecedented two-month oil leak 5,000 feet underwater.
\
Despite insisting it is in control, the Obama administration can do little to stem the flow of oil and, apparently, little to clean it up. But government can wield power elsewhere and pretend that addresses the problem.
\
Republicans say President Barack Obama is exploiting the Gulf crisis to push an unwanted energy policy capping greenhouse gas emissions and forcing companies to buy and trade emissions credits. That will have no effect on the spill or on the reality of America continuing to largely rely on oil for decades. But cap and trade can be very profitable for the government, which will take its cut in fees and taxes while controlling the faux carbon market.
\
Democrats in Congress, including Ohio's Sen. Sherrod Brown, have sent mixed signals about their willingness to sign on to cap and trade. Those from states like Ohio rightly worry about the effect the bill would have on those states' industries. At the same time, claiming they have the cure-all for the environment is standard Democratic operating procedure. Obama isn't going to miss a chance to exploit a crisis like the oil spill.
\
The administration also is inflicting unintended consequences by imposing a six-month moratorium on deep-water drilling, resulting in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. Unintended consequences go hand in hand with clumsy government ""solutions."" Hazardous deep-sea drilling is conducted largely because governmental prohibits much safer, easier to manage shallow-water drilling closer to shore.
\
The federal government has no particular oil-well-capping expertise of its own, and its bureaucratic maze is notoriously lethargic when quick responses are needed, such as after Hurricane Katrina and the Gulf oil spill. For example, after eight weeks of waiting on BP and federal authorities, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has ordered the National Guard to drop sand bags by helicopter to keep oil from reaching shore.
\
BP and other culpable parties will, and should, face considerable expense as a consequence of this disaster. (Bank of America Merrill Lynch this week ordered its traders not to enter into oil trades with BP that extend beyond June 2011, Reuters reported Wednesday). What the Gulf oil spill should not be is another excuse to swell even further the Obama administration's ever-expanding administrative authority. And it's certainly not an excuse for a contrived, economically punitive cap-and-trade system ripe for abuse.
\
Firms participating in a worldwide carbon scheme already abuse it by artificially inflating their greenhouse gas emissions, which allows rich nations to boost emissions, Reuters reports. For example, chemical plants maximize production of a potent gas because of a financial incentive - getting paid via the offset scheme to destroy the same gas.
\
The U.S. needs cap and trade like it needs another oil spill.

\
WOOSTER -- ""Take care of people.""
\
That's the simple advice from Ralph Regula, former representative of Ohio's 16th Congressional District, to the next one, Jim Renacci.
\
Renacci, a Republican, defeated incumbent John Boccieri, a Democrat, and two other challengers in Tuesday's mid-term elections.
\
""If we had any success, it was because we took care of our constituents,"" said Regula, a Navarre Republican who served 18 terms in the U.S. House. ""We were sensitive to their concerns. I was a moderate by political standards, and I tried to do what was right for the 16th District.""
\
The 16th District, which includes all of Wayne and Stark counties, most of Medina County and part of Ashland County, is a microcosm of America, Regula said. It has industry, farms, unions and colleges. The national media must have recognized this, he said, because he was getting calls from them wanting to know how things were shaping up.
\
Tuesday's outcomes, which saw historic gains for the Republicans in the House, was ""a referendum on the Obama administration, quite frankly, and (Speaker of the House Nancy) Pelosi,"" Regula said. ""People said we are not happy with what's happening in Washington, we are not happy with building debt for the future of country.""
\
So, they changed the people who were calling the shots in Congress, he added.
\
Regula also said the election results were a referendum on health care reform and cap-and-trade, with the former likely being a factor in Democratic Congressman Zack Space's defeat to Republican Bob Gibbs, a state senator from Lakeville.
\
Gibbs, too, needs to listen to his constituents and take care of their needs when he gets to Washington, Regula said.
\
""When the people would call in, I used to tell my staff, a little tongue-in-cheek, if they didn't get their order from Sears Roebuck, help them get it,"" Regula said. ""I told (the staff), 'I'm not a congressman, I'm a representative to Congress.""
\
Boccieri also had some words of advice for his successor.
\
""I told him (election night) things will now start coming like a Nolan Ryan fastball,"" Boccieri said. Renacci will have to be a quick study, and ""he will be able to do that based on what I saw on the campaign trail.""
\
When Renacci attends the orientation for freshmen congressmen at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government he will be asked whether he will be willing to cast a vote for an important issue, even if it will cost him his job.
\
""Everyone says 'yes,'"" Boccieri said, however, will they be able to do it when faced with it.
\
Some have suggested Boccieri's votes in support of health care reform and cap-and-trade cost him his job. Though some Democrats around the country distanced themselves from those issues, Boccieri stood by them, saying history will prove they were the correct decisions.
\
""We're all on borrowed time,"" Boccieri said, adding political careers are based on the will of the electorate.
\
When Renacci gets to Washington, D.C., he will walk into an environment where there are 400 lobbyists for every congressman, Boccieri said. There will be a large number of people and every special interest group who will want access to Renacci, and he will need to be able to listen to everything, sort it all out and make the best choice for the district, Boccieri added.
\
When Renacci and Gibbs go to Washington, Regula said they need to be sensitive to things like health care reform and cap-and-trade, two issues the people don't like.
\
Both Renacci and Gibbs promised to repeal health care reform on the campaign trail and were outspoken opponents of cap-and-trade.
\
Regula, who described himself as a moderate politically, said he thinks the Democrats got too far ahead of the public, which was not ready for health care reform.
\
""You can't get too far ahead of the people,"" Regula said. ""I think Obama has to bear some of the responsibility for this.""
\
Where the administration and leadership missed the boat was being so focused on health care they forgot about jobs, said Regula, who would often pull out his wallet and tell others, ""This is what elections are all about.
\
""Former Gov. Jim Rhodes said he could talk about jobs in 20 different languages. He never forgot about the ordinary guy and having jobs.""
\
Regula said he believes Renacci, with all of his business experience, and Gibbs, with his legislative experience at the state level, will do well in Congress.
\
Regula, also a former state legislator like Gibbs, said in Washington ""the ball game is the same, except the fences are a lot farther out.""
\
Boccieri said it has been an absolute honor to serve the people of the 16th District and appreciated the voters for giving him the opportunity.

It's likely a sign of desperation that national security is increasingly invoked as an excuse for waging war on global warming. Worried that groups of concerned citizens are protesting the economic costs of your drastic environment plans, as happened (again) Friday in Lima? Simple: Just say it's about national security.
\
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., says global warming will create ""climate refugees"" and bring international conflicts. The U.S. military, the reasoning goes, will have to intervene in massive humanitarian efforts or with force. This echoes President Barack Obama's depiction of global warming as an alleged ""national security"" threat.
\
A Defense Department think tank now predicts changing climate will create international instability. Retired Army Gen. Anthony Zinni warns we must pay now to avert global warming, or pay later militarily. Former Sen. John Warner, in conjunction with the Pew Environmental Group, says there's a ""critical link"" between national security and global warming.
\
The message is: Impose Draconian solutions like the pending cap-and-trade bill in Congress, for the sake of national security.
\
Everyone should take a deep breath. These scary warnings are predicated on assumptions based on worst-case scenarios, and are far from proven.
\
Even if seas and temperatures rise, and hurricanes increase, cap-and-trade greenhouse gas regulations would have next to no effect. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson concedes, ""U.S. action alone will not impact world CO2 levels."" Climatologist Chip Knappenberger says Waxman-Markey regulations would moderate temperatures no more than two-tenths of a degree over a century.
\
It's just as likely cap-and-trade regulations pose national security threats of their own by stifling economic growth, creating energy scarcity and making fragile nations even more so, says James Jay Carafano, a Heritage Foundation research fellow. Such economy-strangling measures would weaken U.S. economic competitiveness and military preparedness, he says.
\
Rick Gerdeman, the CEO of St. Marys-based Midwest Electric and one of the speakers at Friday's rally in Lima, said the average impact to residential consumers would be a 21 percent rate increase. That would mean paying an average of $26 more a month per household. That extra monthly charge might seem small, but it's more than $300 on average each of Ohio's more than 4.5 million households would be paying. That massive drain on bank accounts - considering the effect on a national scale - would cripple an already weak economy.
\
But $26 per month extra going toward your electric bill is an optimistic estimate. Some have the average electric bill increase $65 every month. Are you ready to pay $780 more every year for your electric bill? What do you suppose would happen to Ohio as its residents alone paid an extra $3.5 billion for electricity every year?
\
We must remember global warming predictions are based on unproved computer-model projections tying temperature to greenhouse gas emissions. But those predictions are worst-case scenarios, cherry-picked from two dozen models, all based on incomplete data. Missing from the calculations is what may be the most influential factor, cloud cover, the effect of which no one understands. Meanwhile, greenhouse gas emissions have soared for a decade, but temperatures have leveled and even declined. The nation should resist being stampeded into another costly 1,200 pages of barely read, poorly understood ""solutions.""

38,"WASHINGTON -- It was a global warming throwdown. At a hearing Thursday of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., the committee chair, fairly gushed about a climate change bill introduced by Sens. John Warner, RVa., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., calling it the ""strongest global warming bill, the most far-reaching in the world."" \The bill would place a cap on most carbon dioxide emissions starting in 2012. At first it would limit emissions to 2005 levels, but by 2050 it aims to cut emissions by 70 percent. \It also creates a market to trade emission allowances, allowing companies that can reduce emissions below the cap to sell the right to discharge additional emissions to firms that can't or don't want to make the cuts. \The plan has been lauded by environmentalists, but not everyone is smitten with the bill. \Among them is Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio. \He has argued the United States should be spending money instead on technology that can capture such emissions. \He worries that while the United States embraces such changes, other countries will continue to increase emissions, meaning the nation will adopt a program that will cost even more manufacturing jobs to countries such as China. Even worse, he argues, the problem won't go away, because other countries will continue to pollute. \But his problems Thursday were largely procedural. \""I acknowledge your commitment to timely legislation,"" he told Boxer, ""but the abbreviated process by which this legislation is moving is not conducive to good public policy."" \The bill, he said, was introduced Oct. 18 and rushed through subcommittee, passing Nov. 1. The committee, he said, planned to have just one more hearing before voting on the bill. \It was too much, too soon, he said. \""At this point, it is not possible to assess the costs and benefits of this bill,"" he said, adding that the Senate has not studied how the legislation will impact the Gross Domestic Product or the price, supply and reliability of electricity, gasoline and other commodities. \""I'm asking, could you slow it down?"" he asked, implying Boxer wanted it passed in time to present it at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali in December. \The criticism chafed Boxer, who said the committee had 20 hearings on global warming, though not specifically on the legislation. \""The fact is this is an urgent problem,"" she said. ""We are not rushing this through."" \She said the bill was ""carefully thought out"" and would solve a problem that is growing increasingly dire. And the United States, she said, has already embraced a similar cap and trade program for acid rain. \""The American people are tired of ... us not getting anything done,"" she said. ""They see this issue coming at them; they're very concerned about it."" \Voinovich will get another crack at getting his point across. There will be another hearing before a vote is taken."

WOOSTER -- As Rob Portman campaigns across Ohio for a U.S. Senate seat, he said his top three issues are jobs, jobs and jobs.
\
Portman was in town for a private fundraiser held at the home of Jim and Sue Smail, which wrapped up a three-day, RV tour of North Central Ohio.
\
After George Voinovich announced he would not seek re-election, Portman said he looked around and saw what was happening to Ohio's and the country's economy and realized he could make a difference.
\
The Cincinnati-area Republican said he believed it was important to give the economy a jump start, but he would have supported a different stimulus package, one that would have a lot less government spending and more tax cuts. He said the stimulus should have been timely, targeted toward job creation and be temporary. He said Ohio has lost 100,000 jobs since the recovery legislation was enacted.
\
He recently spoke at a Tea Party, and though his comments were geared toward federal spending, Portman said people who approached him afterward wanted to talk about health care.
\
Senior citizens expressed concern about the rationing of health care, and they were worried they would not be able to make decisions with their doctors, rather those decisions would be made by someone else, Portman said.
\
""People are nervous about it,"" Portman said. ""If you look at the proposals in Washington, they all cost more.""
\
Portman said if the cap-and-trade legislation in Congress is passed, it will hurt Ohioans because of higher taxes. About 90 percent of the electricity in the state comes from coal-powered plants. Not only will residents see higher electric bills, but it will also hurt manufacturers, he added.
\
There needs to be clean air and the country needs to reduce its reliance on foreign oil, but Portman said he believes there are better ways to achieve those goals.
\
Green energy, like wind and solar, should be part of the mix, but so, too, should be nuclear power, he said.
\
""I think he is on the right track,"" Howard Wenger said after Portman's speech. He appreciated the candidate's comments about creating an environment where businesses can create jobs.
\
Wenger said the Republican Party has been in a ""down mood"" because of the 2008 elections, but Portman's enthusiasm to revive the party is impressive.
\
Jack Miller, chief executive officer of Miller Supply, also liked Portman's remarks about having the government be friendly toward business. He also agreed the country needs smart and effective regulations that do not handicap businesses.
\
Jim Smail said the fundraiser was a record-setter for Wayne County. About 66 people signed up for the event, with even more showing up.
\
""I've heard nothing but extremely positive comments,"" Jim Smail said.
\
Portman, an attorney, served as associate White House counsel and later director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs for President George H.W. Bush. He served as a U.S. representative for Ohio's 2nd District from 1993-2005, when he was appointed by George W. Bush to be the U.S. trade representative. He served in that for a year until the younger Bush appointed him to be director of the Office of Management and Budget.

40,"WASHINGTON -- In the waning hours before Congress broke for its July 4 recess, House Minority Leader John Boehner, RWest Chester, stepped onto the House floor and spent an hour decrying a cap and trade bill that he had taken to calling ""Nancy Pelosi's energy tax."" \His staff cleverly called Boehner's speech a ""Fili-Boehner,"" but ultimately the speech didn't appear to reverse the Democrats' will: The bill passed 219-212. \Boehner may have needed to spend the recess preserving his voice. The political scrapping has just begun. \While the climate change bill now goes to the U.S. Senate, where the sparks are expected to really fly, Congress also is wrangling with a handful of controversial topics with a huge impact on Ohio. \Here's a look at the two biggies: \Climate change \Ohio opponents of this bill have all but predicted an apocalypse for the state if Congress adopts this measure, which would require utility plants to have an emission permit for every ton of carbon dioxide it produced. Plants that reduced emissions could sell their extra permits to others. \Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, is among the most vocal opponents. He helped kill a similar measure last year that he predicted would hike Ohioans' energy costs by as much as 50 percent. \Sen. Sherrod Brown, DOhio, meanwhile, has slowly become a supporter. He said the plan provides opportunities for the state's burgeoning clean energy industry, and cites Toledo as an example of an Ohio city that has become a center for so-called green jobs. \Brown, too, has expressed concern about higher energy costs. But he said he's excited about the job opportunities the bill could create. He heralded the passage of the House bill, which included a Brown provision to create a revolving loan fund for small and medium-size manufacturers. \The bill has yet to pass a Senate committee, and Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid has signaled he wants committees to finish their work by September so it can clear Congress by the end of the year. One of those committees the bill must pass through is the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, where Voinovich is a senior member. He says the measure will bleed already struggling households with higher energy costs, particularly in Ohio, where coal accounts for 86 percent of the state's energy resources. \Opinions of the bill's impact also differ among Ohio think tanks. \Wendy Patton, a senior associate and federal policy liaison with Policy Matters Ohio, testified in late June that the bill could help generate jobs in Ohio. \She cited a recent study by the Pew Charitable Trust that found more than 2,000 firms with more than 32,000 workers serving in green markets in Ohio. She said if demand for clean energy continues to skyrocket, Ohio could take advantage of even more opportunity. She also called for provisions in the legislation to help mitigate the price impact. \But Marc Kilmer of the conservative Buckeye Institute predicted something closer to catastrophe. \He's reluctant to forecast how much Ohioans' energy bills would increase if the House measure passed but, ""I would say it will be a significant increase."" He said energy producers will need to pass on costs to consumers to stay afloat as the new regulation is put in place. \Health care \Just as Voinovich sits on a committee with key jurisdiction over the climate change bill, Brown sits on the Senate Health, Environment, Labor and Pensions Committee, which spent the July 4 recess hammering out details of comprehensive health care reform. On July 2, Brown and two other senators -- Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island -- announced that committee Democrats had ironed out a deal. It would include both a public option as well as employer responsibility provisions. Those provisions would require employers who couldn't provide health insurance to at least foot part of the bill for employees to use the public option. \Brown touted the measure as competition that would spur both the public and private insurance options to succeed. In some cases, he said, the public option would be available where a private option has not been. \The plan, he said, ""will reward quality, and it will reward best practices."" \The committee hopes to vote on their bill as soon as late this week. The Senate Finance Committee also must pass a bill as well. \According to Policy Matters Ohio, more than 1 million Ohioans, or 11 percent of those under the age of 65, do not have health insurance. \Kilmer, of the Buckeye Institute, said he expects the results to be pricey. The high cost of the estimated $1 trillion-over-10-years plan, he said will mean ""higher taxes to pay for the bill at the end of the day."" \""I don't see much in these proposals that will help the average Ohioan,"" he said. ""People will be paying more in taxes and probably paying more for health insurance."" \Nancy Martorano, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Dayton, however, is more optimistic. She said properly implemented, health care legislation could give Ohioans without health care new opportunities in a struggling economy. \""For some Ohioans, it might actually help them get coverage when they're not able normally to afford coverage,"" she said. ""It's sort of unclear. It depends on what kind of health care package gets passed."" \Brian Rothenberg of ProgressOhio, a progressive Ohio organization that supports Democratic health care reform proposals, said southwest Ohio has much to gain from health care reform. He said Anthem, Wellpoint and United dominate the market in this corner of the state, and a new government option might drive down costs. \The plan ""would actually tend to benefit southwest Ohio by creating a level of competition among an industry that's dominated by two or three insurance companies,"" he said. ""This is one area where a government plan would actually create competition.""\Credit: By Jessica Wehrman Staff Writer"

In the early 1990s, Bill Hayes started his career as a lawyer for the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency with a black-and-white view of the world. There were the good guys, who cared about the environment, and the bad guys, who polluted it.
\
Today, from the Vorys Sater law offices in the Atrium II building downtown, he's shed that us-versus-them view of the world. Now he works with companies to help them do their jobs in more environmentally-friendly ways. ""Someone once told me that it's more effective to be inside turning the knobs than outside banging on the glass,"" he says.
\
Though a few may still argue it, Hayes says the debate about whether Earth is experiencing global warming is over. Now the question is how to reduce the so-called greenhouse gases that break down the atmosphere.
\
Hayes, whose expertise is in air-quality regulation, works with Honda Motor Manufacturing's plants in Marysville, Ohio, and now in Greensburg, Ind. Greensburg, which opens this fall, is aiming to be a zero-landfill facility - recycling or reusing all the waste it generates. The Marysville plant reuses its industrial waste for toilet water and is adopting water-based coatings to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions during manufacturing.
\
Hayes is feeling more optimistic about the future for the environment than at any time in his career. That's because companies have found they can save money doing it.
\
In the past, Hayes says, ""companies had environmental compliance as an ancillary thing. They thought, 'These people may be keeping us out of trouble, but they're costing us money.'""
\
In recent years, several famous national examples have arisen of companies saving money by being environmentally friendly. Among them: Adobe Systems Inc. software company, which is saving $80,000 a year by using fluorescent light bulbs, and Bank of America, which uses its garbage to create methane gas that makes ice used to cool the building.
\
Vorys' office, and others locally including Deloitte - have installed motion detectors so the lights will go off if someone has left the room, or perhaps falls asleep. The move saves energy - and money.
\
In the future, Hayes says, he expects the U.S. will soon see some kind of cap-and-trade program. The government will put increasing regulations on the size of a company's carbon footprint, or impact on the environment, and companies that have low impact can sell or trade credits to companies that are struggling to meet the cap - a manufacturer with high air-polluting emissions, perhaps.
\
Helping to protect the environment has become a new business imperative, Hayes says, both because it often can save companies money and also because it's good PR.
\
""A company that doesn't make environmental issues part of their strategic plan,"" he says, ""is going to be left behind.""

42,"ZANESVILLE - Business and college officials gathered at Ohio University-Zanesville Monday night to discuss opportunities for the state to be in the forefront of clean energy solutions which create jobs.\During the ""Growing Green Jobs In Ohio"" panel discussion in the Elson Hall auditorium, information about the City of Zanesville's Lightmaster project, weatherization and energy efficiency efforts underway by the Corporation for Ohio Appalachian Development (COAD) and the importance of education in providing a workforce for the green economy was presented.\Mayor Howard Zwelling and officials with J Core, marketer of the Varmatic Lightmaster system, spoke about the cost savings that can be realized, the jobs the technology could create and the positive impact on the environment.\Zwelling said energy saving, saving the environment and creation of an economy based on green jobs was a ""great cause.""\""The Lightmaster, it's something that helps the economy, but also the environment,"" he said, noting that while the city saved about 28 percent on its street light energy usage last year, J Core has also committed to helping bring manufacturing of the Lightmaster product to Zanesville, as soon as this year.\He also said the cost savings also translates into about 71 tons less of pollutants being put into the air due to the efficiency of the Lightmaster.\Tom Calhoun, housing programs manager with COAD, touted the number of jobs that have been created within the last few months as community action agencies gear up to use federal stimulus funds to weatherize 6,000 homes over the next couple of years.\""Everything is linked. What better way to create jobs than by saving the environment,"" Calhoun said.\But it's going to take education to drive the point home, said Jerry Hutton a professor of Energy & Transportation Technologies at Hocking College.\""It's going to take a holistic approach, cutting across technologies.

""We need Congress to take strong action on climate legislation in 2009 to strengthen Ohio and our entire nation today and protect our planet for future generations.""\Congress is currently debating legislation to create a cap-and-invest system, which has been referred to as cap-and-trade, that would limit emissions, promote clean energy, and develop energy efficiency standards. Climate and energy legislation would also jump-start a new clean energy economy by enacting a national renewable electricity standard.\Opponents contend that capping current emissions would drive up consumer prices thousands of dollars annually over the next several years, putting further strain on an already over-taxed working class and canceling out the perceived benefits of shifting to alternative energy.\Others who took part in the panel included Marvin Paul from Paul's Farm Market, Chad Simpson with Simpson Heating and Cooling of New Philadelphia, MacKenzie Bailey with the Blue/Green Coalition and Greg DiDonato, Executive Director of the Ohio Mid-Eastern Governments Association.\bgadd@nncogannett.com\740-450-6752"

IN TAKING President Obama to task for a lack of leadership on climate change, former Vice President Al Gore expressed the frustration of many Americans who care about the environment. His comments were on target, but in Mr. Obama's defense, parsing the blame isn't easy.Mr. Gore understands that the situation is complicated. His criticism, in an article in Rolling Stone magazine, was prefaced by an expression of ""enormous empathy"" for the President, who came to office amid ""incredible challenges."" He said Mr. Obama has tried to lessen the nation's dependence on fossil fuels, and understands the connections between environmental security, economic security, and national security.But despite ""these and other achievements, President Obama has thus far failed to use the bully pulpit to make the case for bold action on climate change,"" Mr. Gore said. ""After successfully passing his green stimulus package, he did nothing to defend it when Congress decimated its funding. After the House passed cap-and-trade, he did little to make passage in the Senate a priority.""This criticism could be leveled at the general management style of a president who has been passionate and assertive at times, and cool and detached at others. But is the political antipathy to action on climate change all Mr. Obama's fault? Or has the silence of the bully pulpit merely reflected changing political realities, mirroring the verdict of American voters in last November's elections?Mr. Gore is himself not immune to charges of poor leadership. He did not become president, of course, but he has had his own bully pulpit, winning a share of the Nobel Peace Prize for pushing the climate-change cause.Yet for all his advocacy, he has become useful to critics as a risible stock character who personifies the alleged deficiencies of the scientific argument for man-made climate change. Never mind that the scientific consensus is overwhelmingly on his side.In the Rolling Stone article, Mr. Gore concedes the political difficulties and the effectiveness of the massed opposition to action against climate change, even to the extent of denying the problem.That the environmental cause has been losing the argument on climate change is clear from what is happening in Congress. GOP lawmakers have mounted radical attacks against the Environmental Protection Agency - which began under a Republican president, Richard Nixon, and is as vital now to combating greenhouse gases and other pollution as it was when Americans were shocked to see the Cuyahoga River catch fire.Last month, a GOP-led House committee advanced a bill that would gut the EPA's power to regulate states under the federal Clean Water Act. The legislation is a witch's brew that blends states' rights and environmental contempt. But not just Republicans are to blame; some Democrats voted for the measure.Whether Mr. Obama created the vacuum that invites such assaults, this hot-and-cold-running president should take Mr. Gore's friendly criticism seriously. The climate deniers and pollution enablers are overplaying their hand.At a time when something weird is going on with the weather, Americans may be in the mood to cheer if the President mounts the bully pulpit anew to give the environmental bullies what-for.

44,"I ran for Congress because I was fed up with the way Washington politicians were treating our workers, employers and families. With eight months under my belt representing the people of eastern Ohio, I can tell you that my opinion of the bureaucracy and red tape in Washington hasn't changed much. In fact, I don't think Washington, D.C., likes me much, either.\Washington bureaucrats don't like me because I am outspoken in working to end the ""red tape factory"" that has taken over government. ""Bureaucrat"" is a word that is used a lot in campaign speeches but is rarely defined. I define a bureaucrat as a federal employee who was not elected by any voting population, and therefore unaccountable to the public, yet still holds a tremendous amount of authority over policies that directly impact Americans.\Case in point: the Environmental Protection Agency. Throughout its history, the EPA has certainly helped make our country a better place to live, work and play. As a farmer and outdoorsman, I enjoy nature, clean water and clean air -- things the EPA was originally designed to protect. This behemoth organization has broad reach into the everyday lives of most Americans, whether they realize it or not.\However, the EPA is not the sole reason our environment has improved. The American entrepreneurial spirit encourages advances in technology and innovation that have and continue to result in a cleaner, healthier environment.\Under the Obama administration, the EPA has moved away from its intended purpose to ""create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony"" and is now implementing the personal agendas of radical environmentalists. Even after the congressional defeat of cap-and-trade, the EPA has begun implementing the job-destroying scheme through executive regulations. It even estimates one of the new rules alone to cost businesses $132 million the first year and add EPA oversight to 10,000 new facilities.\Ohio is coal country. Period. We mine coal, we burn coal, and we have tens of thousands of jobs from coal. Every time a constituent of District 18 turns on their lights, they are paying less for that energy because of coal. But unfortunately, the EPA is more worried about shutting down the fossil fuel industry entirely than it is about working with our coal industry and recognizing the incredible advances that have been made to clean up coal and its effect on the environment.\As chairman of the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee, I oversee the EPA's implementation of the Clean Water Act and see the results of their regulation rampage first hand.\That is why the EPA tops the list of Washington bureaucrats that do not like me very much. It doesn't like me because I'm working every day to put a stop to its attack on jobs and the American worker. It doesn't like that I consider one of my most important roles in Congress to stop out-of-touch bureaucrats from making decisions that take paychecks away from Ohio's families. And it especially doesn't like that I continuously pursue a legislative agenda that boosts economic growth through reducing the regulatory and tax burden.\In an article in the New York Times, I was referred to as the ""critic-in-chief"" of the Obama administration and the assault on our businesses in the name of clean water. I am, in fact, a critic of the Obama administration and its burdensome federal regulations that stifle economic growth, impose high costs on businesses and impede private sector investment and job creation.\If that means Washington doesn't like me much, it's OK because the feeling is mutual.\Bob Gibbs represents Ohio's 18th Congressional District.

The race for Ohio's 9th Congressional District hasn't made any of the political scorecards as one of those districts that could swing from Democratic to Republican control. But it's being fought like it could.
\
Incumbent U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D., Toledo) and Republican Rich Iott of Monclova Township are slugging it out with hard-hitting and expensive media campaigns.
\
Mr. Iott, who ran the former Seaway Food Town chain of grocery stores before it was sold to a new owner that closed the business, contends that Miss Kaptur is a ""career politician"" who has been caught up in a culture of trading federal ""pork"" for campaign contributions.
\
Miss Kaptur says Mr. Iott is a person who ""has no record of public service"" who ""destroyed"" the jobs of 5,000 Food Town employees.
\
""We have a spirited election campaign under way,"" Miss Kaptur said.
\
The contest already has drawn blood in the Kaptur campaign, although it was largely self-inflicted.
\
A Kaptur ad accused Mr. Iott of taking over Food Town from his father and running it ""straight into the ground.""
\
An analysis by The Blade concluded that however questionable the Food Town board's decision to sell to the larger Spartan Stores Inc. might have been, the ad's basic claim was false because the firm was profitable under Mr. Iott as president and chief executive officer from 1996 to 2000.
\
Mr. Iott has not pursued campaign threats to complain about the ad to the Ohio Elections Commission. But he said he was struck that an incumbent with 28 years of experience would use her first ad of the campaign to attack him.
\
""If I was that congressperson I'd be saying look at all the things I've done, look at my record,"" Mr. Iott said. ""Apparently she looked at her record and decided she didn't want to talk about it.""
\
He said he is prepared to spend more than $1 million in the fight to unseat Miss Kaptur - more than has ever been deployed against Miss Kaptur in her previous re-election efforts. Campaign finance records show that Mr. Iott's candidacy is mostly self-funded.
\
The GOP view
\
The 9th District race has yet to come under the scrutiny of national political handicappers such as realclearpolitics.com, indicating that it is still regarded as safely Democratic.
\
The political Web site is following five other Ohio district seats held by Democrats, but not the 9th. Tory Mazzola, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that in a normal political year incumbents such as Miss Kaptur and U.S. Rep. Betty Sutton (D., Barberton) in the adjacent 13th Congressional District would be easily re-elected.
\
He said the mood of the electorate and the strong effort being made by the Republican candidates in both districts are putting them in play.
\
Ms. Sutton is being challenged by businessman Tom Gangley.
\
""I think voters in Ohio have enough of higher taxes and reckless spending, and especially when you add to the fact that they've seen very little job creation as a result. So Marcy Kaptur's part of the problem,"" Mr. Mazzola said. ""That's why she's running scared.
\
""Ohio 9, Ohio 13 - in both of the districts but we have very good Republican challengers and we have a favorable environment,"" Mr. Mazzola said.
\
The Democratic view
\
Democrats don't see the Ohio 9th as in jeopardy.
\
""It's wishful thinking on the part of Republicans,"" said Ryan Rudominer, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ""In this environment no one is taking anything for granted and everyone is prepared for a really tough re-election and Kaptur is no exception. That said, she's in really strong shape for re-election and Rich Iott is someone who's really flawed.""
\
He said Miss Kaptur's record of opposition to international trade deals that have ""killed jobs"" and of ""helping build a world-class solar industry"" in Toledo have solidified her support in the district.
\
""If there is any buzz about the race with Richie Iott, it is just how many of the millions he made by selling off people's jobs at Food Town he will spend to try and buy a seat in Congress,"" Mr. Rudominer said.
\
The candidates
\
Mr. Iott won the Republican primary in May after starting off the race as an independent with some backing from local Tea Party activists.
\
A native of Columbus who was adopted by a Toledo family, Mr. Iott graduated from what is now Northview High School and attended college before quitting to join the family supermarket business.
\
He is in his 28th year as a member of the Ohio Military Reserve, a volunteer, state-sponsored reserve that trains regularly but which has never been activated into service.
\
Married with a son and a daughter, Mr. Iott has invested in start-up businesses, including a salsa and a science fiction movie production company.
\
Miss Kaptur is a native of Toledo who grew up in what she called a working-class, Polish-American home, graduating from St. Ursula Academy. Her father ran a grocery in Rossford but gave it up to get a factory job with paid health care. Miss Kaptur's mother was part of a union organizing drive at Champion Spark Plug Co.
\
Miss Kaptur worked as a planner for the Toledo-Lucas County Plan Commission and in 1977 became assistant director of urban affairs in the Carter administration's domestic policy staff.
\
In 1982, she ran for the seat then occupied by Republican Ed Weber, who two years earlier had upset longtime incumbent U.S. Rep. Thomas ""Lud"" Ashley (D., Toledo).
\
She is unmarried and commutes between the longtime family residence in Toledo and an apartment in Alexandria, Va.
\
Issues and earmarks
\
Miss Kaptur has been a strong opponent of international free-trade agreements. A Capitol Hill publication, The Hill, in June named her one of the 25 ""hardest-working"" members of Congress.
\
In 2009, Miss Kaptur criticized links between President Obama's economic appointees and Wall Street firms that received bailouts.
\
She is the most senior woman in the House, and is one seat away from the chairmanship of the powerful House Appropriations Committee - if she and the Democrats return to the majority.
\
This year, Miss Kaptur led the Ohio delegation in bringing home congressional ""earmarks"" - spending projects not authorized by the executive branch that are inserted in spending bills - $71.3 million worth.
\
""I am proud of earmarks that help my people across the region,"" said Miss Kaptur, who contends that Ohio does not get its fair share of federal funding.
\
Her projects include some of the funding for the Glass City Veterans Skyway, for which Miss Kaptur had $56 million inserted into congressional bills in 1991 and 1998, Miss Kaptur's staff says.
\
She called the $237 million bridge Toledo's ""civic cathedral in the sky"" at its 2007 dedication.
\
Miss Kaptur also cites her role in channeling $222 million to the 180th Fighter Wing Air National Guard unit based at Toledo Express Airport.
\
""It helped save the 180th,"" said Mary Chris Skeldon, Miss Kaptur's campaign spokesman. ""None of those dollars was through the Pentagon budget. It was just consistent funding year after year and it's one of the most modern fighter wing facilities in the country.""
\
Mr. Iott said he did not consider the Maumee River crossing to be an earmark-funded project but said earmarks have contributed to a ballooning national deficit because members of Congress approve each other's pet projects.
\
Miss Kaptur came under investigation by the House ethics committee for campaign contributions she received from lobbyists who had earmarks inserted in spending bills, but she was cleared in February by the ethics committee.
\
Citing a study by the Harvard business school, Mr. Iott said that earmarks dampen rather than stimulate the local economy by making it dependent on federal largess.
\
""When you've got a bunch of congressmen fighting over who's going to get the biggest piece of the pie, the taxpayers end up with just the crumbs and they get to pay the bill,"" Mr. Iott said.
\
Mr. Iott has pledged that he won't support earmarks, defined in part as projects that haven't been advocated by the executive branch. He also has vowed to serve no more than three terms, if elected.
\
Mr. Iott said he believes Miss Kaptur's votes for the health-care bill, the $787 billion stimulus, and the ""cap-and-trade"" environmental legislation have put her at odds with a majority of voters in her district.
\
The district encompasses most of Lucas County - including heavily Democrat Toledo, as well as all of Erie and Ottawa counties, and a portion of Lorain County.
\
Two other congressional districts in northwest Ohio have what are expected to be lopsided contests between incumbent Republicans and Democratic challengers.
\
Other area races
\
Rep. Bob Latta (R., Bowling Green) is seeking his second full term representing the 5th Congressional District. The district spans 16 northwest Ohio counties, including Wood and the southwestern portion of Lucas County. Mr. Latta's Democratic opponent is Caleb Finkenbiner of Defiance.
\
In the 4th Congressional District, Republican incumbent Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Urbana) is seeking a third term. Challenging him are Democrat Douglas Litt and Libertarian Donald Kissick.

46,"ZANESVILLE - Business and college officials gathered at Ohio University-Zanesville Monday night to discuss opportunities for the state to be in the forefront of clean energy solutions which create jobs.\During the ""Growing Green Jobs In Ohio"" panel discussion in the Elson Hall auditorium, information about the City of Zanesville's Lightmaster project, weatherization and energy efficiency efforts underway by the Corporation for Ohio Appalachian Development (COAD) and the importance of education in providing a workforce for the green economy was presented.\Mayor Howard Zwelling and officials with J Core, marketer of the Varmatic Lightmaster system, spoke about the cost savings that can be realized, the jobs the technology could create and the positive impact on the environment.\Zwelling said energy saving, saving the environment and creation of an economy based on green jobs was a ""great cause.""\""The Lightmaster, it's something that helps the economy, but also the environment,"" he said, noting that while the city saved about 28 percent on its street light energy usage last year, J Core has also committed to helping bring manufacturing of the Lightmaster product to Zanesville, as soon as this year.\He also said the cost savings also translates into about 71 tons less of pollutants being put into the air due to the efficiency of the Lightmaster.\Tom Calhoun, housing programs manager with COAD, touted the number of jobs that have been created within the last few months as community action agencies gear up to use federal stimulus funds to weatherize 6,000 homes over the next couple of years.\""Everything is linked. What better way to create jobs than by saving the environment,"" Calhoun said.\But it's going to take education to drive the point home, said Jerry Hutton a professor of Energy & Transportation Technologies at Hocking College.\""It's going to take a holistic approach, cutting across technologies. We need to drive this into the elementaries, junior high schools and high schools,"" Hutton said. ""Through STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) programs, we'll be able to retrain people and we're going to be a piece of that.""\Tracy Sabetta, with the National Wildlife Federation, also made comments in support of national energy legislation.\""Clean energy technologies, like wind and solar, will reduce climate change pollution while creating millions of new jobs at home,"" Sabetta said.

Limits on carbon emissions are coming either through legislation or EPA regulation no matter your beliefs on whether global warming is a serious threat, the executive overseeing Duke Energy Corp.'s programs dealing with climate change, renewable energy and environmental technology said this morning .
\
""This is a job for Congress, not bureaucrats,"" said John Stowell, Duke's vice president of environmental, health and safety policy at the opening of the City of Cincinnati's Energy-Economic-Environment Summit at the Duke Energy Center. The half-day event, part of Mayor Mark Mallory's Green Cincinnati Plan, drew about 400 local business and energy officials to discuss green and energy efficiency approaches.
\
Climate change will impose costs on businesses and consumers. For example, Duke expects to replace all of its electric generation facilities, which provides power to 4 million customers in five states, by 2050.
\
Dealing with increases in heat-trapping carbon dioxide in our atmosphere ""is one of the biggest challenges we face environmentally,"" he said. ""Our children and grandchildren may say it's the biggest challenges of all time.""
\
Duke hasn't taken a position on the climate change legislation introduced this week by U.S. Sens. Barbara Boxer and John Kerry, but Stowell said Duke believes any legislation needs certain features.
\
Among them: A cap and trade provision, ""not a carbon tax,"" he said, which caps carbon emissions and puts a market-based price on emissions to encourage innovation and greater efficiency.
\
Stowell said a similar cap and trade scheme has succeeded in reducing acid rain and smog-producing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide since the early 1990s.
\
Also, the legislation needs incentives to develop new technology and carbon offsets, and ""we need to take a look at nuclear.""
\
Duke hopes to hear this month from the federal Department of Energy about a funding request to develop a so-called ""clean energy park"" in Piketon, east of Cincinnati, which could include a new nuclear generating plant in a decade.
\
Developing so-called ""clean coal' technologies such as burying carbon emissions deep under ground also are important because coal provides up to 50 percent of the nation's electricity. A massive switch to competing fuels, mainly natural gas, would dramatically increase the cost of manufacturing on home heating, he said. ""We need to keep coal in the game.""
\
Stowell also said any climate change legislation needs to protect the U.S. manufacturing base.

Willard Mitt Romney these days could not be more explicit about abandoning President Barack Obama's carbon-dioxide restrictions.
\
""Irresponsibly,"" Romney wrote in an Aug. 28 op-ed for the Foster's Daily Democrat in New Hampshire, ""the EPA declared carbon dioxide, the same carbon dioxide that humans exhale, to be a 'pollutant' that poses risks to human health."" He also observed: ""Congress had the good sense not to compound our economic challenges by imposing cap-and-trade's extraordinary costs on the American people.""
\
Romney's website offers this carbon-friendly promise: ""Mitt Romney will eliminate the regulations promulgated in pursuit of the Obama administration's costly and ineffective anti-carbon agenda.""
\
Well -- surprise, surprise! Unlike this conservative aria, Romney sang a totally different tune as Massachusetts' liberal-Republican governor.
\
A recently exposed, online dossier from the 2008 John McCain campaign offers 200 pages of Romney's self-contradictions, vacillations, and head scratchers. His views on so-called ""global warming"" are just the tip of this non-melting iceberg of confusion.
\
McCain's database includes Ryan Sager's April 20, 2007, New York Sun story in which Romney embraces a 1940s fuel source. ""Liquefied coal, gosh,"" Romney said. ""Hitler during the Second World War - I guess because he was concerned about losing his oil - liquefied coal. That technology is still there.""
\
Less bizarre, according March 25, 2007's Los Angeles Times, Romney told religious leaders in 2003 that he was ""terrified"" about ""warming"" and found it ""quite alarming.""
\
From one RINO to another, Romney wrote then-Governor George Elmer Pataki (Republican in Name Only - New York) in July 2003. ""Now is the time to take action toward climate protection,"" Romney declared. He advocated a ""regional cap and trade system"" for both states.
\
In 2004, Romney launched the Massachusetts Climate Protection Plan, ""a coordinated statewide response to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect the climate,"" as his office described it.
\
Romney's Dec. 7, 2005, press release announced that ""strict state limitations on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power plants take effect on Jan. 1, 2006.""
\
""These carbon emission limits will provide real and immediate progress in the battle to improve our environment,"" Romney said. This red tape, the communiqué noted, is designed to lower emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and mercury from power plant smokestacks."" Furthermore, the experts whom Romney consulted ""include John Holden [sic]...at Harvard University.""
\
""Romney (or his staff) was misled by John 'Holden' [sic], a rabid environmentalist and collaborator of the notorious Paul Ehrlich. John Holdren is now Obama's science adviser,"" says Dr. S. Fred Singer, Ph.D., a University of Virginia professor emeritus of physics and environmental science and the U.S. Weather Satellite Service's founding director. ""They consider CO2 a pollutant and mention it along with sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury -- all real pollutants, injurious to human health. Clearly, they had no clue about the science.""
\
""No one would choose such a green course, enlist such advisors, and then suddenly reverse himself,"" the Cato Institute's Dr. Patrick Michaels, Ph.D., tells me. ""As president, Romney will revert to his more familiar green self.""
\
""Romney's press release should be compared to more recent statements in which he has changed his views on climate change,"" suggests the Reason Foundation's Julian Morris. ""The optimistic conclusion would be that he changes his mind in response to better evidence. The pessimistic conclusion would be that he changes his mind in response to the advice of pollsters.""
\
Americans who thirst for leadership driven by principles rather than polls should go see The Iron Lady. Meryl Streep, the finest actress in recorded history, masterfully portrays former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Her Majesty's head of government dominates the United Kingdom, steady in her conservative convictions and convincing as she communicates them. As America drifts among the waves like a faded champagne cork, these memories of Thatcher's rule trigger goose bumps.
\
America now ponders someone who is flexible on virtually everything -- even the air we breathe. Clearly no Iron Lady, Romney is the Man of Foil.

Mr. President, do you realize how ridiculous this sounds with all the massive bills and controls that you and this Congress are throwing at the American people? They are so bulky and confusing that members do not even read them before they are passed.

52,"Families enjoy Heritage Days \The Fairborn Heritage Days was well attended this summer. \From the opening ceremony, hosted by Dr. Mike Horton and about a dozen other costumed Fairborn Heritage members, to the fly-over by the Wright B aircraft, to displays and activities at the Mercer-Smith House, and the special displays and eating opportunities in our downtown, the event validated Fairborn's motto of ""Tradition and Innovation."" \Some of the highlights for us were the walking tour of the Mercer-Smith Gardens by Master Gardener Bill Power, the dulcimer concert inside the historic Mercer-Smith House, a great lunch at Julie Jenschke's Chantilly Cream, and a working display of wooden bowl making at the Cedar Chest. \If you were not able to attend this year, we recommend you keep this enjoyable and educational opportunity for your family in mind for next year. \Betsy and Laurel Mayer \Fairborn \Cap-and-trade is bad for Ohio and nation \The U.S. House of Representatives just passed the ill-conceived cap-and-trade bill. The bill would set a limit, or cap, on carbon emissions from fossil-fuel use in an attempt to reduce greenhouse gasses and stop global warming. There are four major reasons why this is a bad bill: \- The bill is based on the premise that man-made global warming is a fact. This is not the case; there are hundreds of climatologists around the globe who do not think the Earth is warming. Of the ones that do, many do not believe it is caused by man, but by natural events such as an increase in solar flare activity. So this bill is designed to solve a problem that may not even exist. \- This bill will drive energy costs through the roof. \- This bill will cost thousands of American jobs. Higher energy costs will force manufacturers to move jobs overseas in order to stay cost-competitive in a global economy. \- This bill will raise taxes for most Americans. One thing the supporters of this bill don't want you to know is that the bill provides provisions for direct payments to be made to lower-income families to offset higher energy costs. By including this provision, the writer's of the bill acknowledge it will cause energy prices to rise sharply. Who do you think is going to pay for this? \This bill is bad for Ohio and bad for America. I urge Ohio Sens. Sherrod Brown and George Voinovich to vote against this bill when it reaches the Senate. \David J. Corr \Centerville \'Polluters' fueled rise of middle class \Re ""Hey, GOP: This is the wrong time to be anti-green,"" July 4: Why must we be continually badgered by lecturing do-nothings on the matter of climate change and carbon emissions? Thomas Friedman's column is more short-sighted blather on the topic. \My main complaint is his backslap to ""polluters."" In previous generations, we would call these people ""industrialists"" or, in other words, ""job providers."" They built an industry that provided solid jobs, white-collar and blue-collar alike. \This fueled the growth of a middle class that provided stability for the nation. \Things have changed. Much of the major industry has left this country. Replacing those good, middle-class jobs are treasury-sapping government handouts and bailouts. At least unemployed people don't emit carbon -- maybe that's the point? \Friedman fails to explain why global warming, the left-wing pet cause of the '90s, fell into disfavor. Are the global climatologists now in bed with the same ""scientists"" that sold us short on the previous climate scare? \I'm all in favor of being a good steward of our environment. However, too many who claim that they are greenies merely hop from one lavish, wasteful photo op to another in their limousines and private jets. \Richard G. Docken Jr. \Beavercreek"

Forget the tree-shaped toilet plungers and eco-friendly cat scratchers.
\
The oddest Earth Day product this year is President Bush's plan to address global warming.
\
Announced Wednesday, it calls for 17 more years of sluggishness. Mr. Bush set 2025 as his ""national goal"" for turning the corner on greenhouse gases - the first time he's committed himself to a date, however meaningless it is.
\
Predictably, his ideas were greeted by a mix of cheers and jeers.
\
In his speech, posted on whitehouse.gov, Mr. Bush made a passing reference to a meeting in Paris in which world leaders had a brainstorming session about global warming - a warm-up, if you will, for a bigger climate confab in July.
\
Uh-huh.
\
I'm sure the announcement had nothing to do with an unpopular, lame duck President trying to create some buzz for his party's nominee to succeed him, Republican John McCain, just as Americans were gearing up for yet another odd assortment of Earth Day events at shopping malls and nature preserves.
\
Oh, and let's not forget the Pennsylvania primary is Tuesday, the same day Earth Day falls this year.
\
I'm sure the announcement had nothing to do with trying to keep Democrats divided over Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
\
Naw.
\
I'm glad Mr. Bush weighed in, even with token rhetoric. It speaks more about the power of this issue than his presidency.
\
Does anyone honestly believe he'll set the agenda for future generations? Of course not. Even utilities expect a cap-and-trade system or a tax on carbon emissions from the next Congress. Mr. Bush is now a little kid playing on a ball diamond until the grown-ups arrive and set up their gear.
\
Near the end of the 2004 presidential campaign, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency brass - on orders from the White House, I'm told - fought hard at the Society of Environmental Journalists national conference in Pittsburgh to dispel the belief that Mr. Bush was indifferent to climate change.
\
With two weeks to go and the race against Democratic challenger John Kerry still too close to call, one federal EPA speaker after another hammered out the theme that Mr. Bush - like Mr. Kerry - accepted the science behind human-induced changes to the Earth's climate. They said the two simply differed over the Kyoto Protocol because of its potential impact on the U.S. economy.
\
That made me think back how far global warming had come in a short time. Just a few years earlier, Mr. Bush's father had mocked Al Gore for his views.
\
The current president found global warming politically expedient to acknowledge as an issue in the 2004 election. In 2008, he finds it a must-do policy initiative (or appearance thereof).
\
Which brings us to Mr. McCain. He is co-sponsor of the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act of 2007. So is Democrat-turned-Independent Joe Lieberman, the Connecticut senator who would have been vice president if things had turned out differently for Mr. Gore in the 2000 election.
\
Mr. Obama and Ms. Clinton signed on to that bill, one of several proposals for a carbon cap-and-trade system. It has been mired in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
\
A stronger bill Mr. Lieberman sponsored with Republican Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the Climate Security Act of 2007, was endorsed by an 11-8 vote in December, the first major piece of climate legislation to make it through that committee.
\
The two senators said Wednesday they were pleased to see Mr. Bush come on board with the concept of addressing climate change. They said they hope to get a vote on their bill in the full Senate this summer.

What's the rush to pass the plan
\
Editor:
\
There are many questions worth debating before this country possibly launches a national health care program, yet the president says it has to be in place by the end of the year.
\
Only six months before we possibly alter the nation dramatically? Doesn't it take at least six months these days for young people to research colleges and make applications? Doesn't it take at least six month to start up a business -- or remodel a house?
\
First, the cost. We're told the first 10 years may or may not cost a trillion dollars. Well, what of the next 10 years, and then the next? Maybe our young president doesn't realize how quickly a decade slips by.
\
Will the federal government look to the states to share the cost burden? Will immigrants of green-card status, or illegal immigrants and/or their children, be covered?
\
This administration seems to be now showing favoritism to unions. Will there be a rush to unionize the entire medical field? And then, won't it be hard to dismiss an incompetent employee? (Are the personnel competent, I may be wondering some day as I get my tonsils out.)
\
If government-backed unions get situated, then how hard will it be to make an innovation in a medical procedure -- if such a change might eliminate a job? And if the government and unions come to dominate the medical field, will they insist that every item used, every cotton ball, be made in America? That would add to expenses.
\
There are so very many questions; we should have time to debate.

Legislators should vote no on budget
\
Editor:
\
Charlotte Iserbyt is an authority on education, and from info I have learned from her and others, I realize why in Ohio Gov. Strickland, a democrat, has come up with his decision to change the way our children are taught in schools. It is a one world agenda, and hopefully will be stopped if you call and tell your legislator to vote no on Strickland's budget, which includes this practice.
\
From Charlotte Thomson Iserbyt, former senior policy adviser, U.S. Department of Education (check out her Web site at: http://www.deliberatedumbingdown.com).
\
P.S. Many years ago I had in my possession a document (minutes of a meeting of high-up communists) that discussed how to get Americans to accept world government. The consensus was the only way to do so was to choose an issue both conservatives and liberals will accept as important.
\
The choice was ""the environment."" Very good decision on their part. I have lost few documents in the past 30 years and that one was most unfortunately one of them.
\
This falls in line with legislation passed through the House, H.R. 2454 The Cap and Trade bill. Please call your senators and tell them they must vote no on this horrible legislation.
\
Also tell them to vote no on the Socialized Health Care Bill. No on S-909 Thought Crime bill. Below is some of the Obama administration plan to destroy American with H.R. 2454, Climate Bill, Cap and Trade.
\
Destroys 1-3 million U.S. jobs each year.
\
Will raise gasoline prices by 74 percent.
\
Will raise natural gas prices by 55 percent.
\
Will raise an average family's energy bill by $1,600 annually.
\
Will increase the federal debt by 26 percent, which is $29,150 per person.
\
State legislators must understand this bill stomps on the states' and individual rights. If passed, before you can sell your home, the federal government will inspect your home for green adaptable window, doors, insulation, etc., everything must be brought up to their green codes before you can sell.

ORRVILLE -- Though technically not a debate, it was clear who the winner of Tuesday's Candidates' Night forum was: The League of Women Voters of Wayne County.
\
The non-partisan group, along with the AAUW and University of Akron Wayne College, organized the event which included candidates running for Ohio's 16th Congressional District, Wayne County commissioner and the Ninth District Court of Appeals in Akron.
\
David Broehl, chairman of the Wayne County Democratic Party, and John Hall, vice chairman of the Wayne County Republican Party, both praised the efforts of the League to allow an opportunity for voters to hear from the candidates. Cindy Biggs served as moderator.
\
""I am proud of Wayne County for having two excellent debates with excellent questions,"" Broehl said, referring also to an earlier one organized by a political action committee of the Wooster Area Chamber of Commerce.
\
The format allowed candidates to give one-minute answers and after everyone spoke, additional time was granted to further expand or clarify comments.
\
""I appreciate the League of Women Voters for putting this on,"" Hall said, adding he liked the format which allowed for further discussion on a particular question.
\
Biggs gave the candidates latitude with the additional comments and only cut off debate a couple of times, once after a lengthy discussion on cap-and-trade and the other was to allow a member of the audience to ask one last question as the debate's time limit drew close.
\
The questions to the Congressional candidates covered similar territory of other debates, said Jim Smail, chairman of the Wayne County GOP. The only new wrinkle was write-in candidate Dr. Bob Ross.
\
It was the first time Wayne County voters had the opportunity to hear from Ross in a public forum. Joining him were incumbent John Boccieri, an Alliance Democrat, Jim Renacci, a Wadsworth Republican, and Jeffrey Blevins, a Wadsworth Libertarian.
\
The first question the candidates tackled was what changes in the tax code would they suggest in order to help out citizens and help the country improve the economy.
\
Blevins said before making any changes in the tax code, the spending habits in Congress needs to be changed. Once spending is under control, then he would see what changes were needed in how to subsidize government operations.
\
Any changes in the tax code need to be fair for all Americans, not just certain segments of the population, Blevins said, adding a national sales tax might be something to explore.
\
Boccieri said Congress has already implement targeted tax cuts for small businesses and families and has worked to help stimulate jobs and the economy. One of the tax code changes he supports is to close loopholes that permitted large corporations to ship jobs overseas and receive tax breaks.
\
Renacci told the group he was a certified public accountant and knows the tax code is extremely complicated. He has encountered IRS agents who don't know all of the complexities of the code. Renacci said the tax code and tax forms need to be simplified, and the result should be a net lowering of taxes on corporations and individuals.
\
A lower tax burden on corporations will allow them to hire again, he said.
\
Ross described himself as a ""none of the above""-type candidate who is interested in how tax changes affect local constituents. He was more concerned about implementing a comprehensive development plan that would include tax, economic development and environmental policies.
\
The candidates also addressed health care reform, cap-and-trade legislation and agriculture.
\
The League of Women Voters event was also the first time the two candidates for commissioner addressed voters in a public format.
\
Incumbent Ann Obrecht, a Republican seeking a third term, is facing a write-in challenger, Charles Grassman. They, too, were asked about taxes.
\
Dan Flory asked if they would support a tax increase or decreasing salaries in order to deal with the current financial climate.
\
Obrecht said the county has reduced expenditures, and with this economy, now was not the time to increase taxes.
\
She said the cuts made by county elected officials and employees have been successful in stabilizing the general fund. She would look at different ways to streamline and combine functions in order to make government more efficient.
\
Grassman said raising taxes now would not be the best course of action. He agreed with Obrecht that the county needed to find ways to combine responsibilities. He does not know if laying off any more people is the answer.
\
Alex Davis, president of the League of Women Voters, said she was initially concerned the Congressional debate would be about Boccieri and Renacci and not the issues, and she was glad to see the issues came out.
\
""It will be an interesting race,"" she said.
\
The League's board also discussed at length whether to include the two write-in candidates, and in the end decided to in order to demonstrate to the community the group is non-partisan and to give everyone an opportunity to address the issues.
\
Following the debate, Jean Mohr, former chairwoman of the Wayne County Democratic Party, said the debate was very well run and some good ideas were brought forward. She particularly appreciated some of the comments from Boccieri and Ross about the environment.
\
""All-in-all, everyone did a great job, and it is now up to voters to decide if they want to stay with the current administration or vote for a change in direction,"" Hall said.
\
Smail said based on the questions submitted in written form and asked by the audience, he got the sense people are wanting to make a change.
\
""I think citizens had a chance to make evaluations of the candidates, and let the best person win,"" Broehl said.

57,"As the nation decides which party will control the Senate this November, the race in Kentucky stands out for one big reason: Mitch McConnell.\Loathed by Democrats across the country as a cynical power broker but praised by Republicans as a shrewd political tactician, the GOP's longest-serving Senate majority leader is being challenged by a well-funded retired Marine lieutenant colonel and fighter pilot who flew in 89 combat missions, including bombings of al-Qaeda and the Taliban.\Though climate change likely won't be a key voting issue in the race, the candidates have approaches toward global warming in a state with a historic — but drastically shrinking — dependence on mining coal, a leading contributor to climate change.\Kentucky coal production in the second quarter of 2020 was down 83% from the same period a decade earlier. Coal mining jobs dropped from 17,111 to 3,760.\In Kentucky, temperatures are already rising. Growing seasons are changing, and there are concerns that heavier rains are causing more flooding.\Scientists have warned that it will get worse down the road, with decreasing crop yields and dangerous landslides on strip-mined mountain landscapes.\McGrath has been frank in identifying the threats posed by global warming. McConnell, for his part, has moderated his past statements: He now acknowledges that human-caused climate change exists.\For years, McConnell would not accept climate science, telling journalists that he did not know whether humans burning fossil fuels was contributing to global warming.\""I'm not a scientist,"" he would say, adding that his priority was Kentucky coal communities, even though their economic decline accelerated under his watch and some critics have said he should have done more to transition away from coal.\Still, McConnell has sent millions of dollars to the state's coal-mining counties over the years, and he has promised to stay ""committed to helping coal communities plan for the future with training and employment services as well as economic development,"" according to a statement his office provided in response to an interview request.\He opposed the global Paris climate agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions — a campaign spokeswoman called it ""disastrous"" — while McGrath thinks the Trump administration should not have withdrawn from the accord.\McConnell also is against the Green New Deal, the Congressional resolution backed by some Democrats — though not McGrath — that proposes a massive shift in federal spending to create jobs and hasten a transition to clean energy by 2050.\In March 2019, in discussing a ""show vote"" — engineered as a political trap for Democrats — on his own version of the Green New Deal, McConnell told reporters he believed in human-caused climate change.\""I do,"" the six-term Kentucky senator said. ""The question is, how do you address it? The way to do this consistent with American values and American capitalism is through technology and innovation. And there is no question that is the way to get results, not to shut down your economy, throw people out of work, make people reconstruct their homes, get out of their cars ... this is nonsense.""\McConnell tends to play defense on climate change.\He has not put forward his own climate plan, nor have Republicans in the Senate under his leadership.\After the House of Representatives passed cap-and-trade legislation in 2009, McConnell referred to the bill as the national energy tax and said he was glad to see its demise in the Senate, which did not put it up for a vote.\Now, McConnell is touting his support for carbon capture and storage — a technology embraced by many Republicans as a way to keep burning coal in a carbon-constrained world — and for budgets that include energy efficiency.\He favors, he says, ""common sense and actually attainable solutions to protect our environment.""\The League of Conservation Voters gives McConnell a 14% 2019 score and a 7% lifetime score for his votes on environmental legislation.\McConnell has defended his overall environmental record, mentioning his funding of local conservation efforts in Kentucky and his backing of this year's bipartisan Great American Outdoor Act.\The act, signed into law by President Donald Trump, provides $900 million in annual funding for public land protection and up to $1.9 billion a year for five years to fund a maintenance backlog at national parks, forests and wildlife refuges.\Both McConnell and McGrath have shown an ability to raise large amounts of money, with McGrath surprisingly in the lead as of the end of June, tapping into the pool of political contributors who want to see McConnell retired.\In an interview, McGrath spoke more forcefully about climate change than is typical for a major party nominee in Kentucky.\She said she sees climate change through the lens of her military training,\""This is a national security issue,"" she said. ""This is an international security issue.""\She added, ""We are already seeing weather patterns like we have never seen before. Wildfires we've never seen, desertification. We are going to see mass migrations.""\Low-lying military bases are being flooded from sea level rise, McGrath said. ""We have to plan for this. McConnell does not have a plan.""\When asked at a campaign stop in Louisville this summer what her plan for global warming would be, McGrath signaled support for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's climate plan, giving it a tentative endorsement.\""There's a lot of what I have seen about it that is good,"" she said, adding that she understands it to be an aggressive proposal.\Biden in July announced a $2 trillion clean economy jobs program he calls ""Build Back Better,"" with jobs-creation and environmental justice as its pillars. Biden also wants Congress to pass emissions limits with ""an enforcement mechanism ... based on the principles that polluters must bear the full cost of the carbon pollution they are emitting.""\McGrath said putting a price on carbon appears to be an effective tool to combat climate change and has bipartisan appeal, but she said she would want to make sure it didn't hurt ""middle-class and working-class families.""\She likes the jobs and infrastructure aspects of Biden's plan, she said, but believes that coal is still essential and Biden should focus more on helping fossil-fuel dependent communities make an economic transition.\""We have a debt to pay to our coal communities, and legislation needs to account for that directly,"" McGrath said.\Talking about climate change from the perspective of military experience is a new approach for a politician in Kentucky, a state that has a history of supporting candidates who are sympathetic to coal, even outside of Kentucky's coalfields, said D. Stephen Voss, associate professor of political science at the University of Kentucky.\One example, he said, is how U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, R-Lexington, made former Democratic Congressman Ben Chandler pay a price in 2012 for his 2009 vote for the cap-and-trade bill.\Barr's campaign was able to paint Chandler, who served four terms representing the state's second-largest city and the horse country surrounding it, as anti-coal.\""What Amy McGrath is doing with environmental policy fits with how she handles many of the issues that bring down Democrats in a state like Kentucky,"" Voss said. ""She has been willing to offer a fairly typical Democratic Party issue platform, but she is experimenting with defending it and promoting it using language and attitudes that are more comfortable and familiar with places that tend to vote more Republican.""\Whether it will work, Voss said, he's not predicting. But he does not believe climate policy will play much of a role, if any, in the outcome of the McConnell-McGrath race.\It is not an issue that moves the people in the middle of the political spectrum who are so important to the outcome, he said.\A handful of polls have shown the race to be tight, according to FiveThirtyEight.\Environmental advocates had put their hopes behind state Rep. Charles Booker, a progressive whose ""hood to holler"" message had sought to connect the needs of voters in Black neighborhoods in Louisville with rural Appalachian voters, and whose surging Democratic primary campaign against McGrath came up short by 3 percentage points.\Some also felt resentful that McGrath, the moderate, was given a big advantage by the support of national Democrats early on.\""We built a movement across the state in support of a Green New Deal with the most progressive candidate Kentucky has ever seen,"" said Lily Gardner, a high school senior in Lexington who is active with the Sunrise Movement. ""We are left with a Democratic candidate who is completely unwilling to champion the solutions to the climate crisis that both science, and perhaps more importantly, justice demand.""\She said the youth climate movement will work to get out the vote this fall and support progressive candidates for local elections, but ""in no way will we be publicly endorsing McGrath or supporting her unless she makes a radical left turn.""\Despite McGrath's clear recognition of the problems of climate change — in stark contrast to McConnell — ""no one is fired up or excited,"" about her, said Wallace McMullen, a longtime clean energy and environmental advocate from Louisville, who is a Sierra Club leader in the state.\McGrath has not been endorsed by the Sierra Club in Kentucky, but she has also kept her distance from the group, said McMullen and Tom Morris, who chairs the Kentucky chapter's political committee.\""The sad fact is that sometimes statewide candidates don't want our endorsement in Kentucky,"" Morris said. ""We have not been able to get a response from her.""\As an alternative, the state chapter has issued a nonendorsement, of sorts, against McConnell.\""It basically says vote for anybody but Mitch,"" Morris said.\Morris, of Bowling Green, said he plans to vote for McGrath. He said he's pleased she recognizes that climate change is a problem and he was equally pleased to hear she has said good things about Biden's climate plans.\""McConnell's record speaks for itself,"" he added. ""He has blocked any kind of meaningful climate legislation. He supports Donald Trump and enabled Donald Trump, and that in itself has been sufficient reason to oppose him.""\McConnell is not popular in Kentucky, but Kentucky voters have shown repeatedly they prefer his clout to whatever competition he might have.\He has been favored in a state that hasn't voted for a Democratic president since the election of Bill Clinton 24 years ago and that gave Trump a 30-point victory in 2016.\One or two election cycles ago, a candidate with McGrath's understanding of the climate crisis would have been enough to elate the state's environmental community. That some are now saying ""meh"" is an indication of the growing sense of urgency among climate voters and represents a threat to her campaign.\Money is an equalizing influence in politics, and McGrath has been able to raise a lot of it. As more Republicans nationally endorse Biden amid questions about Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and his character, there is a chance this could turn into a wave election against the president.\If that happens, all bets are off.\At a glance\Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who led the congressional resistance to what he's called ""President Obama's war on coal,"" has been in lockstep with the Trump administration's agenda to promote fossil fuels and relax environmental regulations.\Amy McGrath, a retired Marine fighter pilot and McConnell's challenger in November, views climate change through the lens of her military background, seeing it much as the Pentagon does, as a national and international security threat. She likes the Biden climate plan, the most aggressive put forward by any Democratic or Republican Party presidential nominee in history, but says she still has questions about it.\McGrath has raised tens of millions of dollars, giving her an opportunity to compete against McConnell, who has also raised tens of millions of dollars.\Amy McGrath plans to take on US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in 2020.\Courier Journal"

Half of that would have to come from renewable resources. Since coal-fired power plants provide about 90 percent of Ohio's electricity, the state will need to develop alternative sources in a hurry to meet the governor's timetable. \Here is a look at what could be in the mix: Fuel Cells \WHAT ARE THEY?: \An energy conversion device that uses a chemical reaction instead of combustion to generate electricity. In electrolysis, an electric current applied to water produces hydrogen and oxygen. By reversing it, hydrogen and oxygen are combined in a fuel cell to generate water and electricity. \OHIO CONNECTION: Since 2005, a number of companies have announced fuel cell investments in Ohio. Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems named Canton as its North American fuel cells headquarters, GrafTech International moved its corporate headquarters to Parma, HydroGen Corp. moved its headquarters to Cleveland, Ashlawn Group established fuel cell operations in Painesville, ECD Ovonics established its Ovonic Hydrogen Systems in Akron, and California-based UltraCell Corp. opened a manufacturing facility in Dayton. Since 2002, the state of Ohio has earmarked more than $100 million in economic development funds for the fuel cell initiative. \PROS: Their only by-product is water, making them an ideal way to eliminate tailpipe or smokestack emissions . Fuel cell makers have more than 30 products on the market today. \CONS: They're new, costly and in early development so they aren't widely available. Fuel cell-powered cars would require new infrastructure of hydrogen filling stations across the nation. \POTENTIAL: A fuel cell the size of a truck placed next to the building could be used to power an entire high rise; smaller portable fuel cells could be used in cell phone chargers, radios, and laptops; fuel cells will last much longer than batteries. \Nuclear \WHAT IS IT? Nuclear fission is used inside a nuclear reactor to produce heat to then drive a steam turbine in electricity generation. The use of nuclear fission to release heat which is then used to drive turbines. \OHIO CONNECTION: Ohio has two nuclear power plants -- Davis-Bessie near Toledo and Perry east of Cleveland. Two other nuclear plants were canceled in the 1980s. \PROS: It provides reliable base-load power. There are no air emissions. The plants are less costly to operate than coal-fired plants. \CONS: Nuclear plants are so expensive, unpopular and heavily regulated that there hasn't been any new requests for certificates for reactors in decades. And while industry advocates tout new safety claims, failures can be catastrophic. A meltdown at the Davis-Bessie plant was narrowly averted in 2002 when an inspection revealed serious corrosion in the reactor head. There are storage issues as well, since radioactive waste also must be stored for centuries. And there are concerns about the plants being the target of terrorist attacks. \POTENTIAL: Ohio could see new nuclear plants being built by large utilities in the next 15 years or so as the demand for electricity continues to increase. Now that global warming is recognized as a legitimate threat, lawmakers, governors and Congress are looking at ways to reduce greenhouse gases, particularly carbon emissions from cars and coal-burning power plants. \BioMass \WHAT IS IT?: Burning biomass feedstocks, such as crops, sewage sludge, landfill methane or other byproducts, to generate electricity or make fuel for transportation. \OHIO CONNECTION: Methane gas plants -- capturing methane gas from landfills, animal farms, sewage plants or other sources -- are operating in Columbus, Port Clinton and Lorain County, generating as much as 18 megawatts of power. \PROS: Growing fuel sources or using by-products could reduce greenhouse gasses, air pollution and landfill wastes. It could also stimulate the economy. \CONS: It can be difficult to get a consistent supply of these fuels. There is some debate about how growing fuel will impact the cost of food. \POTENTIAL: An October 2004 study from Ohio State University said Ohio has enough biomass resources to generate 84.9 billion kilowatt hours of power a year. Ohio's lack of ethanol plants will soon end when seven facilities open in the next six months. Wind \WHAT IS IT?: Turbines convert wind into electricity and put the power directly onto the electric grid. \OHIO CONNECTION: \AMP Ohio runs a four turbine-wind farm in Wood County on behalf of 10 member communities. It can generate up to 7.2 megawatts -- one megawatt is enough to power 300 homes. Currently it's Ohio's only commercial wind farm. Plans are underway to expand the Wood County farm and put up turbines in Logan and Champaign counties. \PROS: It's clean and has no by-products. \CONS: If there is no wind, there is no power since electricity cannot be stored without huge batteries. Some people don't like the aesthetics and animal rights activists have complained because of birds and bats getting caught in the turbine blades. \POTENTIAL: Wind maps show strong, consistent wind on Lake Erie and in northwest Ohio. Wind proponents say 3,000 wind turbines could be placed offshore in Lake Erie to generate enough power for the entire state. Another study says 66,000 megawatts could be generated off of 2,600 100-meter turbines placed on Ohio's windiest land. \Solar: \WHAT IS IT?: Photovoltaic systems convert energy from the sun into electricity. PV devices are used to light homes, operate calculators and road signs, and power satellites. Some systems are hooked up to send electricity out on the power grid. Solar thermal systems use sun energy to heat air or water for buildings. \OHIO CONNECTION: Ohioans use small amounts of solar power at more than 50 schools and in about 1,000 homes. The state's biggest solar array -- a 1-megawatt system -- is planned for the Ohio Air National Guard's 180th Fighter Wing at Toledo Express Airport. On the production side, First Solar in Perrysburg manufactures PV systems but exports most of them to Germany. \PROS: It's clean and has no by-products. Plus, the sun provides a free source of fuel. \CONS: If it isn't sunny, there is little or no power. It is more costly than wind power. \POTENTIAL: If solar panels covered one half of one percent of Ohio, photovoltaic systems could supply Ohio's annual residential electricity needs. More realistic than a solar farm would be solar garden plots -- small systems on rooftops and buildings across the state. \Clean Coal \WHAT IS IT? New technologies seek to remove emissions before coal is used. Gasification breaks down coal into its basic chemical parts \by exposing it to carefully controlled amounts of oxygen under high temperature and pressure. Carbon molecules break apart, setting off chemical reactions that produce carbon monoxide, hydrogen and other gas compounds that can be burned. Sequestration captures the carbon dioxide before coal is burned, turns it into a liquid form and injects it 9,000 feet below ground. \OHIO CONNECTION: Columbus-based American Electric Power is planning a $1 billion electric plant in Miegs County that will use gasification and could do sequestration. The Ohio Coal Development Office has invested more than $175 million in researching and developing clean coal technology. \PROS: More Ohio coal could be used because its high sulphur content would be moot -- sulphur and other products would be removed before using the coal. It could reduce air emissions. With gasification, coal gases are fired in a gas turbine to generate electricity and hot exhaust is also used to generate steam for more generation so it's overall a more efficient use of coal. \CONS: The technology is unproven and relies on a fossil fuel that must be mined. Converting carbon into a liquid takes an enormous amount of power -- as much as 30 percent of an electric plant's output. It's unclear whether existing plants could be retrofitted for clean coal technology. More geological information is needed to determine how fast the liquid could be injected. \POTENTIAL: Ohio has huge reserves of high-sulphur content coal, 21 coal-burning power plants, and 2,300 coal miners. The holy grail of the coal industry is to find a way to keep using coal without all the nasty environmental drawbacks. \Hydro \WHAT IS IT? Flowing water turns a turbine, which runs a generator. \OHIO CONNECTION: \Ohio has low-impact hydro projects along the Ohio River and smaller systems scattered across the state, such as at the O'Shaughnessy Dam in Columbus or at the city of Bryan in Williams County. \PROS: No air pollution and a relatively low-cost fuel production. It uses a well-established technology and provides consistent base-load power using water for fuel. \CONS: It's costly at the front-end and there are some objections to dam locations and some concerns about their impact on fish. \POTENTIAL: AMP Ohio, a group of municipally owned electric companies, is planning five new low-impact hydro projects on the Ohio River to generate more than 240 megawatts of electricity. \SALINEVILLE -- Coal miner John Beadnell crawls on his hands and knees into the cushioned seat of a $1 million mining machine 170 feet below the surface of the hills of Jefferson County. \The ground rumbles when the 51-year-old foreman fires up the continuous miner and his co-workers start a series of conveyor belts. Noise roars through the tunnels that had been hushed only moments earlier. \Beadnell's callused hands dance over 13 levers and knobs as he inches the 35-footlong machine forward while two 4-foot augers at the front spin in opposite directions, chewing into the wall. \Coal spews out the back of the machine, dumps onto a conveyor behind Beadnell and then onto a 2,000-foot-long belt system that whisks it to the earth's surface. \The black gold that Beadnell and his crew dig out of the hills all day and into the night fuels the state's economy. Three billion tons of Ohio coal mined over 200 years helped make the state an industrial powerhouse. \And to this day, every household, retail shop, office tower and manufacturing plant relies on coal: 90 percent of Ohio's electricity comes from coal-fired power plants, compared with 50 percent nationally. \Coal miners have a bumper sticker: ""Everything begins with coal."" \But that could be about to change. \Climate change is now generally accepted as fact: The world is warming, and most believe emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from human activity plays a major role. \Lawmakers, governors and Congress are looking at ways to reduce greenhouse gases, limit dependence on foreign oil, and protect the environment and economy in the long run. \Coal -- though cheap -- contributes to global warming. Any environmental regulations are bound to increase the cost of coal and make other fuel sources more price competitive with coal. \Congress is debating more than nine bills dealing with either taxing carbon or instituting a carbon cap-and-trade program. Both approaches are designed to use financial incentives to limit carbon emissions. \This year is the first time there's been serious debate on carbon emissions with more than 100 hearings held on climate change since January -- compared with fewer than 50 hearings in the prior 10 years, according to the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. \States are also taking their own steps: promoting lowcarbon electricity, launching regional cap-and-trade systems and emphasizing energy efficiency. More than two-dozen states have alternative energy standards that call for generating a certain percentage of the state's electricity from renewable resources. \Ohio is about to join the club. Gov. Ted Strickland is pushing a plan in the General Assembly requiring that 25 percent of Ohio's electricity come from alternative sources by 2025. Half of that would have to come from renewable sources, such as wind, water or solar. \The governor said Ohio needs an assortment of energy -- renewables, nuclear plants, and coal. Failing to diversify Ohio's energy portfolio could have dire consequences, Strickland warns. \""Ohio will be perceived as a status quo state,"" he said. ""We will have lost the opportunity to create new industries and new jobs, and we will have seriously damaged Ohio's future. I think we've already lost potential investment and jobs for not having an energy standard."" \Currently, less than 1 percent of Ohio's electric power comes from renewable resources. \U.S. Rep. David Hobson, RSpringfield, is adamant about the need to address global warming immediately. In May, Hobson accompanied House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic lawmakers to Greenland as part of a factfinding trip to Europe. Seeing boats traveling through a harbor that is normally covered with ice made an impression on the Republican congressman. \""This is a problem for the day, and it's an even bigger problem for the future,"" Hobson said. ""We should not leave it to the future to solve. We need to start down this path."" \It's difficult to put a price tag on Strickland's plan or the bills in Congress. Much will depend on details of the new regulations and on what technological improvements are made and how widely deployed wind turbines, solar arrays and ""clean coal"" systems become. \Clean coal is being counted on to preserve Ohio's coal industry -- a way to use the state's reserves without polluting. \""I think the coal industry is a must. I really do. If we're going to stay competitive with these other countries,"" said coal miner Beadnell. \""There's always better ways to clean the emissions. They ought to be looking at ways to clean it up better and still utilize the fuel that we have."" \Over the past two decades, Ohio has invested more than $175 million in trying to make coal cleaner. \Environmentalists call clean coal an oxymoron and an unproven technology. They would prefer public policy geared toward helping renewables get a foothold, rather than boosting the coal industry. \A study unveiled at a national solar conference in Cleveland in July showed Ohio has 500,000 direct and indirect jobs tied to the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries. \The study predicted 1.2 million jobs in those sectors by 2030 if public policy changes were embraced. \Strickland cited a study in his energy policy speech that said 20,000 new manufacturing jobs would be created if Ohio expanded its use of renewables. \Strickland grew up in coal country and made visiting coal mines at shift change on election days a personal tradition. While he promotes diversifying Ohio's energy mix, he isn't giving up on coal. \""In my judgment, coal is and will remain for decades to come the primary fuel for meeting our energy needs,"" Strickland said. ""I embrace that. It's a fact of life."""
59,"WASHINGTON -- The Senate hearing was supposed to be about manufacturers dealing with the credit crisis, but Sen. Evan Bayh couldn't resist: When it was his turn to question a witness from the United Steelworkers, he asked about a controversial proposal aimed at curbing global warming. \The Indiana Democrat worried that current proposals could encourage companies to move U.S. factories overseas, where they could continue to pollute without facing the financial burden a cap and trade program could create. \""This is not an optimal solution,"" he said. \Bayh's concerns mirror those of his fellow industrial state Democrats. As the U.S. House of Representatives gets closer to passing a bill that would cap levels of greenhouse gas emissions and give industries an allowance for how much they can emit, Democrats from industrial states and states reliant on coal-fired power plants find themselves stuck between environmental groups that have traditionally supported them and labor, which worries that a solution to global warming could cost jobs. \""This is one of the most difficult decisions I will have had to make in 2 1/2 years I've been here,"" said U.S. Rep. Zack Space, DDover, whose district has been one of the hardest hit during the economic crisis. \For Republicans, it's easier: They've been calling the proposal a ""cap and tax"" for years. U.S. Reps. Steve Austria, R-Beavercreek; Mike Turner, R-Centerville; Jim Jordan, R-Urbana; Jean Schmidt, R-Loveland and House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-West Chester Twp., are united in their opposition. \Same with Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. But while Voinovich opposes the draft policies proposed in the House, he's introduced a bill aimed at expediting development of technology to reduce greenhouse gases. \Polls indicate voters want some sort of answer: One released by the Pew Environment Group found 77 percent of voters favor action to reduce global warming emissions. \House Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman, D-Calif., was still optimistic last week that he could get a bill passed through his committee by Memorial Day. \It's trickier in the Senate. Last year, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, was one of 10 Democrats who signed a letter saying they couldn't support climate legislation resembling the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act, which stalled on the Senate floor. He wrote then that any bill that passed had to protect U.S. manufacturing jobs and do something to lessen the burden on industrial states like Ohio, which stood to see a greater impact because of its reliance on coal-powered energy and manufacturing economy. \Brown said he now sees a climate change bill as being rife with possibility: He argues that properly written, it could create manufacturing jobs revolving around clean energy. And he argues that the best answer would include some ""border equalization"" so nations that don't have similar programs to cap greenhouse gases pay more at the border to import their more cheaply-made products. \Like Brown, U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Niles, sees opportunities for manufacturers, if the bill can protect jobs. U.S. steelmakers, he said, could benefit from a surge in steel-turbined wind generators. \The key is to get through the transition period without taking too much of a hit. \""I don't want my fingerprints on a bill that will deindustrialize the country further,"" Ryan said.\Credit: By Jessica Wehrman Staff Writer"
60,"America is a country that has historically been a leader in science. Our innovative and pioneering spirit pushed us to harness atomic energy, invent flight and send men to the moon. Our technological achievements have helped make us the most powerful country in the world. However, over the last few years, our country has gone through an unprecedented denial of scientific reasoning.\We are no longer a country that looks to science to tackle our greatest challenges. We have grown to dismiss research that does not fit our worldview as unproven or unreliable. From vaccinations to genetically modified organisms, Americans have let their politics get in the way of sound science. But perhaps the most dangerous of all science denial has been that of climate change.\Scientists having been telling us for decades that immediate steps must be taken to curtail the burning of fossil fuels to avoid catastrophe. The research is sound and verifiable. But because we have lost our faith in and value of science, we have delayed critical action that should have been taken decades ago. Instead of bringing a wide variety of solutions to the table, we have let our politics paralyze us.\We weren't always divided on this issue. For years the United States was a world leader in conservation. Members of all parts of the political spectrum have used science to create policies to protect our environment. President Richard Nixon established the EPA and signed the original Clean Water and Air Acts. President George H.W. Bush signed a cap-and-trade bill on sulfur emissions that protected us from acid rain. President Ronald Reagan signed the Montreal Protocol that banned the chlorofluorocarbons that were depleting the ozone layer, which has since regenerated. And President Teddy Roosevelt set aside millions of acres of the most pristine and beautiful land in the world to be saved forever. Each one of them used scientific research to take steps to protect the environment. They didn't use their party affiliation to ignore the problem. Instead, they saw what the scientific data was telling them and took bold action.\This bold action is the type of action we desperately need now if we are to avoid the worst effects of climate change. This will only happen if Americans begin to value science and scientific research once again. We can then implement both conservative and liberal solutions that address the very real threat of a warming planet. We can give individual citizens energy independence while concurrently utilizing wind and solar power. We can introduce free market principles and competition to our energy sector and move away from a carbon-based economy. We can tackle this challenge together, Republicans, Democrats and Independents.\So on this Earth Day, I call on citizens, no matter your background or political affiliation, to return to our roots as a scientifically literate society. I challenge us all to remember that science is not pushing an agenda but is about learning the truth based on verifiable and testable data. Hold our lawmakers accountable to find a solution to the scientifically verifiable problem of climate change. Do not accept justifications of ignorance, that they are not scientists and cannot make scientific judgments, or let them cite flawed research.\Do this because all Americans want and deserve a clean, sustainable and abundant Earth, with parks to hike in, land to hunt on, and air and water that is free of chemicals that could harm us. The only way we will solve the challenge of climate change is through a scientifically literate America that embraces research and values science as a guiding hand in our democracy.\Chris Anderson is an educator and resident of Over-the-Rhine.\Chris\Anderson"

Political and economic realities threaten the Obama administration and the European Union's mutual quest to combat global warming. Temperatures aren't helping much, either. Globally, the warming trend effectively ended more than a decade ago.
\
These inconvenient facts don't bode well for December's climate summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, where campaigners against global warming had hoped to arrive at a worldwide pact for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.
\
In addition to sizable political and economic conflicts stalling European and U.S. efforts, developing nations also are gumming up plans for a worldwide solution to the presumed threat.
\
China, India and other developing nations insist on receiving subsidies or even outright payments from developed nations like the United States, either as compensation for alleged harm suffered from the more prosperous nations' greenhouse-gas emissions, or to pay for reducing their own emissions. In essence, that would leave states like Ohio paying twice - once when the jobs disappear to meet the measures imposed, then again in higher taxes to pay these costs for other nations. African nations recently said they need $65 billion to cope with global warming's effects, essentially making an argument for reparations.
\
The fervent quest to curb greenhouse-gas emissions is worrisome enough, considering that the science allegedly proving the threat is increasingly shown to be faulty or even fraudulent. But, as is also increasingly obvious to those expected to foot the bill, proposed Draconian ""solutions"" to this likely nonexistent problem will do more harm than good.
\
Government curbs on greenhouse gases certainly would retard economic growth, while promising only unproven environmental gains. As India and China demonstrate, developing nations know curbing emissions means curbing economic well-being, a price they are unwilling to pay without at least being compensated.
\
The reality is that undeveloped nations are more polluted nations. Cleaning up the environment is not a top priority where people don't have enough to eat. For such nations, definite economic growth trumps reducing possible global warming of a degree or two. If this is abundantly clear to developing nations, it's becoming increasingly clear to those already developed.
\
Europe's cap-and-trade scheme was undermined recently by a Court of First Instance ruling that annulled the EU's attempt to lower Estonia and Poland's carbon emissions. ""The court said setting carbon limits is a matter for member states rather than the EU,"" reported EurActiv network.
\
The EU, unable to bring its own member nations in line, also is frustrated with the lack of progress in the U.S. The Obama administration is meeting staunch resistance in Congress to imposing similar restrictions on American industry, undermining the Copenhagen mission.
\
While these developments bode ill for worldwide Draconian regulations, they are good news for those who know prosperity is the best route to cleaner environment, irrespective of a degree or two increase or decline in temperature over the next century.

62,"
ILULISSAT, GREENLAND - Beyond the howl of sled dogs echoing across this hilly coastal village is the thunderclap of ancient icebergs splitting apart, a deafening rumble you feel in your bones.
\
There's no mistaking its big, loud, and powerful boom, a sound that can work up to a crescendo like rolling thunder. Or be as sudden as a shotgun blast.
\
Lifelong Greenland resident Karen Jessen Tannajik said people who live in Ilulissat - an Inuit word for icebergs - notice more about what's been calved by the village's nearby Sermeq Kujalleq glacier than sights and sounds.
\
""Right now, they're coming out so quick. There are not so many big ones, but many small ones,"" she said with almost a spiritual reverence as she talked about the village's world-famous procession of icebergs.
\
""When I am tired, I can watch them and feel them and smell them,"" she said, pausing for a big breath of air to help make her point. ""It seems like we get our power from them.""
\
Sermeq Kujalleq is the largest glacier in the northern hemisphere that flows out to sea. The icebergs it calves float along a fjord that was recognized as one of the wonders of the world when it was added to the 2004 World Heritage List by the United Nations, which cited its natural history, geology, and beauty.
\
Although millions of people across the world still aren't convinced global warming exists or that it's as big a problem as scientists claim, symptoms of the planet's warming pop up everywhere in Greenland.
\
The summer fishing season is longer. Crops are being grown in areas never thought possible. Tourism is booming.
\
Interest in oil exploration and mining has hit a feverish pitch, with several ""interesting"" projects under way, including the possibility of aluminum smelters being built there to take advantage of the island's hydropower potential, according to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
\
A recent editorial in the Copenhagen Post said Greenland is ""believed to be sitting on a mind boggling 10,000 billion kroner [nearly $2 trillion] worth of offshore oil reserves.""
\
Even the island's first-ever craft brewery, Greenland Beer, is a product of global warming. The company markets the water it uses as purer than what is found in other parts of the world because it comes from melted inland ice formed thousands of years before the Industrial Revolution.
\
But Greenland's long-term problems from global warming will likely overshadow such short-term gains.
\
A lack of sea ice has made winter passage between settlements more difficult, if not impossible. That's a huge problem because there are no roads between villages. Greenland is one of the only places on Earth that relies on sled dogs as a primary mode of transportation.
\
Fishing is Greenland's No. 1 industry. Mild winters, especially in Uummannaq on Greenland's west coast, have made it treacherous for residents to fish or hunt on what little ice there's been.
\
Greenland is the world's top producer of halibut and cold-water prawns, or shrimp. Halibut in particular have become more elusive, plunging to greater depths as the ocean temperature has warmed. Other species are moving in, but those gains are offset by the movement of whales toward the coast.
\
Whales have become so common near Ilulissat that two of the village's three tour operators began offering whale-watch excursions in 2007. Fishermen fear whales will act like vacuum cleaners, sucking down fish they want to catch.
\
Two leaders of the Ilulissat fishing community, Peter Olsen and Johanne Mathaussen, said the downward movement of halibut makes those fish more difficult and costly to catch. Full-sized halibut that used to be available at depths of about 1,000 feet now swim at depths of about 2,600 feet.
\
Another commercial fisherman, Gedion Lange, said long-line fishing he does with as many as 300 hooks at a time isn't as productive as it was in the 1990s.
\
Ove Rosbach, who has fished the Arctic for decades, blamed the decline on warmer ocean currents flowing to the north. He said a similar phenomenon occurred in the 1950s.
\
Halibut returned when the ocean current cooled in the 1970s, but Mr. Rosbach said things feel different now. ""[Even] when the sun is not shining, it's still very warm,"" he said. ""The sun is warmer than normal now.""
\
Niels Kristensen, an Ilulissat municipal official, said many fishermen can no longer catch what their quota allows. ""It's much more difficult because of the climate,"" he said.
\
Warming, cooling cycles
\
Greenland and its ice sheets are immense. The island spans 1,660 miles from north to south, longer than the distance from Maine to Cuba. From west to east, Greenland is 652 miles, just shy of the distance between Chicago and New York.
\
It is a fickle place. A Danish territory of 56,000 people, it has gone through extreme warming and cooling periods before.
\
Literature produced for visitors claims various cultures of Inuits have lived on Greenland for more than 4,500 years, although it also notes extensive periods in which the island had no inhabitants - usually when climatic conditions were so extremely cold there was little, if any, wildlife to hunt.
\
Legend has it the island got its name from a murderous Viking called Erik the Red, after he was ousted from Iceland about 950 A.D.
\
He reportedly put together a group of men to sail with him, with the lure of an island of lush greenery. That was more than 1,000 years ago, during the Medieval Warming Period - a climatic era that preceded the Little Ice Age and the island's modern ice sheet.
\
That ice sheet today is a hotbed for research as scientists from across the world study how the island is melting, sometimes with lakes appearing out of nowhere and the melt water vanishing suddenly through deep crevices known as moulins.
\
Greenland may be a harbinger of things to come, although it is second to Antarctica terms of ice.
\
Seventy-seven percent of the planet's fresh water is locked up in the ice sheets that cover Greenland and Antarctica, with about 70 percent of that in Antarctica. Ninety-eight percent of Antarctica is still covered by ice compared to Greenland's 80 percent.
\
Antarctica, the coldest and windiest place on Earth, is seven times the size of Greenland. It is less prone to melt. Portions of that continent's ice sheet are actually thickening, a reminder of how much more rugged the South Pole is than the North Pole. Antarctica has 250 days a year that are 50 degrees below zero or colder.
\
Far-reaching effects
\
While politicians remain in a quandary over what to do about global warming, change is coming that will affect life everywhere from the Himalayan mountain range in Asia to the Great Lakes region of North America.
\
Peru's political instability is further threatened by changes in water flow as glaciers retreat in the central Andes mountains, resulting in less water for agriculture and hydroelectric power.
\
Southern Africa is expected to lose 30 percent of its staple food, corn, by 2030. As London-based journalist Gwynne Dyer noted in a column earlier this year: ""No part of the developing world can lose one-third of its main food crop without descending into desperate poverty and violence.""
\
And even if the most conservative estimate for sea level rise materializes - 1 meter, or about 3.3 feet of water by 2100 - low-lying regions of the South Pacific and South Asia will be flooded. The result could be a mass exodus of people from one of the poorest and most populated regions of the world.
\
America's Gulf Coast, the southern tip of Florida, and parts of the Atlantic seaboard would be submerged as well.
\
The prospect of mass flooding by the end of this century, though, has taken a back seat to more immediate changes in the Arctic Circle's northwest passage, especially with gasoline being sold in the United States between $3 and $4 a gallon.
\
Russia - second only to the Middle East in oil reserves - last year staked claim to the North Pole, where speculation about huge petroleum reserves runs rampant.
\
Once impassable to ships, the northwest passage has become a tug-of-war involving Russia, the United States, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Greenland, and Iceland.
\
""The potential is there for an outbreak of tensions we have not seen since the Cold War days,"" said Rob Huebert, associate director of the University of Calgary's Centre for Military and Strategic Studies.
\
The Arctic's warming climate has opened up the passageway to more than just oil tankers and cargo ships.
\
Oliver Pitras, 48, of Norway, said he has seen sailboat traffic on the rise. He sailed through the northwest passage in 1999 and is spending five months crossing it now at the helm of a yearlong sailing expedition he began taking around the world May 17 to raise global awareness of climate change. Details of his trip are at 69nord.com. ""We're talking about the opening of a common route,"" he said. ""But it's still a delicate situation.""
\
Last year, several congressmen were stunned to learn that summer sea ice could be gone from the Arctic by 2015 - well ahead of the earlier projection of 2050, said Daniel Schrag, director of Harvard University's Center for the Environment.
\
Human activity
\
Changes to the Earth's climate are nothing new. Scientists believe natural climate variations occur every 100,000 years based on how the planet spins, tilts, and orbits around the sun.
\
The sun itself changes. NASA believes that volcanic eruptions on Earth, coupled with natural changes to the sun, explain warming and cooling from 1000 through 1850.
\
But the space agency also believes that Earth has been on a one-way warming trend triggered by human activity since the Industrial Revolution began about 1850.
\
Heat-trapping carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas, is on a course to exceed 500 parts per million in the atmosphere later this century, something the human race has never experienced, Mr. Schrag said.
\
An abundance of greenhouse gases means higher temperatures on land and in the oceans. The gases rise in the atmosphere and trap the sun's energy, keeping heat from escaping back into space.
\
A climate variation of 3 to 5 degrees ""is a really big deal,"" considering that much of the Earth was covered in ice 18,000 years ago when the planet was only an average of 5 degrees cooler, Mr. Schrag said.
\
""We are performing an experiment at a planetary scale that hasn't been done for millions of years. No one knows exactly what will happen,"" he said.
\
'Unequivocal' warming
\
The scientific consensus about climate change is based primarily around evidence of increasing air and ocean temperatures, accelerated melting of snow and ice at the polar ice caps, and rising ocean levels.
\
Records on global surface temperatures only go back to 1850. But the world's most prestigious body of climatologists - the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - noted in its landmark 2007 series of climate reports that the Earth's average temperatures for 11 of the 12 years from 1995 to 2006 were at or near record-high levels.
\
Those reports concluded there has been ""unequivocal"" warming of the planet and claimed with a certainty of greater than 90 percent that human activity was largely responsible. The data those reports used came, in part, from satellite images showing an accelerated loss of northern polar sea ice since 1978 and a rise in average sea levels since 1961 - accelerating after 1993.
\
About 600 scientists from 40 U.N. countries and the World Meteorological Organization were involved in producing those reports. Scientists directly involved with the panel's work shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President Al Gore. Since losing the 2000 presidential race, Mr. Gore has given countless lectures across the country about global warming. He authored the book, An Inconvenient Truth, and won an Academy Award for the documentary based on it.
\
The greatest single source of human-generated carbon dioxide comes from coal-fired power plants. Other major contributors include factories and automobiles.
\
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change findings were preceded by a 2001 report by America's most prestigious group of government scientists - the National Academy of Sciences - which stated explicitly that human activity has affected the Earth's climate. Similar statements have been issued by a consortium of 13 federal agencies called the U.S. Climate Change Science Program.
\
'A shared risk'
\
Ellen Mosley-Thompson of Ohio State University's Byrd Polar Research Center said public officials and lobbyists have wasted valuable time disputing the science behind climate change.
\
She wonders how many naysayers would get into their automobiles without making some adjustments if they learned there was greater than a 90 percent chance they'd get in a wreck. ""The difference is that [climate change] is a shared risk,"" she said.
\
People identify with symbols, but are they doing so at their own peril by dismissing climate change as some distant problem that just affects polar bears? Why aren't connections being made?
\
The cost of dealing with climate change is one reason.
\
Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain agree the United States must get more aggressive about controlling carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants but aren't sure whether a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade approach is best.
\
The Edison Electric Institute said it cannot quantify how much a carbon tax would drive up electric bills but said the cost would be ""substantial."" Under a cap-and-trade program, the government would place a limit on emissions and force utilities to barter for carbon credits with other utilities.
\
A matter of degree
\
Few Toledoans probably realize they live in the 41st Parallel North, meaning they are 41 degrees above the equator, or less than halfway to the North Pole. The effects of climate change are more acute near the relatively uninhabited poles, where average temperatures are rising twice as fast as they are near the equator.
\
Most Ilulissat residents know they're in the 69th Parallel North, which is 69 degrees above the equator and nearly two-thirds of the way to the North Pole. One of Ilulissat's soccer teams is named I-69, after the village's latitude.
\
Ilulissat is Greenland's third-largest village, with 4,500 people and just as many sled dogs. Each summer, it hosts dozens of researchers and hundreds of tourists. Many of the latter see Greenland's famous Eqi glacier breaking off into seawater from the comfort of luxury cruise ships.
\
Influential U.S. lawmakers, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), have recently stayed in the village's posh Hotel Arctic, as have celebrities such as pop singer Bjork and New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman. The hotel is in the midst of doubling in size.
\
Regardless where they stay, nearly everyone who visits Ilulissat seems to have a feeling of suspended reality when they open their hotel blinds each morning.
\
Almost without fail, the icebergs they saw the night before have been replaced by new ones.
\
How can such massive hunks of ice come and go so fast? After all, they were formed from thousands of years of compressed snow. And they look harder to budge than skyscrapers.
\
But it happens. The frequency that the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier calved icebergs over the past decade rose, throwing some of the world's top Greenland experts for a loop.
\
One of them is Swiss-born Konrad ""Koni"" Steffen of the University of Colorado. He has done field work in the Arctic since 1975 and on Greenland's ice sheet at least once every year since 1990. His work is cited in major publications. He is at the table of most major climate talks.
\
Conventional wisdom during the 1970s was that Greenland's ice sheet would take thousands of years to melt.
\
""Nobody would have predicted 10 to 15 years ago that Greenland would lose ice that fast,"" Mr. Steffen said. ""That revises all of the textbooks.""
\
His take-home message: Forget the scientific modeling. Greenland is melting faster than anyone's best guess.
\
""How can you have an ice sheet so big and respond that quickly?"" he asked. ""That is still part of the mystery, to be honest.""
\
Ohio State's Jason Box is perhaps the most famous of Mr. Steffen's former students, having done research in Greenland every summer except one since 1994.
\
Mr. Box has likewise gained attention from the national media for his work. He synthesizes data he and others generate into a ""holistic"" view of Greenland's thaw, using a number of tools, including time-lapse photography.
\
A costly problem
\
Americans may fret about paying more for electricity if the next Congress enacts a carbon tax or strict regulations on utilities to combat global warming. But Mr. Box said that cost will be a fraction of what adapting to climate change will cost, especially if nothing's done to curb emissions now.
\
Billions of dollars will be needed to construct New Orleans-like levees along the nation's coastline to guard against flooding, he said.
\
""It's going to get too expensive for the U.S. to mitigate,"" Mr. Box said. ""It's going to be kind of like taking on a global war against terrorism. It's going to be too expensive. It's going to sap the U.S. economy.""
\
Sea level rise is ""going to cost people whether their properties are flooded or not,"" he said.
\
On average, Greenland's ice sheet loses 300 billion tons of ice a year. That hasn't been enough to raise global sea level a millimeter a year, though.
\
The Greenland ice sheet has been eroding almost annually for 50 years, except for a short period in the 1970s when temperatures were cool enough in summer to keep it ""in balance"" by rejuvenating itself enough in winter.
\
But the greatest ice losses on record are recent - in 2003, 2005, and 2007, Mr. Box said.
\
Losing ground
\
In Alaska, coastal villages are eroding. Long stretches of highway are impassable for months at a time because they were built on permafrost that is melting.
\
One of the most impacted villages, Newtok (population 400), was told in June that it will get $3.3 million in state aid to help relocate displaced residents to higher ground.
\
Alaska is putting aside nearly $13 million to protect six remote villages in the coming year. That could only be the beginning of a massive tab for taxpayers. According to the Government Accountability Office, erosion and flooding affect 184 of Alaska's 213 native villages to some degree.
\
In Greenland, Ilulissat's soccer field is slumping because of permafrost melt. Tourists hiking marked trails to see the village's famous glacier feel the spongy soil.
\
During the Republican National Convention, TV crews aired sound bytes from delegates who said they'll leave the Earth's climate in God's hands.
\
""It's actually not a faith issue but whether or not you believe in the science. In its purest form [climate change] is objective science,"" Mr. Box said. ""The ice in the Arctic is the canary in the coal mine. To put it bluntly, the canary is dead.""

"
63,"DAYTON -- Democrat Barack Obama on Friday, July 11, delivered some tough medicine to Dayton about how he plans to wean America off its dependence on foreign oil. \His plan calls for doubling the federal fuel efficiency standards within 20 years and investing $150 billion over 10 years in alternative fuels. \Dayton is a victim of high gas prices and a slumping economy: General Motors last month announced plans to close its Moraine sport utility vehicle assembly plant and eliminate its 2,500 jobs. \""If we stay on our current course, the rapid growth of nations like China and India will rise about onethird by 2030. In that same year, Middle Eastern regimes will be sitting on 83 percent of our global oil reserves. Imagine that -- the very source of energy that fuels nearly all of our transportation, controlled almost entirely by some of the world's most unstable and undemocratic governments,"" Obama told 1,300 supporters at Stivers School for the Arts in Dayton. ""This is not the future I want for America. We are not a country that places our fate in the hands of dictators and tyrants -- we are a nation that controls our own destiny. That's who we are. That's who we've always been."" \Rhine McLin, Dayton's mayor and Democratic Convention superdelegate, said ""It's not a quick fix. But I respected this because he had a vision of where he wants to go by 2030 ... How often do you hear elected officials saying there's no quick fix?"" \Republican presidential hopeful John McCain's campaign had a different take: ""Today, Barack Obama criticized wind, hydropower, domestic oil drilling, gas tax relief and nuclear power but did not offer a single proposal to bring down gas prices. The difference is Obama's 'Dr. No' approach believes that every energy source has a problem and John McCain believes that every energy source can be part of the solution Americans need right now."" \Obama and McCain both traveled to Ohio this week, stumping for votes and talking about their plans for energy and the economy. \""When candidates compete for the green vote, the environment, consumers and even business win,"" said Jack Shaner of the Ohio Environmental Council. ""We love this bidding war over who has the best energy plan. Bring it on! At four bucks for a gallon of gasoline, energy and the environment are suddenly pocketbook issues. And any graduate of politics 101 will tell you that pocketbook issues trump all others at the ballot box."" \Both candidates have likened the challenge of gaining energy independence to putting a man on the moon in the 1960s. \Obama promised long-term solutions that would require sacrifice and investment and he criticized McCain's plans as gimmicks, such as a gas tax holiday and offshore drilling, that he said will have no significant impact. \Obama painted McCain as one of the Washington politicians who has done little to curb America's reliance on foreign oil over the past three decades. \""So when John McCain talks about the failure politicians in Washington to do anything about our energy crisis, understand that John McCain should look in the mirror because he has been a part of that failure,"" Obama said. \Obama proposes investing $150 billion over 10 years in alternative energy, $1,000 tax credit for middle income families to help pay for high prices at the pump, a doubling of federal fuel efficiency standards over the next 20 years, and a requirement that 25 percent of America's electricity be generated from renewable resources by 2025. \His plan includes tax credits and loans for automakers to help them make the transition, he said. \McCain's plan calls for a $300 million prize to whoever advances battery technology to achieve a plug-in hybrid car, $2 billion a year in clean coal technology research, and lifting a ban on drilling for oil and natural gas off American coasts. \Both men favor instituting a cap-and-trade credit program to curb greenhouse gases. \Obama discusses DHL situation with Wilmington mayor \Before the town hall event, Obama met with Wilmington Mayor David Raizk and DHL workers who are among the 8,600 likely to lose their jobs when DHL changes package handlers from ABX Air to UPS. \The Ohio congressional delegation is asking the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate whether the proposed change violates federal antitrust laws. \At a town hall meeting in Portsmouth, McCain told a woman if there are antitrust implications, he would support a thorough investigation. He also said retraining programs are important. \""We are in a period of transition to a global economy. That is of no consolation to anyone who is losing their job. That is no consolation. But we have to offer them an opportunity to get the education and retraining programs so they can re-enter the job market,"" McCain said in Portsmouth. \Get the latest national \and local political news \at DaytonDailyNews.com/politics"
64,"
By now, you've probably heard of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's much-heralded ""Clean Power Plan."" What you might not have heard is how much it will increase electricity prices with minimal or even no effect on the environment.
\
Electric cooperatives like Holmes-Wayne Electric Cooperative oppose the Clean Power Plan because it defies common sense, plain and simple. As a not-for-profit consumer-owned electric cooperative, we have an obligation to provide our member-owners with affordable, reliable, environmentally responsible electricity at cost.
\
So naturally we want to protect our consumer-members from hikes in their monthly bills. Despite EPA's claims that consumers will eventually save on their electric bills, the calculations of many trade groups and utilities have found the exact opposite; the only disagreement among them is just how much electricity costs will increase. Apparently, the EPA did not account for the much higher price tag attached to producing electricity the way the Clean Power Plan mandates.
\
This heavy-handed regulation calls for a massive ramp-up of renewable energy, regardless of price. Renewable energy has proven to produce power at higher costs and is intermittent, meaning power sources like wind and solar require a reliable backup source, such as coal or natural gas. If utilities like Buckeye Power, Holmes-Wayne Electric Cooperative's wholesale power supplier, are required to arbitrarily replace coal with natural gas and renewable energy, consumers will be left with huge stranded costs for power plants that still have many years of useful life.
\
We want clean air and water as much as anyone. But the EPA's proposal is unreasonable, unnecessary, and possibly illegal.
\
Why is it unnecessary? Emissions of all types from power plants have been dramatically reduced over the past 10 years because utilities have invested in environmental controls on coal-fired power plants. Buckeye Power's Cardinal Generating Station is now one of the cleanest power plants of its kind in the entire world, following the installation of more than $1 billion of emissions control equipment over the past 12 years. Cardinal supplies reliable, affordable, environmentally responsible electricity to the 25 electric cooperatives serving Ohio's 400,000 consumer-members.
\
Utilities are also voluntarily closing less-efficient coal-fired power plants and replacing that generation with natural gas and sensible renewable energy. Carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, which is what the Clean Power Plan is targeting, have already been reduced 19.4 percent since 2005, and further reductions are near certain without the EPA's interference.
\
What's most troubling about these numbers is that even the EPA, by its own calculations, admits these drastic regulations in the U.S. will only minimally affect global carbon dioxide emissions. Some reports state reductions will not even offset the new plant emissions for the fast growing industrial countries like China and India.
\
Why do we think it's illegal? Ohio and 25 other states contend that the Clean Power Plan is a huge over-reach of the EPA's authority under the Clean Air Act. In essence, the EPA -- a regulatory agency -- is making an end-run around Congress. The EPA is trying to replace by force the ""cap and trade"" legislation that failed to pass Congress in 2008.
\
Even the director of the Ohio EPA, Craig Butler, believes the plan is outside the federal EPA's authority. ""While we continue to review the final rule presented by U.S. EPA on Aug. 3, our fundamental legal and technical concerns persist or continue to grow,"" Butler testified in September before the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space and Technology's Subcommittee on Environment.
\
He told the subcommittee that Ohio has benefited from using an ""all fuels"" approach to generating power, but the EPA's plan will mandate a ""significant expansion of renewable generation across the country, regardless of practicality or cost.""
\
By forcing excessive investment in renewable energy, the Clean Power Plan will prematurely retire coal-fired power plants. Not only will that increase electricity costs, but it will make the power grid less reliable. No one wants less reliable electricity.
\
The bottom line: The EPA's Clean Power Plan imposes huge costs and a tremendous regulatory burden on states, and utilities will likely reduce carbon dioxide emissions by only a few percentage points beyond what would have happened without this unreasonable regulation.
\
To this end, Ohio's electric cooperatives, along with 36 other wholesale power suppliers, Ohio EPA and 25 other state EPA offices are suing the U.S. EPA through the Federal D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to stay the implementation of the EPA's so-called Clean Power Plan while the courts determine whether this regulation is even legal.
\
Please join your electric cooperative by telling the White House to reconsider the Clean Power Plan and bring forth a plan that considers the affordability and reliability of power generation along with environmental responsibility. Visit www.Action.coop to learn more.

65,"
Three months after halting construction of a mammoth $3.3 billion coal-fired power plant it had proposed for southern Ohio's Meigs County, American Municipal Power Inc. is following through with a $2 billion investment in five hydroelectric projects at existing dams along the Ohio River.
\
Seventy-nine of AMP's 126 member communities have committed themselves financially.
\
Nearly a third of those investors are small and mid-sized communities in northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan, including Bowling Green, Napoleon, Bryan, Clyde, Deshler, Edgerton, Elmore, Genoa, Montpelier, Oak Harbor, Pemberville, Pioneer, Sycamore, Woodville, and Hillsdale. They're each hoping to stabilize their budgets with a clean, renewable form of energy that offers competitive prices and predictable costs. The amount of electricity that AMP provides each community depends on their respective levels of investment.
\
""We're doing the hydros because we feel it's the right thing to do. We feel it's going to be the least impact on our people,"" said Napoleon City Manager Jon Bisher, who also chairs AMP's board of directors.
\
The existing dams and locks are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Years of water-flow data have been collected by that government agency to assist in planning for what is known as ""run-of-the-river"" hydroelectric projects. Those are ones that have less impact on the environment because there is minimal disturbance of river currents, Mr. Bisher said.
\
""Right now, we really believe this run-of-the-river hydro [technology], for this part of the country, is the best form of alternative energy,"" he said.
\
The hydro projects span the length of the river, from the Illinois-Kentucky border to the Ohio-West Virginia border. They range from $276 million to $416 million. Each is to create 200 to 400 temporary construction jobs, up to a dozen permanent jobs, and 44 to 111 megawatts of electricity.
\
Together, they will add more than 350 megawatts to AMP's portfolio. Every megawatt a utility produces is roughly enough power for 1,000 homes, though the ratio is not as good when demand for electricity peaks during the summer.
\
The breakdown goes like this:
\
- Cannelton Locks and Dam began a $416 million facelift on the Kentucky side of the river in May. Once finished in the fall of 2013, that hydroelectric facility is to employ 9 to 12 people and generate 84 megawatts of power.
\
- Smithland Locks and Dam started having $432 million of work done on the Kentucky side of the river Feb. 16, with the execution of a contract with C.J. Mahan Construction Co. of Grove City, Ohio. Scheduled to be completed in the spring of 2014, that hydroelectric facility is to employ seven to nine people, and generate 76 megawatts of power.
\
- Willow Island Locks and Dam is slated to have $276 million of work begin soon on the West Virginia side of the river. Seven to nine permanent jobs are to be created, and the facility is to generate 44 megawatts of power.
\
- Capt. Anthony Meldahl Locks and Dam is to undergo $473 million of improvements on the Kentucky side of the river, a project being done in cooperation with the facility's license holder, the city of Hamilton, Ohio. Work has not commenced, but the project is expected to be done in early 2014. It is to employ seven to nine people and generate 111 megawatts of power.
\
- Robert C. Byrd Locks and Dam, near Gallipolis, Ohio, is slated for $300 million of work. The side of the river where the construction will be done has not been determined nor has the number of people to be employed once it's operating. The utility expects it to produce 48 megawatts of power.
\
Environmental issues
\
AMP has past experience with hydro power; it has operated its Belleville Hydroelectric Plant on the Ohio River since April, 1999. That plant provides power to 42 cities and towns.
\
The utility has found that project to be both reliable from a technology standpoint and predictable in terms of costs, Mr. Bisher said.
\
Founded in 1971 to negotiate electric rates for its member communities, AMP - formerly known as AMP-Ohio - is a nonprofit, Columbus-based wholesale power supplier. The company has shortened its name to reflect its broadening membership base. AMP now represents and supplies power to 126 cities, towns, and villages in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia.
\
The timing of AMP's five latest hydroelectric projects could help the company mend fences with environmental groups, which generally see hydro as less harmful to the environment than coal.
\
""We are pleased that AMP is back in the 'mainstream' again, doing what they do best - being a leader in cleaner energy,"" said Trent Dougherty, director of legal affairs for the Ohio Environmental Council, a consortium of environmental groups across the state. ""While hydro-power is not environmentally benign, AMP's project is a lower-impact hydro project that will help Ohio loosen the shackles of dirty coal power,"" Mr. Dougherty said.
\
Spokesmen for two other environmental groups - the Natural Resources Defense Council and Ohio Citizen Action - declined comment on the hydro projects. Both groups opposed the coal-fired power plant.
\
Hydro's biggest drawback usually is its impact on fisheries.
\
AMP is working with state and federal officials to co-exist with native fish and mussel populations. It will incorporate a number of design features, including slow-moving turbines, to make the projects viable.
\
""Trust me,"" said Marc Gerken, AMP president and chief executive officer. ""It's fun running a hydro plant compared to a coal plant.""
\
Coal plant project
\
Mr. Bisher said he was disappointed by the backlash AMP received over the Meigs County project. He said some environmentalists who once viewed AMP as an ally for helping to bring wind power to Ohio never accepted AMP's plans to mitigate the proposed coal-fired power plant's impact with state-of-the-art pollution controls.
\
To environmentalists, the Meigs County project was just another dirty coal plant in the making, Mr. Bisher said.
\
Through their campaigns, activists enlisted people to flood mailboxes. Mr. Bisher said he received what seemed like 100 letters a day from opponents.
\
""I will tell you my life has gotten considerably easier from an environmentalist point of view,"" he said. ""You certainly don't get those letters when you're doing a run-of-the-river hydro project.""
\
AMP maintains its decision to pull away from the Meigs County project was in response to changing market conditions and increased labor costs - not pressure from environmentalists. ""It was totally a numbers thing,"" Mr. Gerken said.
\
The proposed coal-fired power plant was to generate 1,000 megawatts of electricity. That's more than FirstEnergy Corp.'s Davis-Besse nuclear plant in Ottawa County produces and is nearly five times the output of AMP's existing hydroelectic plant along the Ohio River.
\
AMP was in the early stages of building the Meigs County project but cited a 37 percent increase - or about $800 million more - between its contractor's May and November estimates.
\
When plans for the coal-fired power plant were announced in October, 2005, the cost was pegged at $1.2 billion. AMP pulled the plug in November following the latest of several price increases, figuring it was better off cutting its losses and terminating contracts.
\
Though it had planned to use a patented process that claimed to be among the most effective at removing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, AMP also came to grips with the likelihood that restrictive cap-and-trade legislation could soon pass in the U.S. Senate. A bill passed in the U.S. House last year.
\
""If you look at where we're headed with greenhouse gas legislation - and it's coming sooner than later - we need to manage our carbon footprint,"" Mr. Gerken said.
\
""I think we all recognize the need to be a little more carbon free,"" he added. ""Right now, we have no blueprint. That's why a lot of industry is leaving this country. They're not going to wait to see what the regulations are.""
\
Diversification
\
AMP has diversified with wind power, as well as hydro.
\
It owns the four wind turbines southwest of Bowling Green, providing electricity from them to that city and others that are part of a cooperative agreement.
\
AMP has proposed erecting another six wind turbines in Wood County.
\
But wind turbines operate at only 23 percent to 30 percent efficiency, Mr. Gerken said.
\
The utility is exploring an investment in solar but figures its efficiency is less, he said.
\
""These hydros will get you to 60 to 65 percent [efficiency],"" Mr. Gerken said.
\
The coal-fired power plant was to generate 1,600 temporary construction jobs and 165 full-time operators.
\
One of the world's largest contractors, Bechtel Power Corp. of San Francisco, oversaw construction.
\
AMP received $30 million in federal stimulus dollars for the project.
\
The Andersons of Maumee had a contract to crystallize the coal-fired power plant's waste by-product, ammonia sulfate, into a fertilizer.
\
AMP is now looking for ways to scale down the shuttered Meigs County project and covert it to a natural gas combined cycle facility.
\
The utility is examining how biomass or another form of advanced energy technology could become the site's fuel source, Kent Carson, a senior AMP spokesman, has said.

Carbon emission auction a bad idea, Congress told
\
Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky customers of Duke Energy Corp. could see a more than 50 percent increase in their electric bills in five years if one provision of a federal climate change bill becomes law, the utility warned Thursday.
\
James Rogers, who became Duke's top executive with its 2006 merger with Cinergy Corp., has been one of the utility industry's most vocal advocates of national action to reduce greenhouse gases believed to be a leading source of global warming.
\
Rogers said Thursday he supports most of America's Climate Security Act of 2007, introduced last month by Sens. Joseph Lieberman, D.-Conn., and John Warner, R-Va. The legislation would reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below 1990 levels by 2020 by capping them at government set levels and allowing companies and utilities to trade pollution credits.
\
But Rogers said a provision calling for a government auction of most of the carbon emission credits would hit 25 states, including Ohio and Kentucky, that generate most of their electricity with coal disproportionately hard.
\
""Having to obtain allowances for existing coal plants through an auction is nothing more than a carbon tax,"" said Rogers. Some energy lobbyists have estimated the bill's cap-and-trade program would cost the average family more than $1,000 annually, according to Forbes.com.
\
""A carbon tax punishes states like Ohio and Kentucky for decisions made 40 years ago when carbon wasn't an issue,"" he said in an interview.
\
The auction mechanism has support from government officials who see it as a revenue source, Wall Street traders who see profit from trading the allowances and hard-core environmentalists who want to eliminate coal as an energy source, Rogers said.
\
David Celebrezze of the Ohio Environmental Council, who is following the Lieberman-Warner legislation, said he thought Rogers' concerns are overstated. ""I don't see it having an adverse effect on consumer rates,"" he said. ""If we don't have mandates, we're just spinning our wheels.""
\
Rogers said a better approach was that used in the 1990 Clean Air Act to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions.
\
Under that law tradable credits were issued to firms based on their emission levels and reduced over time. ""That system provided a transition period to protect consumers and regional economies while cleaner technologies were developed and commercialized,"" Rogers said.
\
Duke issued its analysis of the impact of the emission allowance auction Thursday as the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee held its last hearing on the bill. The legislation still has be approved by the full Senate and House, but Rogers said he wanted to raise awareness of the bill's cost before it is reported out of committee.
\
Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, testified at Thursday's hearing, urging the committee chaired by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., to do more analysis of the bill's impact.
\
""This bill contemplates a massive bureaucratic intrusion into Americans' lives that will have a profound impact on businesses, communities and families,"" Voinovich said. He cited one analysis by Charles River Associates, a consulting firm, estimating the legislation could cost as many as 3.4 million U.S. jobs.
\
Duke's analysis of the auction provisions indicates that allowance prices could be $45 a ton initially, resulting in a 53 percent increase in customer bills if the legislation took effect in 2012. Electric bills would rise further in subsequent years as allocations decreased and more had to be purchased through auction.

ST. MARYS -- Access to safe, clean, cheap energy will drive the U.S. economy, legislators told a crowd Tuesday at Midwest Electric's annual member breakfast.
\
U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Urbana; U.S. Rep. Bob Latta, R-Bowling Green; Ohio Senate President Keith Faber, R-Celina; Ohio Rep. Matt Huffman, R-Lima; and Ohio Rep. Jim Buchy, R-Greenville spoke at the co-op Owners for Political Action meeting.
\
Midwest Electric has 700 members who belong to the PAC; more than 200 attended the breakfast.
\
Latta, who sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said he is concerned about the Obama administration's executive orders on environmental regulation in the absence of legislation. Latta said over-regulation of coal plants causes them to close and prices to increase, resulting in a slower economy.
\
""If we don't have power, we're not working,"" Latta said.
\
Jordan thanked the crowd for its political action in opposing efforts to regulate greenhouse gases.
\
""But for your efforts, cap and trade would be the law of the land today,"" Jordan said.
\
Two people in the crowd asked legislators about drilling for oil and natural gas in eastern Ohio and expressed concerns about earthquakes and contamination of ground water. Legislators said they have laws in place to ensure the drilling is done safely and doesn't harm the environment. The lawmakers said drilling is leading to strong economic growth in places of Ohio.
\
""Hotel owners, restaurant owners, landowners, ask them, 'Is fracking a good thing?' Oh yeah,"" Huffman said. ""For the first time, they're able to do a lot of things they were not able to because of the economic boom.""

68,"
I am responding to Kelly Anspaugh's letter of Thursday (""Thoughts to go with warming questions""). It is ironic (and amusing) that instead of addressing the questions I posed, he continued to belabor the Big Tobacco-Big Energy link. We, as taxpayers, are indebted to him for pointing this out, for it is precisely this link that often goes unmentioned in the popular press.
\
The two situations are indeed quite similar, because in both cases it is the big moneyed interests (like the erstwhile Enron and the charlatan Al Gore) who seek to subvert science in their rush to profit from the hapless medium- to low-income taxpayer. If it was wrong decades ago for Big Tobacco to deceive the public about the dangers of smoking (and it was), it is just as wrong today for climate alarmists to deceive the public about the ""dangers"" of carbon.
\
Many wealthy investors have sunk significant capital into so-called green technologies, insisting they are concerned about the environment. They are so concerned, in fact, that they are now heavily lobbying Congress to mandate the use of these technologies. The allegedly altruistic greens would then stand to make billions if the U.S. ever fully embraces the loony cap-and-trade scheme.
\
I respect Mr. Anspaugh's passion and commitment to a cause. And I agree that some causes are so important that they require our full devotion. However, I hope he can come to understand that passionate emotionalism cannot be allowed to play a major role in deciding scientific issues. And he should realize that credulity is no substitute for empiricism.

ALLEN COUNTY - County leaders came out Friday hoping to get word to Sen. George Voinovich. That word was ""Help.""
\
Wesley Fahrbach, district representative for Voinovich, was in town Friday to speak with local leaders. A half-dozen people came out for a public hearing at the county courthouse to discuss issues ranging from gas prices and the recently passed farm bill to carbon and environmental regulations.
\
Lima Finance Director Steve Cleaves spoke on the carbon cap-and-trade proposal Voinovich has thus far opposed. The system is supposedly designed to create a financial incentive for emission reductions by assigning a cost to polluting. Regulators would establish a ""cap"" on emissions from a designated group of polluters, such as power plants, to a level lower than their current emissions. The emissions allowed under the new cap are then divided up into individual permits - usually equal to one ton of pollution - that represent the right to emit that amount.
\
Acknowledging the cost of carbon and other pollutants is a necessary step in cleaning up the environment and leveling the playing field between existing and emerging energy sources, Cleaves said.
\
""We have no recognition of the cost of carbon in the production of energy. Until we recognize that, what we're doing is, in effect, subsidizing old technology,"" Cleaves said.
\
The city of Lima has an interest in carbon caps because of the proposed Global Energy project. That plant would have few emissions, meaning it would compete better against current plants if they were forced to pay for their emissions.
\
Fahrbach said Voinovich is concerned about the economics of the proposal.
\
""He feels that it had to be based on economic merit, not just something forced on business,"" Fahrbach said.
\
Environmental concerns were also on Bluffton Mayor Fred Rodabaugh's mind. Recent changes to Environmental Protection Agency standards on mercury could cost the village thousands of dollars. The new regulations came just months after the village completed its new sewer plant, designed to meet EPA standards before the change. The same thing happened with ozone standards earlier this year.
\
""Why even try to reach these discharge standards with the EPA is, as soon as you meet them they just raise them?"" Rodabaugh asked. ""The utilities are just becoming prohibitive, and the mandates just keep coming.""
\
Fahrbach said he would take the local concerns back to Voinovich and make sure the senator is aware of the issues facing Allen County.
\
""I'll type them up Monday and put them in the senator's reading material,"" Fahrbach said. ""He wants to know what's going on here.""

COLUMBUS - Gov. Ted Strickland yesterday accused Republican opponent John Kasich of being ""ill-informed"" and ""reckless"" in saying he may consider rolling back mandates that Ohio utilities find more of their power from renewable sources such as solar and wind.
\
Mr. Kasich reportedly told the editorial board at the Dayton Daily News last week that he might ease the requirements ""if it drives up costs to consumers.""
\
""It will drive up utility bills because we don't have it ready and have to buy it somewhere else. I don't like that, and you can't mandate invention,"" he said, according to the newspaper.
\
The governor accused Mr. Kasich of speaking without having all the facts, adding it to the Republican's prior vows to kill a proposed passenger rail line connecting Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, and Cincinnati; to undo reforms of Ohio's K-12 education system pushed through last year; and to fight a plan to place wind turbines on Lake Erie.
\
Mr. Strickland noted Ohio's electricity regulation law already would allow a waiver of the mandate if it drives up costs to consumers more than 3 percent.
\
""New-energy jobs are the wave of the future and creating a new energy standard not only means a better environment for future Ohioans, it means that growing advanced energy companies, such as the ones standing with me, are locating and growing right here in Ohio."" Mr. Strickland said.
\
He spoke in the Columbus offices of DesignGroup, a company that designs buildings that employ energy conservation tools such as sun screens and uses renewable and recycled materials.
\
""Toledo, as many Ohioans already know, is a solar powerhouse,"" Mr. Strickland said. ""I was recently at the opening of the Wyandot solar farm, which uses 159,000 solar panels covering 80 acres, all of which were made right here in Ohio.""
\
Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols, however, said the Republican gubernatorial candidate does not oppose the renewable energy standard and would not try to repeal it.
\
""He supports increasing renewable generation in Ohio in a way that expands our energy choices,"" Mr. Nichols said. ""He wants to do everything possible to prevent Ohio's utilities from having to buy expensive electricity from other states and raise prices on businesses and homeowners. One of the greatest threats to Ohio's long-term competitiveness is Ted Strickland's support for the Obama climate-change policies which will kill Ohio's low-cost coal power and cripple our manufacturing jobs.""
\
Mr. Strickland has said he opposes President Obama's cap-and-trade plan, citing concerns that emissions controls would adversely impact industrialized states such as Ohio.
\
Nearly three years ago, Ohio backed away from its initial plan to deregulate the electricity industry after similar experiments in other states saw a spike in prices. In addition to establishing a new model for setting rates, the law attempts to force a market for renewable power such as solar and wind and advanced technology, including cleaner coal, nuclear power, and fuel cells.
\
Power companies such as Toledo Edison's parent, FirstEnergy, must find at least 25 percent of their electricity from such sources by 2025. Half of that, or 12.5 percent, must come from true renewable resources and at least half a percentage point of that must come from solar, a nod to the Toledo area's solar industry.

Or we could find ourselves replaying painful memories of earth-friendly proposals like the Kyoto Protocols and cap-and-trade legislation that crashed into the realities of American politics, leaving advocates to pick up the pieces.\Based on the latest United Nations report, we may not get another opportunity to change course before the most devastating impacts of climate change become inescapable. That's why we need to make sure this effort succeeds. As dynamic new leaders focus on a national Green New Deal, I hope they take a hard look at the lessons available in California.\No other state has done more to fill the vacuum left by Washington, D.C. and create a proving ground for climate policies that unite smart science and smart politics.\Just last year, California lawmakers agreed to raise the bar for clean electricity, demanding a 100 percent move to emissions-free power. It wasn't California's first leap forward, and it won't be our last. But the move was made possible by the fact that, as California reduced carbon emissions, we have also led the country in innovation, economic growth and job creation.\To succeed, advocates must reject the myth that green energy represents a move toward ""big government"" or higher costs. Fossil fuels, not renewables, are the largest recipients of subsidies in this country and abroad.\We have seen it work here in California, where the clean energy industry already supports more than 475,000 jobs — many in rural areas, representing solid, middle-class jobs that serve as anchors of the community.\To make it work, one thing we've learned is that cracking the code on greenhouse gas emissions requires more than zero-emissions electricity. As industrial emissions have fallen, transportation has emerged as the next great obstacle. To overcome the challenge, California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) complements the national Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) to support clean, homegrown biofuels for transportation. This has meant jobs for farmers, biorefinery workers, and other innovators transforming renewable feedstocks into clean alternatives for petroleum-based products.\Green energy jobs already outnumber fossil fuel jobs in 40 states.

73,"WASHINGTON -- Fortysix of the world's biggest corporations on Friday laid out their ""road map"" for reducing global warming, putting an emphasis on market-based ways to cut emissions. \""Climate change is a serious threat,"" said Peter Darbee, chairman and chief executive officer of PG&E Corp., a San Francisco-based energy company. ""The time for all of us to step up is now."" \Darbee and five other top executives held a news conference to announce the launch of Combat Climate Change (3C), an international business initiative that brings together corporate executives from North America, Europe, Asia and Africa. \The 3C initiative was launched to influence the environment ministers from 80 countries, including the United States, who will meet next month in Bali, Indonesia, to begin climate change negotiations. An existing agreement for emissions reductions, known as the Kyoto Protocol, will expire in 2012. \""We're committed to going to Bali and discussing with countries there the way ahead on climate change,"" Gordon Johndroe, spokesman for President Bush's National Security Council, said at a briefing Friday in Crawford, Texas. \The landmark Kyoto agreement assigned binding targets for 36 countries to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to global warming. The United States, Australia and many developing countries refused to ratify the Kyoto treaty, but are participating in discussions over the successor agreement. \Many business and environmental leaders believe the need for global action is growing as economic development spurs the use of fossil fuels. For example, demand for coal in China and India is expected to shoot up 73 percent between 2005 and 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. \The 3C group supports ""market-based"" solutions such as a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions. \A bipartisan bill approved this month by a Senate subcommittee is based on a similar approach. Under the bill, an overall cap would be set on emissions. Companies would get credits for the amount they were allowed to emit, and could trade or sell the credits among themselves. The cap would tighten over time, until by 2050, emissions would be reduced to 63 percent below 2005 levels. \Many Republicans oppose setting caps on emissions, while many environmentalists say the bill doesn't go far enough. \The 3C group is urging countries to agree to a global goal of a maximum acceptable temperature increase, and then set emissions caps derived from that goal."

77,"
POPE Francis, in an authoritative statement of Catholic Church doctrine, has aligned himself with the overwhelming scientific consensus on man-made climate change, affirming its reality and calling for immediate action to ease its effects. His remarks, in the encyclical ""Laudato Si,"" underscore the need for world leaders to face up to this grave challenge, and for all humans to be more-responsible stewards of Earth.
\
In his strongly worded document, Pope Francis said that the rich have polluted their way to prosperity at the expense of the poor. Global warming, he noted, has been primarily driven by carbon emissions in high-income countries, while its consequences - extreme weather events, diminished food supplies, and political instability - will be felt most in poor countries.
\
Nations must develop a coordinated plan of action to address the problem, he asserted, and also advance a ""bold cultural revolution"" to change how people interact with nature and one another.
\
In a meeting with The Blade's editorial board, Bishop Daniel Thomas of the Diocese of Toledo stressed that the Pope's message on climate change must be understood in terms of this ""integral ecology."" The Pope links neglect of the Earth with social ills such as child abuse and abandonment of the elderly, Bishop Thomas observed.
\
To Pope Francis, these problems are part of a ""throwaway culture"" that leaves people and the environment behind in the name of supposed technological progress, unbridled consumerism, and selfish personal desires.
\
The Pope's stand won him no friends on the right. Republican presidential candidates Jeb Bush and Rick Santorum urged the Pope to focus on individual moral guidance and leave the political matters to - well, people like them.
\
But Americans' spiritual beliefs have often spurred them to fight for a more just, inclusive society. And Mr. Bush and Mr. Santorum have invoked Catholic doctrine to explain their opposition to abortion and euthanasia.
\
Even to sympathetic readers, the Pope's attacks on capitalism may seem excessive. His observations on modern technology and social organization sometimes are reminiscent of Cold War-era doomsday prophecy. His contempt for cap-and-trade, a plan that would allow polluters to exchange permits to emit set amounts of carbon, rankles scientists and policy wonks who see it as a possible solution to the climate crisis.
\
But no one should expect the Pope, or any other individual, to have all the answers. Baruch Spinoza, the 17th century philosopher of religion, wrote that the most important role of any faith tradition is to lead individuals to universal moral truths. With his new encyclical, Pope Francis has done that, bringing greater attention to the danger that global warming poses to humanity's common home.

78,"""Clean coal."" Sounds great, doesn't it? \Renewable energy -- wind, solar, geothermal -- requires big new investments and threatens the jobs of people in West Virginia and Ohio who work in the coal industry. \But the old fossil fuels are dirty and otherwise threatening to the environment. Most specifically, coal gives off carbon dioxide that is linked to global warming by the overwhelming majority in the scientific community. \So how should society choose between the old and new forms of energy? \Cleaning up the coal sounds perfect. (Well, almost perfect. It does still leave the coal industry changing the face of Appalachia, to the distress of many.) \But money is a problem. The coal industry -- though it provides half the electricity in this county -- can't afford all the needed research. \The government has put up $3.4 billion through the federal stimulus. There was also government money in the 1980s. Now there's talk of more. \Some environmentalists are skeptical about whether affordable clean coal is achievable. But some credible scientists say the effort is starting to come together. \Now Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, is joining with Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia, to propose $20 billion in federal spending over the next decade, combined with industry money, to develop a way to burn coal cleanly and make money doing it. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, also says he's interested. \To their credit, the sponsors provide a source of funding in their legislation, rather than just adding the cost to the deficit. They'd put a fee on utility bills. That helps sustain Sen. Voinovich's cherished reputation as a ""deficit hawk."" Whether it helps pass the legislation is another question. \A similar approach didn't help the health care bill get any Republican votes. And there's going to be opposition to what amounts to a tax. \The two sponsors say that a sweeping energy bill that has been much talked about in Washington -- sometimes referred to as ""cap and trade"" or ""Kerry-Lieberman"" -- is dead. That effort is designed to limit the release of carbon into the atmosphere by aiming incentives and punishments at emitters. \Sens. Voinovich and Rockefeller say the death of the bigger idea should not mean the death of carbon-related legislation. \But some ask: Why put money into a dying industry using an exhaustible resource when there are clean and inexhaustible alternatives? \Of course, renewable forms of energy are getting government aid, too, including $16.6 billion in the stimulus. Indeed, the stimulus has been widely sold as promoting the country's move to cleaner energy. \The case for an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to our energy future has much to be said for it. So long as the coal companies are not digging in their heels against change -- not insisting the old ways are good enough -- they should have a place in the discussion and a shot at some money. \However, Washington should be focused on a passing a larger bill. If the coal industry gets what it wants in a piecemeal way, that will affect its attitude toward the larger bill. Best to keep the research money at bay, in hopes of putting a coalition together for a more systematic approach."
79,"
TWO days from now, Americans will go to the polls in what is arguably the most important election in generations. It behooves them to approach their task, electing the next president of the United States, with seriousness and objectivity, rejecting appeals to emotion in favor of calm deliberation as if their jobs, their savings, their futures, their hopes, and their dreams were at stake. Indeed, for many Americans, that may well be the case.
\
America is beset by serious, systemic economic problems for which solutions must be found. At the same time, the United States faces an often unfriendly world that is being transformed as surely by the emergence of China and India as economic competitors as it is by the growth of terrorist ideologies. And it is involved in two wars that could further destabilize two critical regions, the Middle East and the Asian subcontinent.
\
The next president will have to have the energy, stamina, vision, resolve, and yes, the charisma to deal with these problems, plus global warming, dependence on foreign oil, a crumbling national infrastructure, rising medical costs, growing numbers of uninsured, the prospect of a bankrupt Medicare system, and a host of other issues. He will have to inspire confidence in the American people while still making tough choices that may require sacrifices.
\
Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan were leaders uniquely suited to their times. Like them, the next president will have to be a unique individual who can help America chart a new course through these uncertain times. As we said in our initial endorsement on Oct. 12, Barack Obama is that man.
\
Mr. Obama rightly advocates greater regulation of the financial institutions whose reckless practices largely led to the nation's economic woes. He'll push for a $50 billion stimulus package that will put the money where it can do the most good, creating 1 million jobs to repair America's aging roads, bridges, dams, and railways and helping local governments avoid cuts in basic services. He also wants to help struggling home-
\
owners stay in their houses by allowing them to restructure their mortgages.
\
Mr. Obama has promised to cut income taxes for 95 percent of all Americans, putting money in their pockets to help the middle class get through these difficult times. He'll promote ""green"" jobs and eliminate capital gains taxes for investments made in small businesses. And he has called for legislation to allow families to withdraw part of their 401(k) savings without penalty during this crisis as well as for a temporary lifting of taxes on unemployment compensation to help tide people over.
\
Mr. Obama has promised new directions in education, emphasizing early childhood education and rewarding expert teachers; the environment, where he advocates a broad cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and wants the United States to lead the world in alternative-energy technology and the effort to combat global warming, and the war on terror, where he has long recognized that Afghanistan, not Iraq, should have been the focus of U.S. counterterrorism policy.
\
John McCain has had 20 months to convince voters that he is capable of leading America in the 21st century. He has failed to close the deal, mostly because of his inability to show that he has a vision coherent enough, forward-thinking enough, global enough to answer the summons of which Kennedy spoke in his inaugural address 47 years ago: ""not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are - but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, 'rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation' - a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.""
\
Mr. Obama is ready to answer that summons. He deserves your vote on Tuesday and your support in the years beyond.

JACKSON TWP. -- President Obama's energy secretary is convinced the world will need a new industrial revolution, and he believes the United States can lead it.
\
Department of Energy Secretary Steven Chu joined U.S. Rep. John Boccieri and others at Stark State College of Technology to hear what universities and businesses were doing in research and development efforts to promote alternative energies. Chu also spoke about $25 million in stimulus money Ohio was receiving from his agency for energy efficiency.
\
Chu said he hopes efforts to make homes more efficient through weatherization will lead to lower energy costs for owners, a reduction in energy usage and an increase in new jobs.
\
The new industrial revolution is needed to give the country a cleaner energy, Chu said. He discovered on a recent trip to China leaders there are trying to develop renewable energy sources, like wind and solar, and construct distribution lines.
\
Chu said he believes what is happening in China can be a money maker, and there is no way he wants to concede high-tech innovation to the country. He wants the research, development and innovation to happen here. Chu said he has seen some of those initiatives in Ohio, including fuel cell technology and wind turbine generation.
\
The retrofitting homes to be more energy efficient will take 30-40 years, Chu said, and he believes it will be an opportunity to create new wealth.
\
Though this country has lost the global lead in wind generation, civilian nuclear technology and automotive manufacturing, Chu said it needs to work to get it back. Places like Ohio will at the center of it, he added.
\
Though Chu initially was skeptical about climate change, he said he now considers it a serious challenge. He urged attendees to contact their senators to support climate change legislation.
\
For Boccieri, who voted for the cap-and-trade legislation, the issue was not the environment, but national security, he said.
\
""The cheapest energy is the energy we never use,"" said Boccieri, who believes this country can become energy efficient within 20 years.
\
Dave Benfield, associate director of Ohio State University's Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center, and Jeff Griffin, president of the Wooster Area Chamber of Commerce, were part of the roundtable discussion.
\
While there is a lot of competition in Big Ten football, Griffin said there is a lot of competition with research, too. Though he told Chu he would not say it publicly, he would gladly trade a national championship in football for jobs in the BioHio Research Park on the campus of OARDC.
\
Benfield talked about OARDC's research in bio-based products and renewable energy sources. One of the projects in is Schmack BioEnergy, which is constructing a demonstration facility in the BioHio park. It converts waste into energy through the use of digesters. Benfield said Schmack should be able to generate about one-third of the energy OARDC uses.
\
Ohio is 11th in the country with the amount of biomass, and it is in the Top 5 in the amount of food waste produced. It is to the country's advantage to take that waste and convert it to energy or value-added products, Benfield said.
\
Scientists from OARDC are also working with the Russian dandelion to develop a domestic source of rubber. It has the potential to create 165 jobs, Benfield said.
\
Chu said later he does not know the details of OARDC's research, but agricultural resources have the capacity to grow food and energy, especially if agricultural waste can be convered.
\
Earlier in the day, former U.S. Rep. Ralph Regula was recognized for the work he did in Congress to make the Defense Metals Technology Center at Stark State a reality. Regula also attended the roundtable discussion and met privately with Chu following the event.

'Socialized' program gets bad wrap
\
Editor:
\
If ""ignorance is bliss"" then Mr. Brooks of Ashland must be extremely happy.
\
What he wrote in a letter to The Daily Record on July 21 is an example of his ignorance. He's worried about the U.S. going ""socialized,"" but we have had social programs for years. They include unemployment compensation, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and others. Without these programs we would all be thrown back to the '30s.
\
Having lived in and visited other countries that have a national health system, the people on the NHS live longer and are healthier and although there are problems with some systems (as with ours), just try to take it away from them.
\
In talking with them, they are all covered and would not want our system the way it is now. Another plus for them is their employer doesn't have to cover them or pay for it. They also have a choice of being on the NHS or going with a private insurance.
\
A survey shows the V.A. (a government-run health service) gives the best care of all. AS it should.
\
I wonder if Mr. Brooks will go on Social Security and Medicare when the time comes?
\
Also, I'm surprised The Daily Record hasn't heard from those nut jobs who claim our president wasn't born in the U.S.

Need smaller, not bigger government
\
Editor:
\
All that I've been reading the last several months does not sound good for this country that was once founded on Biblical principles. And no wonder since God and the Bible were thrown out of schools years ago. As a result morality is not in style these days.
\
In all that I say I mean no disrespect for President Obama even though I don't agree with him.
\
In my recollection of studying government in school, Congress was supposed to make the laws and the president and his cabinet were supposed to see them carried out, called the Executive Branch. Now it sounds as if President Obama is trying to force his thinking into laws and forcing them through Congress.
\
Government has already taken over most automakers, many banks and now is trying to take over the health insurance companies. We already have too much government control. It should get smaller instead of bigger.
\
Cap and trade makes no common sense at all. It will not help the environment and will take what little money poorer people have and shift it to the already rich people.
\
Is there hope for this great nation of ours? There is if we do like is written in the Bible in 2 Chronicles 7:14 -- If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and will heal their land.

Wind use prospectson the rise
\
Editor:
\
As remarked in the August issue of Popular Science, high-voltage electric towers may soon produce as well as conduct electricity. The brainchild of two French architects, this so-called ""Wind-It"" design incorporates a vertical wind turbine within the familiar steeple-like framework.
\
Although large wind farms presuppose many acres of windswept land, these coupled contrivances could be erected along the tens of thousands of miles already devoted to overhead high-voltage wires in this country.
\
Presently, industrialists are sought to transform the scale model into the 330-foot high structure that computer simulations suggest could generate ample electricity.
\
The Great Plains will certainly require more power lines in the near future. Wind turbines set within high-voltage towers would ideally catch and use the ceaseless prairie winds.

82,"AS atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide continue to increase, pundits have been quick to pronounce the end of coal. Some have even declared that our nation's economy would benefit if power plants that use coal are shut down.\Nothing could be further from the truth. Coal is America's main source of energy, providing 52 percent of the nation's electricity and 86 percent of energy in Ohio. The current emission problems, however, require immediate attention to insure the continued advancement of clean-coal technology and its use in the U.S. and throughout the world.\For the past 25 years, U.S. power plants have been producing more electricity from the same amount of coal, while reducing sulfur-dioxide emissions by 40 percent and nitrogen oxides by 44 percent, resulting in significantly lower levels of acid rain and smog.\These successes have been fostered by strong industry and government support for clean-coal research and development, which in turn has become a real stimulus for improving the environment.\Federal matching grants for research and development have made possible a high and increasing level of investment, most of which has been put to good use in areas such as improving coal-combustion efficiency and developing supercritical boilers and coal gasification systems.\Recent developments, however, underscore the challenges presented by growing public concern about climate change. Coal plants account for 40 percent of U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, causing environmental alarmists such as Al Gore and NASA climatologist James Hansen to mount emotional arguments against construction of new coal plants - and even calling for the shut down of existing plants. The attacks against coal have created political strain. That has been worsened by two external developments.\First, there has been growing worldwide demand for coal, which has opened up opportunities for increased U.S. coal production and exports to other countries. This is exacerbating the carbon problem. As a result, pressure is mounting for greater use of natural gas and nuclear energy as alternative sources of base-load electricity.\In addition, both Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama are calling for controls on carbon-dioxide emissions from coal plants and other sources.\For years, McCain has spearheaded efforts in Congress to adopt a cap-and-trade system for carbon reduction. But the danger in this approach is that if it were adopted before technology for carbon capture-and-storage becomes available, utilities would be inclined to switch from coal to natural gas. Consumers would wind up paying substantially more for electricity, businesses and factories would close and tens of thousands of jobs would be lost.\Consequently, our emphasis should not be on regulating carbon-dioxide but on pursuing a practical and affordable way to sequester carbon-dioxide emissions in underground geological formations.\Once developed, the technology for carbon storage could be exported to other countries such as China and India that burn huge amounts of coal.\As a study on carbon capture-and-storage by energy experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded, it is ""the critical enabling technology that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions significantly while also allowing coal to meet the world's pressing energy needs.""\Developing this technology on a timely basis would cast coal in an entirely new light, reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and open up huge possibilities for the continued use of coal in the U.S. and throughout the world, with economic benefits.\(Community Voices features columns about local issues written by a selection of Eagle-Gazette writers and readers.

From the trenches of World War I to the skies over Vietnam, chemical weapons have a long, ugly history in the 20th century. It's good that in the 21st, they may become a thing of the past.
\
Speaking last week in Slovenia, the United Nations' Ahmet Uzumcu, director-general of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, announced that 90 percent of global stockpiles have been eliminated under existing treaty obligations. He added that the United States and Russia -- the biggest keepers of these deadly substances -- will destroy their Cold War-era supplies over the next decade.
\
With this news, a future of safer, more humane warfare seems possible, and much of the credit rests with OPCW, which won the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize for its work.
\
Obstacles remain, though, to a world free of chemical weapons. An OPCW report suggests that Syria's Assad regime might have used chlorine gas against rebels last year, and this despite the agency's inspection and removal efforts there. Six countries -- Angola, Egypt, Israel, Myanmar, North Korea and South Sudan -- have not ratified the treaty that forbids chemical weapons, and it is probable that some of them possess undisclosed stockpiles.
\
Last week's announcement nevertheless confirms substantial progress toward the abolition of chemical weapons. No one knows if the lamb will ever lie down with the lion. But until then, the world should work toward eliminating the most horrifying forms of armed conflict.

It's a shame that Sen. Lindsey Graham, who on Monday joined the burgeoning field of Republican presidential candidates, is best known for his foreign-policy stands. Graham's blunt pronouncements on national security can tend to careen between humor and bluster, to the point that it can be hard to know if the senator from South Carolina -- let alone his audience -- gets his own jokes.
\
Under a President Graham, he recently told a Republican audience in Iowa, any American who even thinks of joining Islamic State would be marked for extrajudicial execution. ""I'm gonna call a drone, and we're gonna kill you,"" he said.
\
That was a joke. Right?
\
Graham's ballistic foreign-policy routine attracts attention, but it's his pragmatism in domestic affairs that merits a larger audience. He provided a rare Republican vote confirming U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch in April, and was an unflinching supporter of the bipartisan immigration reform that passed the Senate in 2013. Just as important, Graham seems disinclined to back away from reform now that he's running for president.
\
Grasping the threat posed by carbon pollution, he backed a cap-and-trade initiative to establish a market for greenhouse-gas emission credits. ""From a biblical point of view, we were counseled by God to be good stewards of the environment,"" he said recently.
\
Neither climate change policy nor immigration reform has been an especially high priority for many South Carolina Republicans. But Graham backed the proposals, reached out to make deals with senators in both parties and trusted he could sell the merits to his constituents. That's leadership.
\
Whether it's the kind of leadership his party seeks in 2016 remains to be seen. ...
\
Graham's qualitative assessment was largely on the mark. That his timing was off -- both the tea party and the ideological rigidity it champions remain potent forces in Republican politics -- may be the biggest obstacle to his presidential ambitions.

WOOSTER -- Voters in Ohio's 16th District have shown a distaste for change over the past six decades, having been represented by Republicans Frank Bow for 21 years and Ralph Regula for 36, but they gave Democrat John Boccieri just two.
\
Republican Jim Renacci, former mayor of Wadsworth and entrepreneur, will be the next congressman to represent the district come January. He received 52.8 percent of the vote, with Boccieri receiving 40.3 percent and Jeffrey Blevins, a Libertarian, receiving 6.7 percent. Dr. Bob Ross, a write-in candidate, received 0.06 percent of the vote.
\
Renacci ran on his business experience, promising to cut taxes, repeal and replace health care reform and work to create a climate of predictability and certainty for business owners to help spur job creation.
\
""I am deeply humbled tonight to have earned the honor to serve as our district's voice in Washington,"" Renacci said. ""While this was a hard fought campaign, the real heavy lifting begins now as we move ahead and begin to tackle the great many challenges that face our country and our state. I thank and congratulate Congressman Boccieri for his service to our country, and after this tough and spirited campaign, I greatly look forward to getting to work in Washington on behalf of this great community.""
\
Obviously, the Republicans made strong gains across the country,"" Boccieri said. ""People want balanced government. The folks were scared and anxious.""
\
The special interest groups trying to affect the outcome of the election didn't help either, he said.
\
As to whether his votes in support of health care reform and a cap-and-trade initiative led to his defeat, Boccieri said he had no regrets with his votes and believes history will show they were the correct decisions.
\
Boccieri said he is not sure what the next chapter in his life will be, but for now he will spend more time with his family. He and his wife had their fifth child Saturday, a baby girl named Emma. He will make a career decision once his term is completed.
\
James Slepian, Renacci's campaign manager, said for months internal polling showed Boccieri trailing by between 6 and 10 percentage points.
\
""The numbers held strong in June, July, August, September and even 10 days ago,"" Slepian said. ""A lot of people made up their minds a long time ago.""
\
Renacci's victory helped the Republicans regained a majority in the House of Representatives and made gains in the Senate.
\
The mood at the Wayne County Republican Party Headquarters was ""superb"" and the feeling, compared to 2008, was ""wonderful,"" Chairman Jim Smail said.
\
""The country is in need of a change and the returns are showing that,"" Smail said. ""The Democratic administration had two years at the helm of the ship, and the passengers of the ship are not happy with the ride.
\
""I think we are experiencing that sweep that was predicted.""
\
""I think there has been a strong voice being spoken on part of the electorate,"" said David Broehl, chairman of the Wayne County Democratic Party. ""Two years ago, people talked about change, and the pendulum swung. Two years later, people have talked about change, and the pendulum swung the other way.""
\
Voters have shown they have less patience, Broehl said. ""I will be curious to see that pendulum in a couple of years.""
\
When voters elected Barack Obama as president in 2008, he campaigned on the themes of hope and change.
\
However, people are now looking to Republicans to provide change.
\
""In the next two years, the Republicans will have to govern and not be the 'party of no,'"" Broehl said.
\
""He's correct,"" Smail said of Broehl's assessment.
\
If Republicans make the same mistake they did in past, then this victory will be short-lived, Slepian said. However, he believes this crop of Republicans elected to office ""get it.""
\
The biggest challenge facing the next Congress will be to turn the economy around and provide an environment for job creation. However, Smail said the change will not come overnight.

86,"A Green New Deal is taking shape, and it has captured the energy and enthusiasm of a new generation of voters who care deeply about sustaining the environment for ourselves and future generations.\The movement could very well represent a watershed moment in U.S. history, as opposition to common-sense climate policies crumbles under the weight of clear and compelling science. Or we could find ourselves replaying painful memories of earth-friendly proposals like the Kyoto Protocols and cap-and-trade legislation that crashed into the realities of American politics, leaving advocates to pick up the pieces.\Based on the latest United Nations report, we may not get another opportunity to change course before the most devastating impacts of climate change become inescapable. That's why we need to make sure this effort succeeds. As dynamic new leaders focus on a national Green New Deal, I hope they take a hard look at the lessons available in California.\No other state has done more to fill the vacuum left by Washington, D.C. and create a proving ground for climate policies that unite smart science and smart politics.\Just last year, California lawmakers agreed to raise the bar for clean electricity, demanding a 100 percent move to emissions-free power. It wasn't California's first leap forward, and it won't be our last. But the move was made possible by the fact that, as California reduced carbon emissions, we have also led the country in innovation, economic growth and job creation.\To succeed, advocates must reject the myth that green energy represents a move toward ""big government"" or higher costs. Fossil fuels, not renewables, are the largest recipients of subsidies in this country and abroad.\We have seen it work here in California, where the clean energy industry already supports more than 475,000 jobs — many in rural areas, representing solid, middle-class jobs that serve as anchors of the community.\To make it work, one thing we've learned is that cracking the code on greenhouse gas emissions requires more than zero-emissions electricity. As industrial emissions have fallen, transportation has emerged as the next great obstacle. To overcome the challenge, California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) complements the national Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) to support clean, homegrown biofuels for transportation. This has meant jobs for farmers, biorefinery workers, and other innovators transforming renewable feedstocks into clean alternatives for petroleum-based products.\Green energy jobs already outnumber fossil fuel jobs in 40 states. While the opponents try to make the bold solutions proposed in a Green New Deal sound extreme, California has shown that we can reduce emissions, create jobs for working families, and build a future-oriented economy that will lift people up.\George Miller (D-CA), the former chairman of the U.S. House Education and Labor Committee, is a member of the board of advisors of New Energy America, a non-profit organization dedicated to policies that support clean energy jobs in rural America.\George Miller\Columnist\CREDIT: Christopher Balusik"

WASHINGTON - Any time a bipartisan group of senators sits down with the president to talk about climate-change legislation, there is the promise of progress on the issue of limiting greenhouse-gas emissions, says Sen. Sherrod Brown.
\
But President Barack Obama will need to weigh in with more specifics than he delivered yesterday if a bill that will put a price on carbon emissions has a chance of passing this year, the Ohio Democrat said.
\
Brown was among nearly two dozen senators from both parties who met with Obama at the White House to talk again about how to formulate a bill that will pump money and resources into so-called clean energy investments and limit carbon emissions by power plants and manufacturers.
\
GOP Sen. George V. Voinovich of Ohio emphasized his desire for ""energy legislation"" that includes expanded nuclear power and more money for clean-coal technology.
\
While many people of both parties want a final climate-change measure this year, there also are many ideas about what should be in that bill, Brown said.
\
Last year, the House passed a climate-change bill that penalizes carbon emissions, but Brown and Voinovich are not yet backing a similar Senate measure introduced this year by Sens. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.
\
Voinovich, a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, said the meeting ""sent a clear signal to the president, Sen. Kerry and Sen. Lieberman that the chances of passing their cap-and-trade legislation are quite slim.""
\
During a conference call with reporters after the meeting, Brown said, ""The president is going to need to be more specific at some point on what he wants and what he thinks this institution can deliver.""
\
Brown is part of a key group of coal-state Democrats who are withholding support from a climate-change bill, though he insisted yesterday that he agrees with Obama's contention that ""polluters"" must pay for excessive carbon emissions.
\
Brown is pushing for a $30billion federal revolving-loan fund to help manufacturers retool existing factories to produce clean-energy products such as solar panels and wind turbines.
\
Brown supports Obama's call to tax carbon emissions that exceed certain levels - creating a ""price on carbon"" - but he says such a tax must not push manufacturers to move jobs out of states, including Ohio, that derive most of their electricity from coal-fired power plants.
\
Both Brown and Voinovich want to make sure that any carbon-emissions taxes imposed by a domestic climate-change bill are matched with provisions requiring other countries either to have the same emissions limits or face import fees for products made with cheaper, dirtier power.
\
The White House account of the meeting said Obama told the senators he ""still believes the best way for us to transition to a clean-energy economy is with a bill that makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy for America's businesses by putting a price on pollution."" But the White House acknowledged: ""Not all of the senators agreed with this approach.""
\
Brown also released a report yesterday showing that the state has received more than $889 million in stimulus money for various projects.
\
But Ryan Tronovitch, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said in a statement, ""Sherrod Brown's latest lame attempt to resell the 'Recovery Act' as a success won't sit well with the almost 128,000 Ohioans who are still out of work.""

Not long after she was named to lead Duke Energy's operations in Ohio and Kentucky, Julie Janson started getting requests to join civic and community boards. But she was deliberately choosy.
\
""I wanted those that would give me a catbird seat so I could inject myself into what's going on,"" she says.
\
Now, from her seat atop two of the biggest economic development groups in town, Janson is working to save existing jobs as well as bring new work and business to Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky.
\
In August, she was named chair of the Cincinnati USA Regional Partnership, the economic development arm of the Cincinnati chamber of commerce. She also co-chairs the economic development task force of the Cincinnati Business Committee, a group that includes the chief executives of some of Cincinnati's largest companies.
\
Those volunteer roles dovetail with the position she assumed a year ago as president of Duke Energy Ohio and Kentucky. There, her assignment includes bringing more of what utility professionals call ""load,"" the power consumed by homes and businesses, to Duke's service territory.
\
""This is my day job, trying to bring economic development and 'load' to the region,"" she says.
\
She is starting from a deficit, as power load is off 15 to 17 percent, largely due to the shrinking economy of the past two years. Few companies are looking to expand, which has led to a shift in strategy to focus on keeping the jobs already here.
\
""In this economic environment, you have to look at retention first,"" she says. ""You have to take care of home base first.""
\
That means visiting CEOs and leaders of local operations to find out what they need to stay healthy, furthering the strategy of creating ""clusters"" of like-minded industries and supporting the work of organizations such as the Center City Development Corp., which is rehabbing the city's most blighted neighborhood, Over-the-Rhine.
\
It includes chairing the 2010 Fine Arts Fund, a post she sees as also related to economic development. ""It's part of attracting business to this region,"" she says, ""the health and wellness of the arts.""
\
'Wicked smart'
\
The region is home base for Janson. She grew up here, graduating from Beechwood High School in Fort Mitchell in 1982, then Georgetown (Ky.) College and the University of Cincinnati College of Law.
\
Her career with the utility dates to the Cincinnati Gas & Electric days, when she was a corporate lawyer. In that role, she performed due diligence on the merger of CG&E with Indiana's PSI Energy, the union that created Cinergy Corp. She was appointed corporate secretary and chief compliance officer for Cinergy, and then worked on the next transformative merger of the power company, with North Carolina's Duke Energy.
\
Last December, she was named to lead Duke's Ohio and Kentucky operations, formerly CG&E and Union Heat Light & Power, which serve 825,000 customers in Southwest Ohio and Northern Kentucky.
\
Her boss at Duke, Jim Turner, calls her ""wicked smart,"" someone who's ""good at bringing people and constituencies together."" She's also a natural to further the economic development work here, he says.
\
""The role of the president of the local utility is an ideal one to take an active part in economic development,"" says Turner, president of Duke's regulated businesses, which include the Ohio and Kentucky operations.
\
Doug Moormann, president of the Cincinnati USA Regional Partnership, agrees. ""It's not just a civic commitment for her,"" he says. ""This is really core to her job.""
\
Time to brag
\
Although she's a native of the region and has worked most of her life here, Janson spent five years working at Duke headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., commuting the 500 miles to her home in Fort Mitchell. That experience influenced her views on how a region's image affects the success of its development efforts.
\
Charlotte is a region that Cincinnati leaders have aspired to be more like, as it was once termed a ""gazelle city"" for the fast growth of its economy. Habitually modest Cincinnatians could learn a lesson from citizens of that Southern town, she says.
\
""They are not a humble group,"" she says of Charlotte. ""They are quick to tell you about it.""
\
""We've been pretty humble; it's time for us to brag a little bit.""
\
When she pitches the region she brags about its location within 500 miles of half the nation's population, its relatively low cost of power, its transportation network of air, freeways, barge and rail, the affordable cost of living and the work ethic of its residents.
\
As a leader of a coal-burning power company that is deregulating and on the verge of transition, she's bracing for change.
\
""The change that's going to happen in the next five or 10 years will be as dramatic as the change in the last 100 years,"" she says. That's largely because innovation has been slow in the power industry, a sector that traditionally has been heavily regulated, and still is in some states.
\
She's followed the lead of Duke CEO Jim Rogers in arguing for cap-and-trade legislation with allowances or permits to emit greenhouse gases, but is realistic about the impact.
\
""Environmental regulation will make energy more expensive for our customers,"" she says.

With the G-20 over in Pittsburgh and attention being shifted toward the world's most historic climate change negotiations in Copenhagen in December, I can't get the headline that appeared in The Blade last Tuesday above Thomas Friedman's column out of my head.
\
A Nation of Wimps.
\
Are we?
\
From health care to Afghanistan, we've got hard choices in front of us.
\
But when haven't we?
\
In his speech at the United Nations on Tuesday - one poorly covered by the media - President Obama said there ""should be no illusions that the hardest part of our journey is in front of us.""
\
""We seek sweeping but necessary change in the midst of a global recession, where every nation's most immediate priority is reviving their economy and putting their people back to work. And so all of us will face doubts and difficulties in our own capitals as we try to reach a lasting solution to the climate challenge,"" he said.
\
Industrialized countries such as the United States must step up as leaders, Mr. Obama said.
\
""What we are seeking, after all, is not simply an agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions. We seek an agreement that will allow all nations to grow and raise living standards without endangering the planet,"" he said.
\
America was built on innovation. On integrity. On sacrifice.
\
Are we sticking our heads in the sand? Or are we just not up to one of Earth's most historic challenges?
\
The sheer concept of providing basic health care to those unable to afford it has the nation up in arms, as if we are a bunch of bratty kids being told to give up our video games.
\
Truth is, most people don't like the status quo for health care but are just too scared to change it. The lengthy debate over it has already stalled cap-and-trade discussions in the Senate and more than likely deflated hopes for meaningful climate negotiations in Copenhagen.
\
Yet two puzzling items came across my desk on Sept. 16.
\
One was a statement from the International Investor Forum on Climate Change, sponsored by the New York state comptroller and others with ties to the financial community, including a coalition of investor-based environmental groups called Ceres. It said a joint investor statement calling for action on climate change had been released by 181 investors managing more than $13 trillion in assets, a group it billed as the world's largest collection of global investors.
\
That same day, a French wire service agency reported that 18 colleges of physicians or academies of medicine from the United States, Australia, Britain, Canada, Ireland, Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Ireland, and South Africa made a joint appeal for a breakthrough in Copenhagen.
\
The physician groups claimed that failing to get serious about climate change would be ""catastrophic"" for public health, citing the prospect of greater drought and a wider spread of mosquito-borne diseases.
\
In the past, military experts have explained how climate change could affect national security. And, of course, climatologists - the ones we should have been listening to all along - have been pretty firm about what inaction could mean.
\
Yet we're gonna muddle and muck things up. On Wednesday, the National Association of Manufacturers, led by former Michigan Gov. John Engler, supported calls for a Republican-led Senate moratorium on letting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.
\
Moving too quickly ""would only impose overly burdensome compliance costs on the manufacturing sector and limit their ability to deploy advanced technologies,"" Jay Timmons, the association's executive vice president, said.
\
A lot's at stake for the Great Lakes region.
\
On Thursday, the University of Michigan announced a major initiative to map public health threats to the Great Lakes. One goal will be to account for the impact of climate change already under way, according to David Allan, a professor of aquatic sciences at the UM school of natural resources and environment.
\
Good-bye to One Great Lady: I spent only one day in the life of 85-year-old Betty Jo Carstensen, but what a memorable one it was. She was like a little kid when we quietly tip-toed through her own little piece of paradise in eastern Lucas County in the fall of 2004, looking for wildlife in a beautiful 35-acre forest she had carved out of the 135-acre farm she and her late husband, Bill, had owned since 1958.
\
Betty died Sept. 5. When I saw her obituary, my heart sunk. Eighty-five years is a good life for most of us - but for someone as spry as Betty, she was in her prime as an educator and environmental steward.
\
She was a member of the Oregon school board since 1993 and a tutor to countless children. As a lover of land, she followed her husband's footsteps on to the Lucas Soil and Water Conservation District's board of directors, continuing on with work he began as a founding supervisor in 1965.
\
The Ohio Department of Natural Resources lauded her commitment to forestry, especially on her own property. She made sure that every Oregon child had a tree to plant in the spring.
\
And when the time came for her and her husband to put their five kids through college, the couple avoided the temptation of clear-cutting their land and farming every square inch they could.
\
Instead, they sold pickles.
\
Pickles.
\
""I tell you what - we didn't get any new furniture for a while,"" she mused during my 2004 interview.
\
Good for them.

Who among us hasn't spent a date night fighting over the merits of a renewed cap and trade act?
\
You haven't? Yeah, neither have we. But that doesn't mean politics haven't been seeping into our relationships in ways big and small, especially in an election-year climate as divisive and colorful as this one.
\
The ""Single in America Study"" of more than 5,000 U.S. singles age 21 to 65 looked at, among other things, the role of political leanings in dating and found that our voting habits are frequently reflected in our love lives --in the type of partners we seek out and how we conduct ourselves within those partnerships.
\
While only 17 percent of men and 20 percent of women said a partner with the same party affiliations is a ""must have,"" the findings suggest singles may do some self-selecting that falls along party lines, even if unintentionally.
\
Self-described liberal Democrats, for example, place the highest priority on finding a partner who ""treats them with respect,"" ""has a sense of humor,"" and ""is comfortable with sexuality,"" according to the study, which was sponsored by Match.com and conducted by biological anthropologist Helen Fisher and relationship therapist Laura Berman. Republicans' top priorities are ""shares the same values,"" ""has the same view on money,"" and ""is the same religion.""
\
Democratic men consider it a turn-on ""if a date is opinionated."" Self-described conservative Republican men consider it a turn-on ""if a date dresses conservatively"" and a turn-off ""if a date has many guy friends,"" while moderate Republican men consider it a turn-on ""if a date is career-driven.""
\
""If you look at brain chemistry research, there are a lot of both nature and nurture underpinnings to one's political viewpoints,"" says Ms. Berman. ""If you're raised in a certain environment, taught certain things, lived in a certain community, maybe you tend to be more of a rebel or risk taker, maybe you tend to be more conservative.""
\
In other words, our political views, at some point, blend together to become our world views.
\
Which is partly why, say relationship experts, it's next to impossible to keep politics out of the picture -- ""even if you're not sitting down and saying, 'What are your views on abortion, contraception, and gun rights?'"" says Judith Kuriansky, a psychologist on the faculty of Columbia University Teachers College and author of The Complete Idiot's Guide to Dating (Alpha). ""Political discussions have bled into people's dating lives in such a big way -- where they stand on the economy, taxes, Social Security, social services.""
\
Ms. Kuriansky attributes the seepage to a dating population that's older and more politically aware than ever, but also to the general economic malaise gripping much of the nation.
\
""Across all ages and relationships more people than ever are sitting in counseling discussing what's happening in the world and where the world is going,"" she says. ""The life stresses have created a real psychological depression about the economy, about the future, and about the present.""
\
Indeed, singles in the study listed the economy as the No. 1 source of stress in their lives. (Though 60 percent said it hasn't changed their dating habits and 40 percent said they would date someone who was unemployed.)
\
""People are so aware of how much money they have now, how much they're going to have later, and what kind of life they are able to have,"" says Ms. Kuriansky. ""Money is so much in the forefront of people's minds.
\
""You can barely find a kid from the middle class who's not worried about having enough money to date and marry and still pay off his college debt.""
\
Perhaps a single president could provide a welcome distraction from the economic malaise: Eighty-seven to 94 percent of all political groups are ""open to having a single president,"" while 79 percent of conservative Republicans and 91 percent of liberal Democrats are open to him or her dating while in office.
\
How about a president who's dating while married in office?
\
Not so fast. Eighty-seven percent of men and 91 percent of women said there are ""no acceptable excuses"" for infidelity in a political candidate. In their own lives, 62 percent of men and 80 percent of women say sexual fidelity in a relationship is a ""must have.""
\
""It's much easier to hold others to ideals that we don't hold ourselves to,"" says Ms. Berman. ""And with politicians, it's not so much that he cheated per se, as much as that he's capable of cheating and lying and dishonesty and deceptions. And we don't want to think that about our country's leaders.""
\
The take-away from all of this?
\
""The way you affiliate yourself does lead to a lot more than how you vote,"" says Ms. Kuriansky. ""It affects your social views and ideas on more than just the hot-button issues that create problems for people.""
\
Ultimately, though, she'd like to see couples use politicians as a bad example of how to conduct relationships.
\
""We see what's happening in Congress, where the members can't even cross the aisle,"" she says. ""And our divisions are getting worse than ever.""
\
Better for all parties -- political and otherwise -- to seek some middle ground.
\
""You'll have a harder time walking down the aisle,"" she laughs, ""if you never learn to cross the aisle.""
\
MORE FROM THE SINGLES STUDY
\
Roughly 43 percent of Americans over age 18 are single, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The second annual Single in America Study asked 5,000 of them, ages 21 to 65, about a wide range of topics. (The study was commissioned in conjunction with sex and relationship expert Laura Berman and biological anthropologist Helen Fisher, chief scientific adviser for match.com.)
\
Some highlights:
\
? A majority of singles admitted to having a one-night stand, with 66 percent of libertarians, 65 percent of liberal Democrats, and 49 percent of conservative Republicans owning up to the experience.
\
? Forty-six percent of singles say their political views have not changed in the last 10 years.
\
? Gays and lesbians are about equally likely as heterosexual singles to seek a partner who has a similar level of education (29 percent of heterosexuals, 23 percent of gay men, and 31 percent of lesbians); has a successful career (33 percent of heterosexuals, 30 percent of gays, 28 percent of lesbians); is physically attractive (73 percent of heterosexuals, 75 percent of gays, 70 percent of lesbians); has a sense of humor (83 percent of heterosexuals, 82 percent of gays, 89 percent of lesbians) and who is confident and self-assured (74 percent of heterosexuals, 73 percent of gays, and 73 percent of lesbians).
\
? Thirty-three percent of men and 43 percent of women have fallen in love with someone they didn't initially find attractive.

Iott did his duty on Food Town
\
Your Sept. 22 article ""Records check contradicts Kaptur's ad,"" delineating Rich Iott's role in the Seaway Food Town sale, accomplishes two things.
\
It accurately assesses any CEO's fiduciary duty to investors, in this case Mr. Iott's responsibilities amid market forces pressuring a low-margin grocery business with enormous and growing competition in the late 1990s. Your article assigned culpability in decision-making and outcomes. It also showed that the Kaptur campaign either is clueless about such factors and forces, or worse, is aware yet willing to mislead us.
\
Rich Iott is an honest, forthright, and thoughtful person who has always had the best interest of Toledo at heart. During this campaign, when I took issue with some of his positions on solar energy, he has reviewed my facts.
\
My fear is not only of the misleading information spewed by office-seekers. It is also of a dangerous willingness by the public to accept it. The public needs to be much more intellectually engaged before votes are cast.
\
If voters are unwilling, then maybe there is a reason Toledo is mired in competitive mediocrity.
\
Rob Robinson

Where is work Iott brought here?
\
Though I was glad to see that you fact-checked and analyzed political ads, I was dismayed that you did not have a front-page story documenting whether Rich Iott's assertion that he is a ""job creator"" is true.
\
Although you exonerated him from blame, his decision to sell Food Town to Spartan Stores ultimately cost the Toledo area about 5,000 jobs. So I expect that you will follow up with an equally detailed article documenting the 5,000 or more jobs that Mr. Iott's business acumen has created in Toledo since Food Town closed.
\
If this cannot be proved, then his assertion that he is a job creator is false and should be reported accordingly.

Kaptur fighting for political life
\
After watching the Kaptur-Iott debate, I now know that Miss Kaptur is in the fight of her political life (""Kaptur, Iott clash in heated 1st debate,"" Sept. 28).
\
I saw a long-time political hack who wants to keep her job more than she wants to help the people of the 9th District. She likes to chide Mr. Iott about his wealth, but don't forget her $174,000 annual salary or her $1 million campaign war chest.
\
The sign that she's in trouble will be that Vice President Joe Biden or President Obama visits northwest Ohio on her behalf.

Back Kaptur for 28 more years
\
I received an anti-Marcy Kaptur flyer in the mail, proclaiming she has been part of a problem for 28 years. I recall eight years of peace and prosperity while she served during the Clinton administration.
\
I lost my job during the last year of George W. Bush's administration. After two years of being without a job, I am working again, thanks to incentives put in place under the Obama Administration.
\
I'm voting for Miss Kaptur. I hope she serves another 28 years, under all Democratic presidents.
\

\
Iott wouldn't vote as Kaptur did
\
Marcy Kaptur's campaign ads are lies, misstatements of facts, and class envy.
\
Rich Iott and his family developed a successful business through hard work, long hours, and entrepreneurial skill. It employed thousands of Toledoans with well-paying jobs. They made a business decision to try to save these jobs from the competition they saw coming from larger companies. Spartan ignored sound advice from Mr. Iott, and ended up closing the stores.
\
Iott family members profited from the merger. They earned it through many years of hard work. Today, Miss Kaptur would probably want to bail out Spartan with taxpayer money. In a capitalist society, only the strong should survive.
\
Miss Kaptur is an old war horse who needs to be replaced by someone like Rich Iott, who knows how to create a business-friendly environment.
\
He would not have voted for cap and trade, which will destroy thousands of Ohio jobs, or for Obamacare, which will impose huge costs on small business, preventing them from hiring and expanding.

Why throw that away? For the community's sake, keep Marcy Kaptur in Congress.

Congressional earmarks cost the country dearly in increased and unnecessary spending. I am not so sure that many of Rep. Marcy Kaptur's projects have brought long-term benefit to northwest Ohio.
\
A case in point is the University of Toledo's Nitschke Technology Commercialization Complex, which was dedicated in April. It was completed with the help of a $2 million federal development grant and was highlighted as another of Miss Kaptur's successes.
\
But the complex sits nearly empty, as a testimony to the wastefulness of pork-barrel politics.

"
95,"The Coachella Valley is getting five hydrogen-powered buses to serve low-income communities -- and the largest hydrogen fueling station of its kind in the country.\SunLine Transit Agency's new zero-emission buses will run from Indio to Mecca and Oasis, passing through parts of the eastern Coachella Valley where childhood asthma is unusually common and ozone pollution from cars, trucks and industry far exceeds state averages. The hydrogen that fuels those buses with be generated by a process that uses electricity, some of which will come from solar panels, to split water molecules.\The upgrades are being funded by $12.5 million from California's cap-and-trade program, which requires oil refiners, power plants and other climate polluters to pay a fee for the greenhouse gases they emit. The Federal Transit Administration is pitching in with $2.75 million, and SunLine will chip in $5.2 million of its own.\SunLine is already a leader in hydrogen fuel cell technology -- the Coachella Valley transit authority started using hydrogen a decade ago, and currently runs five hydrogen-powered buses out of just 21 in the state. Fuel cell cars use oxygen to strip hydrogen atoms of their electrons, generating electricity and creating only water as a byproduct.\""A hydrogen bus is just an electric bus, it just doesn't have to be plugged in,"" Lauren Skiver, SunLine's chief executive, said in an interview. ""It's kind of like a hybrid car, but you're using an even cleaner fuel than gasoline to generate the electricity.""\Hydrogen cars, trucks and buses have been slow to take off, at least compared to plug-in vehicles. As of October, there were just 925 fuel cell vehicles registered in California, according to the state's Air Resources Board. By comparison, more than 250,000 plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles had been sold in California by November, according to the Plug-In Electric Vehicle Collaborative, a public-private partnership.\High costs are one of the reasons fuel cell cars aren't more popular. The Toyota Mirai, for instance, leases for $349 per month, with the Honda Clarity going for $369. But the lack of charging infrastructure is a bigger hurdle. According to the California Fuel Cell Partnership, which is funded by government agencies and car companies, there are just 27 retail fueling stations for passenger vehicles, mostly clustered in the Los Angeles Basin and the Bay Area. None of the hydrogen stations are in the Coachella Valley.\""You need stations to sell vehicles,"" said Nico Bouwkamp, technical program manager at the California Fuel Cell Partnership.\Another two dozen stations are funded and under development, according to a January report from the Air Resources Board and the California Energy Commission. In 2013, state legislators passed a law calling for the development of 100 publicly accessible fueling stations, and directing the energy commission to spend up to $20 million annually to fund their construction. The report projects that goal will be met in 2024.\It costs between $2.4 and $2.8 million to build the average fueling station, the report estimates. Fuel cell advocates are hopeful that once 100 facilities are operational, private investors will be more willing to fund additional infrastructure, Bouwkamp said.\Gov. Jerry Brown has set a goal of putting 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles on California's roads by 2025 in an effort to limit the greenhouse gas emissions that are primarily responsible for climate change. While hydrogen cars face obstacles, they also have some advantages over plug-in electric vehicles. For instance, they currently have longer ranges: Toyota's Mirai can run 312 miles on a full tank, compared to 238 miles on a full change for the plug-in electric Chevrolet Bolt. Hydrogen vehicle drivers can also fill their tanks at traditional fueling stations, just like they're accustomed to doing with gasoline-powered cars -- and they don't have to wait hours for the vehicles to charge.\Still, the technology has its critics -- including Elon Musk, chief executive of the electric automaker Tesla Motors. At a conference in 2015, Musk called hydrogen fuel cells ""extremely silly,"" since they use energy far less efficiently than traditional electric cars.\""If you're going to pick an energy storage mechanism, hydrogen is an incredibly dumb one to pick,"" Musk said at the time.\State officials say the $12.5 million grant to SunLine should help bring down the costs of fuel cell buses.\""The first generation of these buses were very expensive. Now they're less expensive, but they're still on the more expensive side if you compare them to a diesel or natural gas bus,"" said Peter Christensen, an official at the California Air Resources Board, which awarded the grant to SunLine after a competitive solicitation process.\Bouwkamp said it's important that Sunline's five new hydrogen-powered buses will be supplied by New Flyer, the largest manufacturer of transit buses in North America.\""They've never taken the lead on building those. Now they have a group internally working on fuel cell buses,"" Bouwkamp said. ""Now everyone can start working on cost reduction in a significant way.""\Another company, Hydrogenics, will build SunLine an ""electrolyzer,"" which produces hydrogen by using electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms. State officials say it will be the country's largest electrolyzer.\That device will replace the ""steam reformer"" SunLine uses to produce hydrogen, which strips hydrogen molecules from natural gas.\Right now, 95 percent of the hydrogen produced in the United States comes from steam reformation, according to the federal Department of Energy -- and from a climate standpoint, that's a problem. While fuel cell cars produce no tailpipe emissions regardless of where their hydrogen comes from, steam reformation produces planet-warming carbon dioxide as a byproduct. When those emissions are taken into account, hydrogen-powered cars still pollute the climate, although less than traditional cars do.\Producing hydrogen via electrolysis, if widely adopted, would help solve that problem. Cost is the main obstacle: Electrolysis is more expensive than steam reformation.\And electrolysis isn't a perfect solution. Most electricity is still generated by burning fossil fuels, which spew greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. But that problem is easier to solve. California already gets more than a quarter of its electricity from climate-friendly sources like solar and wind, and state law calls for 50 percent clean energy by 2030. Lawmakers are considering a bill that would raise the mandate to 100 percent by 2050.\Sammy Roth writes about energy and the environment for The Desert Sun.

2 bills aim to stop Web bullies
\
A recent letter to the editor (""Work to end cyberbullying,"" Readers' Forum, Oct. 7) draws attention to the growing problem of cyberbullying.
\
Bullying can have devastating effects on a child's development and academic performance. These consequences are amplified by the addition of cyberbullying.
\
Students now can bully their classmates from anywhere, using their computers and cell phones. But the most harmful effects still occur at school, where cruel taunts on social networks or in text messages are read and spread around.
\
The Cyberbullying Research Center recently surveyed 4,000 students and found 20 percent had experienced cyberbullying. The National Association of School Psychologists reports that victims of cyberbullying have increased rates of depression, suicidal thoughts, and poor academic achievement. They are eight times more likely to bring a gun to school.
\
Bills before the General Assembly outline a more comprehensive definition of bullying, require schools to provide anti-cyberbullying training, and allow schools to discipline kids who engage in cyberbullying that causes serious problems at school. The bills would enable schools to investigate cyberbullying claims made by victims, witnesses, or parents.
\
We must protect our students from the devastating effects of cyberbullying to foster a safe and secure learning environment.

Blade will have role in TPS tax
\
The Blade asked this community to vote for Toledo Public Schools' continuing - as in forever - property tax levy (""Yes (gulp) on TPS tax,"" Oct. 17). Yet your editorial spelled out more reasons to vote no than yes. Still, because of the severe short-term pain that would occur if the levy is rejected, you urged voters to support its passage.
\
You also asked voters to set conditions and hold TPS accountable. But in this bet, voters are either all in or all out. Conditions can't be imposed. TPS can't be held accountable, except for some unspecified future levy when we will be told once again there is no other choice to avoid the pain.
\
Holding TPS accountable is impossible without current and accurate information disseminated to our community and accurately reported and scrutinized. The Blade should demand TPS transparency and report in a manner that assures balance and promotes discussion about TPS operations. Investigative reporting on crucial issues should include dissenting points of view. Reporting and editorials must examine important decisions.
\
In asking that we vote for a levy at one of the worst economic times, and that we hold TPS accountable, The Blade has assumed a responsibility that it dare not shrug off, lest it become part of the problem. You have set a high standard that you now will be judged against.
\
We can only hope that you hold up your end of the bet you are asking us to make with our money.

In the TBA's recent judicial election poll, 275 local attorneys rated Judge Stephen Yarbourgh ""highly recommended."" Forty-nine gave Judge Cosme the same rating, while 254 said she was ""not recommended,"" the lowest classification.

Why did Kaptur say no to WSPD?
\
I commend The Blade for exposing the lies in Rep. Marcy Kaptur's campaign ad about Rich Iott. Miss Kaptur said she supports these lies, which says a lot about her character.
\
It makes sense to have WSPD-AM, 1370, sponsor an Iott/Kaptur debate before the Nov. 2 election. But I was told by Brian Wilson, a host on WSPD, that Miss Kaptur refused. If Mr. Iott has no problem participating in debates sponsored by The Blade and the Toledo Free Press, why did she refuse a WSPD-sponsored debate?
\
If Miss Kaptur can't stand the heat, she had better get out of the kitchen.

Kaptur displays devotion to area
\
I won a contest a few years ago in which the prize was lunch with Rep. Marcy Kaptur. No media, just two women sharing stories. Within minutes, I felt as if this was the kind of person I would want as a member of my family.
\
Miss Kaptur has given her life to Ohio. She lives in a small, unpretentious home. She gave her pay raise to charity. She works night and day for the good of the state.
\
She may have voted for things we don't all agree with, but what politician hasn't? Miss Kaptur makes herself accessible and doesn't need limousines or private planes to get where she needs to go. Her record of 28 years of devotion and dedication says it all.
\
I can't vote for her because she no longer represents my district. But I wish her the best of luck in the upcoming election.

Time for Kaptur to come home

Rep. Marcy Kaptur helped get the World War II Memorial in Washington built. She also voted to cut Medicare by billions of dollars, which will hurt the senior citizens she helped to honor.
\
Seniors aren't going to get a cost-of-living raise in their Social Security benefits for the second year in a row. But Miss Kaptur got a raise, as did the other members of Congress.
\
In a TV ad, Miss Kaptur stands in front of the house she grew up in and says that's where she lives. That's where she lives when she's in Toledo. When she's in Washington, she lives in a $482,000 condo in Alexandria, Va. And she owns four other houses in Toledo.
\
Our Founding Fathers never intended Congress to become a career. After 28 years, it's time for Miss Kaptur to come home to live in the house she grew up in.

Iott's wardrobe is not important
\
Is Rich Iott's wardrobe more important than the skeletons in Rep. Marcy Kaptur's closet (""Iott accused of overplaying his military service,"" Oct. 20)?
\
Miss Kaptur championed cap-and-trade legislation, which would destroy jobs across Ohio while raising everyone's energy rates.
\
The health-care reform law will result in less choice and reduced coverage. Miss Kaptur voted for it.
\
And she voted for a trillion-dollar stimulus package that will saddle our children and grandchildren with massive debt.
\
Miss Kaptur's shortcomings never get much coverage. Investigations of her ethical conduct, companies that back her getting millions of dollars by converting to nonprofits, her failure to meet constituents in a town-hall setting, and lying about her opponent are momentarily mentioned, then swept under the rug.

Auto bailout rejection is union busting
\
The announcement that the federal government will bail out Citigroup to the tune of $20 billion is quite revealing and should get our attention as workers, as representatives of the middle class, and as Americans. This decision, presented as a ""no brainer"" to the press, illustrates the influence and power of the corporate banking elite in this country. AIG executives enjoy a $500,000 celebration (at taxpayers expense) but automotive execs are scolded like children who threw a baseball through the neighbor's window for flying in private jets to D.C.
\
Clearly, the decision not to bail out the auto industry is the newest form of union busting. Foreign companies (Mercedes, Toyota, Honda) receive governmental largesse while American companies and their retirees are left to hang. What will be the consequences if one or all of the Big Three collapse? I wonder how my father, who worked every day of his life, will respond to a lost pension?
\
How does one respond to these kinds of things? I don't care what class, political spectrum, or region you come from, the loss of any worker's pension should get your attention. Apparently, we haven't raised our voices loud enough in protest of the loss of our fellow Americans' life work. Who will clamor for you when it happens to you? At least we'll be able to borrow money from Citigroup at 25 percent interest.

Workers, retirees could fund bailout
\
If it is true that there are perhaps 3 million jobs on the line if the Big Three collapse, and perhaps another 2-3 million retirees who could lose their benefits, then I have a possible solution to the problem.
\
Create a holding company that would sell bonds for, say, $1,000. The bonds would have a 5 percent return compounded annually but not be payable for seven years, when they would be worth about $1,500.
\
The bonds would be aimed directly at the 6 million mentioned above who have an interest in seeing the automakers succeed in coming out of this situation as healthy corporations again.
\
If they could buy just five bonds each, the automakers would have more than you are asking the government for.
\
Then there are the thousands of retailers and concerned citizens that would consider it in their interest to have a viable American manufacturing base. Plus, if the turnout is good, other investors will come along for the ride.
\
If successful, the holding company could become an alternative source of credit for any manufacturer with a solid business plan. The politicians will probably do something, some time. How much and however late that may be, they will put on a grand show, with the usual disappointing results for most of us. Time is wasting away. Do it the American way; stop begging and just do it.

Democrats stick it to Ohio, Mich. workers
\
Now that the election is over, the voters and union members in Ohio and Michigan who helped put the Democratic Party in almost complete control are being thanked by those same politicians.
\
Previous politicians ""helped"" our area with more jobs by passing the North American Free Trade Agreement. Now, they have done us another ""favor"" by throwing Michigan Rep. John Dingell off his chairmanship of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. They appointed Henry Waxman, who will do everything in his power to help the area auto industry to succeed by implementing standards that will enable the auto companies to create more jobs for Ohio and Michigan.
\
Obviously, Mr. Dingell spent too many years ruining the auto industry by standing in the way of legislation designed to help the auto makers. Thanks Democrats, for helping to elect such wonderful people to help our little region of the world. I just can't wait for the changes to start coming. You ain't seen nothing yet.

Use employee assets to save automakers
\
Here's my suggestion for saving the U.S. auto industry: Have them save themselves. How? Use the assets of their employee pension/profit-sharing/401(k) plans. Change the pension laws to allow these plans to invest in a large way in their own companies. Suspend the rules on self-dealing and fiduciary obligations so that they can make these large plays.
\
Take General Motors, for example. Allow the GM plans to invest, say, $25 billion of the plan assets in newly issued GM stock and/or bonds. Just like we do not want the government to give GM a blank check, the employee plans shouldn't either. As holders of probably greater than 50 percent of the stock, they could determine what changes need to happen (e.g. board members, management changes, plant closings, model discontinuations, etc.).
\
Similarly, suspend all bonus payments and issue new stock. Cut all salaries and wages 10 percent and issue stock in their place. This solves the problem of an immediate cash need and, long term, creates a great incentive for all GM employees to save the company, their jobs, and their retirement benefits.
\
Instead of all of America taking the gamble on a bailout, those who have benefited the most from the great benefits of working for GM would take the risk. If the GM employees and retirees do not want to take on the risk, perhaps they are telling the rest of us that the company should go into bankruptcy. If they take the risk and they succeed, they should be entitled to great rewards.

Environment rivals the economic crisis
\
In a recent story, Blade staff writer Tom Henry pointed out the potential for a ""cap-and-trade"" system to curb carbon emissions and fight global warming. Kudos to Mr. Henry for his stalwart attention to environmental issues.
\
We face a crisis that rivals the current economic crisis: global warming. It threatens our livelihood and the future of humanity just as surely as the looming deficits and the credit freeze. We need leaders who see that swift action to stabilize our climate is just as important as efforts to stabilize the economy and move just as decisively to remedy it.
\
We can use American ingenuity and determination to ramp up renewable energy production to reduce our dependence on dirty fossil fuels.
\
As we move to fight global warming, we also bolster the economy by creating good-paying jobs in America and give consumers real options for saving energy and reducing our dependence on oil.
\
When Congress and the new administration return to Washington on January, I hope solving the global warming crisis will go hand in hand with efforts to restore our economy.

Target speeders, not property owners
\
I've owned the same house on North Haven Street since 1972. The street has one-side parking only so visitors park on the side of my house, which happens to open onto an unpaved street. No one in my neighborhood has ever complained about this, nor have Toledo police ever notified us that this was not allowed. Recently, however, a police officer stopped at my house when she saw my nephew's car parked beside the house and told my sister that they've been told to target vehicles in yards and pass out tickets.
\
I think tax money that pays for police protection should be used for better purposes, such as solving crimes. If Mayor Carty Finkbeiner needs more money for the city budget, he should have police target speeders or the many unsafe drivers that cause accidents every day on our city streets. He doesn't have to target property owners for parking on their own property unless there is a specific complaint from a neighbor. I really see this as unnecessary harassment.
\
There is an old saying: I wouldn't vote for him for dog catcher. For my money, I would rather vote for our dog catcher than vote for a mayor who would allow residents to be harassed by the police in this manner.

98,"
The nation's first-ever limits on carbon pollution from power plants would give coal-dependent states such as Kentucky and Indiana flexibility to continue burning the fossil fuel, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Monday.
\
But they probably won't be able to burn quite as much of it.
\
Under the EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan - designed to cut America's carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants by 30 percent in the next 16 years - coal-dependent states would need to burn the fuel more efficiently and demonstrate they are working toward reducing the heat-trapping pollution blamed for global warming.
\
States also can achieve their goals by embracing alternative energy - such as solar, wind or hydro power. They can develop better programs to help homes and businesses use electricity more efficiently; or can join regional ""cap-and-trade"" programs, in which utilities that cut pollution sell credits to those that do not.
\
""The glue that holds this plan together, and the key to making it work, is that each state's goal is tailored to its own circumstances, and states have the flexibility to reach their goal in whatever way works best for them,"" EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said. ""Each state is different, so each goal, and each path, can be different.""
\
Kentucky, for example, has one of the nation's highest rates of carbon-dioxide emissions per megawatt hour, a product of its reliance on coal-burning electrical plants, and would need to reduce its carbon-dioxide emission rate by 18 percent by 2030. Indiana would need to reduce its emission rate by 20 percent. But Arkansas is looking at a reduction of 44 percent, according to the EPA.
\
Environmental advocates praised the announcement, which marks the first time any U.S. president has sought to curb carbon-dioxide emissions from the approximately 1,000 fossil-fuel power plants that supply electricity to American homes and businesses. The EPA last year adopted carbon limits for new power plants.
\
""If we keep waiting for Kentucky politics to do the right thing, we'll fry,"" said environmental engineer Sarah Lynn Cunningham, director of the Louisville Climate Action Network. ""Finally, the feds are stepping in.""
\
But coal interests and most Kentucky politicians lambasted the EPA regulation, calling it yet another instance of President Barack Obama's attack on coal country.
\
U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader from Kentucky, again promised legislation to stop the EPA regulation.
\
""The sad truth is that the only thing America will lead in if these rules go into effect is the unilateral dismantling of our own economic supremacy and the self-imposed destruction of one of our nation's main competitive advantages in the global economy,"" he said.
\
His Democratic opponent in November's Senate race, Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, echoed McConnell's disdain, despite previously acknowledging that climate change must be addressed.
\
""President Obama's new EPA rule is more proof that Washington isn't working for Kentucky,"" she said. ""When I'm in the U.S. Senate, I will fiercely oppose the president's attack on Kentucky's coal industry, because protecting our jobs will be my No. 1 priority.""
\
Bill Bissett, executive director of the Kentucky Coal Association, said the EPA rules ""will be very bad news for states like Kentucky"" and that they would move ""our country away from its most reliable energy source.""
\
U.S. Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., accused Obama of ""putting our economic well-being, grid reliability and American jobs at risk.""
\
Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear said he appreciated the EPA's attempt at flexibility but said it doesn't go far enough.
\
""The president's desire to protect our climate is one that I share, but that desire must be attained while also providing economic security to our families and businesses,"" Beshear said.
\
McCarthy pushed back at the critics, as did U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, a 3rd District Democrat who called predictions of job losses and rate increases scare tactics. ""They don't know the plan the (state) government and the utility companies will come up with in Kentucky,"" he said in an interview.
\
Setting the baseline for reducing emissions at 2005, a time when there were higher emission levels and more coal plants than now, will help, he said.
\
""It will make it a lot easier to come up with something that ... will not adversely impact our homeowners and businesses,"" Yarmuth said.
\
McCarthy acknowledged electricity rates might increase somewhat but predicted that average electricity bills would be about 8 percent cheaper by 2030, ""if states are smart about taking advantage of efficiency opportunities, and I know they are.""
\
The overall costs of the rules would be $7.3billion to $8.8billion, but would be outweighed by public health and climate benefits worth an estimated $55billion to $93billion per year in 2030, the EPA said.
\
The proposal seeks to lower the nation's greenhouse gases from power plants by 25 percent by 2020 and 30 percent by 2030, compared with 2005.
\
McCarthy argued that EPA needs to be a world leader on the issue. She said the moves will ""sharpen America's competitive edge, spur innovation, and create jobs.""
\
Kentucky can meet the challenge ""by investing in real energy independence,"" Cunningham said.
\
""We must invest in improved efficiency, solar panels, solar hot water heaters and hydroelectric plants,"" she said.
\
Jeremy Coxon, with SunWind Power Systems in Floyds Knobs, Ind., said the proposed rules have the ability to create a more level playing field, making it easier for renewable energy to compete with coal.
\
While wind power isn't a great resource for Kentucky, ""there is huge potential just a few hours north of Louisville,"" he said. And solar power in the Louisville area is gaining traction, as the price for installing home systems has dropped about 75 percent since 2005, Coxon said.
\
Kentucky regulators and utilities on Monday said they were starting to digest the regulation, which is more than 600 pages.
\
Officials with the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet declined to comment, saying they were still reviewing the regulations.
\
LG&E and KU Energy have already taken steps to diversify its energy mix, said company spokeswoman Natasha Collins, such as the planned replacement of its Cane Run power plant with a cleaner-burning natural-gas plant and work to improve the output of its hydroelectric plant at the McAlpine Dam.
\
In 2013, LG&E and KU generated about 98 percent of its electricity from coal. By 2016, that will drop to 80 percent, she said.
\
""We have been making decisions that have headed us in the right direction,"" she said.
\
Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said city officials will work with ""our utility partners"" to understand the regulations, adding that he is confident the city will ""respond with innovations that will result in jobs, cleaner energy and cleaner air.""
\
The Berea-based Mountain Association for Community Economic Development, a nonprofit working on sustainable development in Eastern Kentucky, said the rules are necessary. But association President Justin Maxson said economically ailing coal communities in Eastern Kentucky need help as coal mining declines, a victim of cheaper natural gas.
\
""It is imperative that our leaders also advocate for maximum reinvestment back into Eastern Kentucky,"" he said. ""Such reinvestment is necessary to help the region adjust to the economic impact of decreased coal production and begin to transition its economy.""

\
The problem with the health care debate is it has nothing to do with health care. It is about money, the acquisition of power and governmental control.
\
If it were truly about health care it would address the problems. We have the best health care in the world, but the cost of that care is out of control. There is very little in the health care bill that addresses cost management.
\
Number one, initiate tort reform. That is, if a person sues another and loses the suit, then that person should be responsible for the expenses incurred by the defendant -- legal expense, time off of work, etc. Frivolous lawsuits would never see the light of day and only legitimate suits would be pursued with no cap on the award.
\
Number two, allow for unencumbered interstate competition among health insurance companies in the acquisition of customers.
\
Number three, encourage competition among health care providers in a free market environment, competing for the health care dollar. The result of competition is always a better quality service at a reduced cost.
\
Number four, encourage personal responsibility and accountability by offering tax credits or tax deductions for the purchase of preventative programs that support good health through nutriceuticals, vitamins and food supplements, health club memberships, etc..
\
Number five, dismantle the bureaucracy that exists that limits free market principles in the purchase of drugs and equipment for Medicare and Medicaid patients. One example is to allow the use of generic medications rather than the required use of brand-name products at retail cost.
\
There are many more common sense measures that would reduce the cost of care. With the savings incurred the government could afford to care for those who are truly unable to purchase health insurance through a modified welfare support program, until such time as they are able to take over the financial responsibility for their own health care.
\
Make no mistake about it, this is a major power grab by our federal government and a surrender of our personal freedoms. Those in office are ignoring the voices of dissent. The only voice they will hear is at election time. Democrat, Republican, Independent alike, if they support the punitive health care program now under consideration or cap and trade legislation, I encourage you to vote them out of office. Make your voice heard.

Issue 2 is proactive approach
\
Editor:
\
I strongly recommend a yes vote for State Issue 2, this Nov. 3. Issue 2 is the Ohio Livestock Care Initiative, which will establish a statewide board to set standards for livestock and poultry care. With this board Ohioans will be making decisions about the standards of care for Ohio livestock.
\
Ohio farmers are committed to responsible care for their animals, and a board like this should not be necessary, but unfortunately in today's society there are those who wish to control our food supply who have never raised farm animals and don't have any understanding of responsible farming practices.
\
One outside organization that is trying to control farming practices around the nation is the Humane Society of the United States. HSUS is an activist organization whose ultimate goal is to end all livestock agriculture. HSUS is not affiliated to our local humane society. Our local Wayne County Humane Society endorses a yes vote on Issue 2.
\
In California HSUS organized a ballot initiative to ban certain farming practices. They used a highly emotional campaign based on inaccurate information. Because of this win, the California Legislature is now continuing to ban other farming practices one by one.
\
HSUS is well-funded; many folks who contribute to them believe they are contributing to their local animal shelter. Ohio is their first target in the Midwest. They have threatened to do a ballot initiative here in 2010.
\
Issue II is a proactive approach put forward by Ohioans to set standards based on sound science, best farm management practices, affordability and food safety. The board will be comprised of three family farmers, two veterinarians, a representative of a local humane society, the dean of an Ohio Agricultural College, a food safety specialist and two consumers. The board will be chaired by the Director of the Ohio Department of Agriculture. This will ensure Ohioans set standards for Ohio.
\
Ohio's consumers enjoy a wide variety of food choices at very affordable prices. Issue 2 is about continuing to have safe, local, affordable food for Ohioans in the future. Outside activist interests working to ban specific farming practices one by one will devastate Ohio agriculture, Ohio's economy, and your choice at the grocery store.
\
Help Ohio be proactive. Vote yes for Issue 2 on Nov. 3.

Stabs at governor unfounded
\
Editor:
\
I recently saw the baseless criticisms made by state Rep. Ron Amstutz toward Gov. Ted Strickland, and I am deeply disappointed in my state representative.
\
State Rep. Amstutz has disgraced Wayne County with these irresponsible, hyper-partisan stabs at our Ohio governor. What's more, he admitted he had no proof to back up his comments. They were simply an attempt to criticize a governor who is trying to lead Ohio in a time of great difficulty.
\
Instead of hurling false accusations at our governor, Rep. Amstutz should direct his efforts toward solving the fiscal and economic troubles our state is facing. Residents of Wayne County deserve a leader who can put forth solutions, and Rep. Amstutz is not living up to the task.
\
Does he have anything more to say beyond disapproval and disagreement with the solutions Gov. Strickland and others have put forth? If so, as his constituent, I urge him to share those alternatives rather than engage in ""name-calling.""
\
By presenting alternatives or solutions he would be doing what he was elected to do: Represent the people of Wayne County. Based on Rep. Amstutz' recent actions, he has clearly forgotten his elected duty. Unsubstantiated accusations have no business in civilized governing.

Emulating France would be costly
\
Editor:
\
Mr. Reidner's utopia view of France's health care system, as usual for a liberal, only tells half the story. To begin with, to pay for this ""wonderful"" system, he should have mentioned (like the evil Republicans do) the cost of paying for all this.
\
To emulate their system, we would need to increase our taxes by an additional 24 percent. Their overall tax rate (per Wikipedia Oct. 10, 2009) is 52 percent, whereas the USA is 28 percent, and the mean ol' U.S. companies pay more in corporate taxes -- 38 percent -- than the enlightened French at 34 percent.
\
Talk about ignorance, American companies don't thrive off of sick and unfortunate, they aren't the ones who pay. What is needed is an overhaul where insurance companies can sell across state lines and pool the sick, where each company takes a few. In the history of the U.S., when has the U.S. taken over an industry and excelled at it better than the free market.
\
President Obama actually made the point when he remarked that the post office was having difficulty competing with Fed Ex and UPS. That's the point exactly -- the U.S. isn't good at competing, and competing in the health insurance industry would only be an expensive lesson.
\
What is often given, is soon expected, and another government handout is not what is needed. Companies in the USA are suppose to make a profit, that's how business works, people get hired and things get done. In France, it is nearly impossible to fire someone, no matter how poorly their performance is. This reflects poorly on the company, and another reason the French aren't thought highly of as leaders of industry.
\
France is a great place to visit, but not a place where hard work and dedication is valued, only a place where they do ask ""what can my country do for me?""

Levy support is economic support, too
\
Editor:
\
Most people who know me would be shocked to hear that a tightwad like myself is supporting the Wooster Schools levy.
\
I am not a big business hotshot, but I have had the pleasure of working for a number of big business hotshots. In my dealings with these big business people, I have found they all have one thing in common. They all love their kids and want their kids to get a great education.
\
The hotshots I have dealt with who moved businesses to Wooster/Wayne County all spent a great deal of time researching the community. Part of this research included finding out about the schools. They wanted to know that their kids were not just going to get an education, but that their kids were going to get a great education.
\
Without the continued support of the community, the district will not be able to continue to have award winning performances and award winning teachers. It is important for us as a community to support the schools not only for the sake of our children's education, but also for our economic future as a community.

Health care reform is a guise
\
Editor:
\
I am definitely in favor of health care reform. However, for at least 20 years of the ongoing debate, I've heard nothing about health care reform, or access to affordable health care for everyone. Instead, we are being slyly handed forced ""health"" insurance under the guise of health care reform.
\
The majority of us without such insurance simply cannot afford it, or we would have it. Forcing those of us living below the poverty level to choose between buying insurance or healthy food has nothing to do with adequate, affordable health care. Nor does it have anything to do with healthy living.
\
The bill recently passed by the D.C. elite has nothing to do with providing adequate affordable health care to the citizens, nor helping them live healthier lives, and everything to do with ensuring that the insurance industry remains healthy by forcing us all to give them our money, whether we have any or not.

Terrorist trials wrong way to go
\
Editor:
\
Of all the insane things Obama has done since taking office, wanting to try the Sept. 11 terrorists in a civil court in the United States has got to take the cake. He and that idiot Eric Holder are thumbing their noses at the families of the more than 3,000 innocent victims by making them relive that terrible day.
\
These jihadists should not be given the same rights as American citizens and should be tried by a military tribunal at Gitmo. Our tax dollars should not be spent on defense attorneys for these murderers, especially since they've already confessed to these crimes.
\
Trying them in a civil court in the U.S. is unconscionable and would cost billions of dollars. Try them at Gitmo and keep them there. This is a good place for terrorists so they cannot carry out their murderous jihad against U.S. citizens.
\
I'll betcha when Islamic terrorists capture our soldiers they don't read them their Miranda rights or provide them with attorneys. These are the same people who think nothing of cutting off heads of Americans and showing it on TV.
\
A few days before Obama-care was passed, Princess Pelosi said we have to pass this bill so we can find out what's in it. That's the most asinine thing I've ever heard. One would hope she already knew what was in it.
\
She, Obama and Dirty Harry Reid shoved this bill down the throats of the American people even though more than 65 percent were against it. If it's so wonderful, why doesn't it kick in right away instead of four years from now? If it's so wonderful, why are Obama, Pelosi, Reid and all members of Congress exempt from it?
\
No one has explained that. Medicare, Social Security and the U.S. Postal Service are all going broke, so why should we believe the government can run an efficient health care program? No one has explained that either.
\
If it's so wonderful, why all the backroom deals like the Louisiana Purchase and the Cornhusker Kickback to buy votes? Again, no explanation from the Democrats.
\
Now that they've rammed Obamacare down our throats, next will be amnesty for 12 million illegals, Cap and Trade and other radical programs, all of which will mean higher taxes for all of us.
\
You voted Obamacare, we'll vote you out of there.

Some questions for Boccieri
\
Editor:
\
I address this to the editor, but I am really addressing U.S. Rep. John Boccieri.
\
You voted in opposition to the health care bill, but shortly before the final vote changed your position. You released public rationale for your change, but since your vote was such a crucial vote in this important decision affecting many of us, I am requesting you explain some things to your constituents.
\
1. The administration calls the bill a transition, what President Obama called a ""fundamental changing of America."" Explain philosophically what this means to you and how you want America to ""fundamentally"" change?
\
2. I assume you believe health care is a fundamental right that is owed to every American, could you explain what the basis for this fundamental right is since I do not see it in the Constitution or in Natural Law?
\
3. Socialism is defined as central government control or oversight of economics, I've read and taught such socialists as Robert Owen, Marx and Stalin and it looks like socialism to me; do you understand and accept it as socialized medicine, why or why not?
\
4. Can you explain how this Senate version of the bill is a significant improvement over the one you voted against in the House?
\
5. Since you were a former Statehouse representative, how do you expect financially strapped Ohio to pay for the loss of Medicare funding that will occur with this bill?
\
6. The Senate version supports that the government should pay for abortions, that those of us who are pro-life should subsidize abortion. Can we assume you support taxpayer-funded abortion? How do you reconcile that to your Catholic faith?
\
7. Some reports say up to 30 percent of general practice physicians may resign their practices. Can you explain how we can increase and improve medical care when there will be more patients and fewer general practice physicians?
\
8. The bill has a provision that allows the government to establish a ""ready reserve"" private army. Why is this hidden in a health care bill? As a person with a military background do you support the establishment of a new private army?
\
9. The bill has a segment removing oversight of student loans from banks into government hands. There are good reasons on both sides. Why do you support this hidden in a health care bill without permitting any transparent public debate?

Students deserve our support
\
Editor:
\
As I drive through our neighborhood in the early morning, I see small groups of children standing on the corner, backpacks in place, waiting eagerly for the school bus. Could I personally recognize by name many of these young people? No. But I know that they are Wooster kids. So, they are our kids.
\
This means to me that Al and Judy Van Wie, along with other members of this community, share in the responsibility to see that they will receive a quality education -- an education that will provide them with the skills and tools to compete in a competitive world. These young people are the future of our community.
\
Reflecting back on our four children and the importance of their Wooster education, I realize that there were people then who accepted this responsibility and in many cases sacrificed to see that my children were given the opportunity for a first rate education. Now it is our time.
\
Let me make it clear that I would not be writing this letter if I didn't have the confidence that the Wooster schools are being run in a financially responsible manner. And, that our community leadership is solidly behind the administration.
\
The bottom line: will the majority of the people in this community take their responsibility to see that our kids get a quality education? Please support the levy on May 4.

How about these ads, congressman?
\
Editor:
\
I note our congressman, John Bocceri, is already campaigning for office. An election, as I recall, doesn't happen for another eight months. He has some good ads. Let me suggest a couple more.
\
""I voted for a bill that every poll showed most people were against ... I know better than a bunch of taxpayers.""
\
How about: ""I voted for a bill that was so popular it took Christmas Eve sessions and special (behind the scenes) considerations to get the votes to pass it.""
\
Here's a great ad ... ""I voted for a bill that added a whole bunch of folks to the Medicare rolls while cutting a whole bunch of money from the budget that will pay for it. Don't worry, we'll find a way to pay for it.""
\
Another ad with potential: ""I voted for a bill that when my leader (Pelosi), was asked about its provisions replied, ""pass the bill then you will find out what is in it.""
\
This one should stir some hearts ... ""I voted for a bill that will add 1,500-plus IRS agents in order to enforce its provisions.""
\
People with a strong sense of curiosity will go for, ""I voted for a bill that will require medical records go into a database so people 'with a need to know' can check them over.""
\
The real message behind this is ""remember what I say, not what I do. I want to stay in office because I sure as heck don't want to have to live under this plan.""
\
Here's my ad -- Dear John: I'm sure you figure those astute people who run the Post Office and Medicare are also qualified to run the nation's medical program. I'm also sure you want me to trust you have read and fully understand this new law and really know what is best for the rest of us. The last time I believed that argument, I bought a rusty 41 Chevy. Regretfully, for you, I'm smart enough to remember your vote and to cast my ballot accordingly.""
\
A recent letter made the suggestion we need to hold off on judging the bill until we see it in action. There are two problems with this. First, once it is passed it's law and there's not much you can do about it. Second, and most importantly, that just ""ain't"" the way you do it in this country.

Strong school system a booster for economy
\
Editor:
\
As we reflect on our past successes, and look to the future of Orrville, the Orrville City Schools are key components in maintaining our positive momentum.
\
Our community is being asked to support an operating levy for the Orrville School District.
\
Another increasing cost? Education is not a cost. It is, without parallel, an investment. Over the past several years we have seen industries like the J. M. Smucker Co., Smith Dairy, Scotts, Orrvilon/Holtec, JLG, Quality Castings, and many others invest more than $100 million in our community.
\
They invest in property and infuse resources based on the reputation of our high educational standards. As a community, our investment in education is evaluated by those who consider Orrville for their businesses.
\
Education is a wise investment with huge returns for our children, our community, our economy and our future. We must invest in and nurture the leaders of tomorrow, today. They need our support -- now more than ever.

Extraordinary teachers in Wooster
\
Editor:
\
Many resources must come together to establish environments where children and youth can become lifelong learners, creative thinkers, effective problem solvers and engaged citizens. The most important resource is the teachers, coaches and staff, who affect children's lives on a daily basis.
\
We are fortunate to live in a community with many extraordinary teachers throughout Wooster City schools. I would like to highlight some of the outstanding teachers my children have had at Cornerstone Elementary School:
\
Joslyn Chenevey, a first-grade teacher at Cornerstone, is a rare and gifted young teacher with the wisdom of teachers with many more years of experience and a passion and dedication to teaching and learning that exudes everything she does. Her teaching colleagues inside and outside of Cornerstone have commented that all student teachers would benefit from observing her class.
\
Jamie Long, a second-grade teacher at Cornerstone, approaches education by customizing teaching based on the needs of each student so all students can achieve.
\
Jenny Gaut, a third-grade teacher at Cornerstone, nurtures her students to become part of a classroom family and inspires them to be the best that they can be. Last year, her classroom family could be seen engaging and educating hundreds of passersby at the Vietnam booth at Wooster's Ethnic Fair, and this year, at the Wales booth.
\
Amy Hall and Holly Chelf, fourth-grade teachers at Cornerstone, collaborate to team-teach their students. Not only did their fourth-graders pass all of the state's proficiency tests (reading, mathematics, and writing), but Cornerstone fourth-graders scored 10 points higher than the state requirement and above the state average in reading.
\
Connie Massaro, a Cornerstone and Wayne teacher, creatively challenges students in all grades in math and language arts in ways that make them eager to be further challenged academically.
\
Sharon Ferguson, principal and former teacher at Cornerstone, creates a school environment that encourages teachers and staff to be exceptional in and out of the classroom and to be flexible in working with the diverse needs of children and families from a variety of backgrounds.
\
There are many other extraordinary educators at Cornerstone, such as the teachers in the reading program and in music and art, and others, and at other Wooster City schools. I thank these teachers, and will support the levy in May so that they can continue to inspire and educate Wooster's children.

Chamber endorses Wooster levy
\
Editor:
\
Quality schools attract and retain quality employers and families. Wooster has great schools. Wooster's administration has cut $6 million since 2000 and we cannot afford not to invest in our children's future.
\
Ohio's current school funding system forces school districts to the ballot routinely and this levy request will only ensure our current outstanding programs are funded.
\
The Wooster Area Chamber of Commerce has proudly endorsed the 2010 operational levy and I urge you to vote yes for the Wooster City School District.

Children are our best investment
\
Editor:
\
When we moved to Ohio about eight years ago, we had many choices of cities in which to live. Of the many areas considered, Wooster was a clear choice.
\
For us, it simply offered the very best place to raise a family, work, become a part of things and grow older. One of our main objectives was to make sure the schools were the very best. To this day, they continue to be the best. I have found the administrators and teachers in the Wooster City School District are highly effective and truly care about the kids they teach.
\
A huge thank you to all of you. When it comes time to pass our levy on May 4 I hope everyone can see how strong our community is because of Wooster's greatest asset -- our excellent schools.
\
Passing the levy will ensure the level of excellence we have come to expect will be maintained in our community, keeping it as strong as ever. Our schools are the heart of this city. I admire the Wooster City School District for creating strong people who contribute to society in such positive ways.
\
In hard economic times when every penny is accounted for, let's not take a chance of sacrificing Wooster's integrity by cutting jobs that affect our city's children. Our city will continue to grow and improve as long as our schools do.
\
Our children are the best investment, no other will bring you a greater return. Please vote yes on May 4.

Investment won't return a dime
\

\
Don't be bullied.
\
I wonder how many people in the Triway School District are living in homes as old, and even much older, than Triway High School (built in 1963) and Triway Junior High School (built in 1969), and are now being asked to tear them down and build a new building?
\
If your home is paid off and built in the 1960s, would you go into substantial debt to build a new home? Especially since this offer includes that you must surrender all of the capital investment you have made in your current home over the past 40 years. Would you do it?
\
This is the question that Triway School District voters need to ask themselves as they go to the polls on May 4. Triway is asking for a 4.5-mill levy (in increments over the first four years) in order to build a new grade six-12 school. The investment made by Triway voters over the past 40-plus years won't return one dime. The current buildings will be torn down. If you find that to be a bad financial decision in a depressed economy, then you are not alone.
\
The passage of this additional Triway levy will cost the owner of a $150,000 property $207 a year. Presently, you are paying $1,301 a year to the Triway School District for property valued at $150,000.
\
Triway acknowledges a new building may not save money, nor will it be built for an increased student population, as student populations have been declining. Instead, the building will be new and more costly, you'll pay more taxes and the educational result will be the same. A new building will not equal more intelligent kids -- pure and simple.

School issues
\
Green Local School District
\
A 4.75-mill bond request, if approved, would generate an expected $12.9 million toward construction of new school facilities and would cost the owner of a $100,000 home about $145 per year over 37 years. The local funds would be combined with an Ohio School Facilities Commission grant of $22.9 million to construct a combined K-five facility and a six-12 facility on a single campus.
\
Orrville City Schools
\
Issue 7 is a 5.4-mill levy that would generate a little over $1.1 million annually for the district and cost the owner of a $100,000 home $13.78 per month or $165.28 annually. The money will be used for general operating expenses of the district and running the schools on a day-to-day basis. School officials say levy passage is critical to ""Maintain the Momentum"" as the district reduces its number of buildings from five aged structures down to three new buildings in a centralized campus. The district has made its existing revenue stream stretch four years longer than anticipated through both a 12.5 percent reduction in staff, coupled with such groundbreaking measures as the Orrville-Rittman compact, under which the two districts save money by the sharing of top administrators.
\
Southeast Local School District
\
Residents will find a request for a 7-mill operating levy on the May 4 ballot. The levy would collect $1.8 million annually for five years.
\
Administrators have been promoting the need for the levy based on state budget cuts and cuts to the local budget that have totaled more than $3.9 million over the past seven years, largely by managing and reducing staff through attrition.
\
Voters gave a nod of approval to a renewal levy in the fall, but it has been 13 years since the district last asked for new money. The levy would cost the owner of a $100,000 property $214.38 per year.
\
Triway Local School District
\
The bond issue to raise the local share -- $18 million -- of a $31 million project in partnership with the Ohio School Facilities Commission to build a sixth- through 12th-grade consolidated junior high and high school facility is incremental.
\
Although the ballot language could not be changed, the issue has legally been altered to begin at just 1.5 mills the first year, increase to 2.5 mills the second year, 3.5 mills the third year, and the original 4.5 mills in years four through 28; at no point will it go beyond 4.5 mills. The new bond structure takes advantage of Build America Bonds stimulus funding, part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and will save the district almost $2 million over the 28-year period.
\
In the first year, the owner of a $100,000 home will pay only $3.83 a month (if over age 65, $2.83 a month). In years four through 28, the owner of a $100,000 home will pay $11.50 a month (if over 65, $8.58 a month).
\
The building is sought to update music, art and science rooms, enhance safety and security issues, and avoid costly repairs in the existing buildings.
\
Wooster City Schools
\
Wooster City Schools' 6.5-mill operating levy is being requested to maintain services.
\
It will be used for supplies and programs, updated curriculum, fuel and utilities, and wages and benefits.
\
District administrators have cited their financial stewardship in stretching the customary four-year levy cycle to six, and for making a significant belt-tightening effort. Closing Layton Elementary School, eliminating 95 district positions, reducing busing to state-mandated limits and implementing pay-to-participate for extracurricular activities totaled about $6 million in budget cuts. The number of administrative positions was reduced from 13.5 in 2004 to 8.5 in fiscal year 2011.
\
They have also pointed out the district is operating on less revenue now than it did in 2006.
\
The levy will cost the owner of a $100,000 home an additional $16.60 per month.
\
Hillsdale District
\
Hillsdale Local Schools is seeking renewal of a 7.4-mill operating levy that, collecting at 6.45 mills, raises a little less than $1 million, or 10 percent of the district's budget.
\
""I hope people don't take it lightly and just don't vote. We need everybody,"" Superintendent Joel Roscoe said. ""With all the other uncertainty, the state funding and eventual loss of federal stimulus money, we just cannot do without our local taxpayer support.""
\
Loudonville-Perrysville Exempted School District
\
The district is seeking a 8.06-mill combined additional levy/bond issue for 38 year for construction of pre-K-12 school.
\
North Central Local School District
\
The district is seeking renewal of a 2-mill, five-year permanent improvement levy.
\
Northwestern Local School District
\
The district is seeking approval of renewal of its 1 percent income tax for five years.
\
Local issues
\
Holmes County Development Disability
\
Issue 7 is a 2.5-mill five year renewal levy for the Holmes County Board of Development Disabilities and the Holmes County Training Center. The levy will cost the owner of a $100,000 home the same amount as last year, 39.66 cents a year. The levy generates $1.3 million annually and the funding will be used to support the center's school program and services offered by the Board of DD. According to Superintendent Scott Brace, without the levy, the center will have to consider closing the school program.
\
Holmes County District Public Library
\
The Holmes County District Public Library will ask voters on May 4 to approve an 0.8-mill levy, which would collect $606,500 annually for five years and cost the owner of a $100,000 property $25.20 a year. A similar levy was voted down by voters 39.5 percent-60.5 percent in November.
\
The library receives no local funding for operations, but trustees were forced to consider a new revenue stream following state budget cuts that over two years total $353,000 and forced a reduction in services, hours and staffing at the main library, all four branches and on the bookmobile.
\
Mental Health &
\
Recovery Board
\
The Mental Health & Recovery Board of Wayne & Holmes Counties is asking voters to support a 10-year, 1.5-mill levy on the May 4 ballot.
\
If approved, it will raise $4.2 million and cost $46 a year in property taxes for an owner-occupied home valued at $100,000. The money is to prevent further cuts to mental health and substance abuse services.
\
Due to state budget cuts over the past year-and-a-half, the local board's budget has been cut by 30 percent. The board does not provide services, but funds services and programs through partner agencies, like the Counseling Center of Wayne and Holmes Counties, Your Human Resource Center, STEPS at Liberty Center, Every Woman's House, The Village Network, Christian Children's Home of Ohio and Catholic Charities Services.

Matt Miller, a former two-term Ashland County commissioner and business administrator of the Salvation Army Ray & Joan Kroc Corps Community Center, is running a third time for the seat formerly held by Ralph Regula.
\
Miller lists as his guiding principles on how he would vote on legislation. Those principles are less government, lower taxes, personal responsibility, individual freedom, stronger families, domestic tranquility, national defense and constitutionality.
\
Miller's top issues are fiscal responsibility -- focusing on reducing government spending and the national debt, job creation, national security and restoring a culture of decency.
\
Jim Renacci, former mayor of Wadsworth and chief executive officer of LTC Management, said jobs would be his No. 1 priority if elected. He has been critical of Democrat U.S. Rep. John Boccieri's votes in favor of cap-and-trade and health-care reform legislation.
\
As mayor, Renacci helped reverse the city's multi-million-dollar deficit into a surplus and balanced its $80 million budget, according to his Web site, and he has turned failing businesses around through his financial consulting and management business. He has pledged to restore fiscal responsibility to Congress.
\
Renacci stated he has created 1,500 jobs through his companies in the nursing home industry, at his automobile and motorcycle dealerships and in other endeavors, like the Columbus Destroyers of the Arena Football League.
\
Paul Schiffer, a Canton native and radio talk show host, said after fighting for conservative causes, like the pro-life movement, for about 20 years, he got tired of talking about and lobbying for the issues. Instead, he wanted to make a real difference, which is why he decided to run for Congress.
\
Schiffer, who previously ran for the Republican nomination two years ago, said people are fed up with the change coming out of Washington, D.C., with the federal government trying to take control of everything. His motto is to ""reverse the change,"" and Schiffer said he will crusade for conservative causes and limited government if elected.
\
H. Doyle Smith, a retired accountant, has been active in politics since 1952. When party officials told him to find a candidate he could support, he could not find one and decided to run himself, saying, ""We need a representative of the district in Washington, not a representative of Washington in the district.""
\
Smith said he was motivated to run because it seemed no one was addressing the problems, like health care and the economy. Rather, they seemed to be using a lot of rhetoric and arguing about who is greater.
\
To address medical reform, Smith espouses establishing a fund to relieve the debt of medical students, eliminating the extreme risks of malpractice lawsuits physicians face when treating patients and adding the number of seats in medical schools. As for the economy, Smith would require an equivalency between taxes and tariffs for foreign and domestic production.

103,"A team of establishment Republican luminaries has proposed that the government reduce carbon emissions and hand out money to Americans. Taxing carbon dioxide may be the best way to fight climate change, but it also may impose significant costs, especially on manufacturing and coal. Congress should scrutinize the plan carefully.\The authors of the ""Carbon Dividends Plan"" include former GOP cabinet members George P. Schultz and James A. Baker, III, who both served as secretary of state and secretary of the treasury; and N. Gregory Mankiw and Martin Feldstein, who chaired the President's Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, respectively. The proposal has four key components. The first is a tax, nominally on carbon emissions, but actually implemented when fossil fuels are taken from the ground or imported. The rate might start at $40 per ton of carbon and rise from there.\The second is that the tax money would be handed out to all Americans in equal shares. For many, these ""dividends"" could outweigh the rise in prices as producers pass on the new cost.\Third, there would be tax adjustments at the border, refunding the tax when American products are exported to countries without similar programs, collecting it when products from those countries come here.\Finally, some other regulations meant to reduce emissions would be repealed, including the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan.\The luminaries say their plan would reduce emissions almost twice as much as the Obama administration's regulations, giving future Democratic presidents reason to leave it in place and not impose new rules.\Conservatives should be for conservation; Republicans are the party of President Theodore Roosevelt and should follow his tradition of protecting the environment. This plan shows one way they can be good stewards while preserving their commitment to reducing regulation. It would allow individuals and businesses to find their own ways to reduce their carbon footprints, and they would take their needs and options into account better than specific mandates or caps could.\That said, collecting the tax when fuel is harvested or imported may mean that users can't reduce their carbon payments by burning the same fuel more cleanly. And that should be an option.\The biggest questions, however, concern how the carbon tax would affect the economy. Can the border adjustments, which importers will try to avoid, really make it neutral for U.S. manufacturing? How much would avoiding emissions reduce GDP? And what would be the impact on jobs, especially those that produce and use coal, with all the carbon that emits?\These are serious questions, which Congress must investigate before deciding whether to adopt a carbon tax. But the program might protect us from both climate risks and excessive regulations. It deserves consideration.\Credit: BLADE"
104,"Bipartisan, workable climate solutions exist, and they do not include creating new carbon taxes. Free-market innovation – not government regulation or taxation – is the best way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\People are globally rejecting carbon taxes as the answer to lowering emissions. French citizens took to the streets to protest an energy tax aimed at carbon. In America, voters in Washington state voted down a ballot measure to create a tax on emissions.\The reasons for this rejection are clear. Energy providers pass the cost of taxes on to consumers in the form of spiking electric bills and fuel prices. American families will see an increase in their energy costs without a return on that investment.\Some in Washington have suggested that Americans could receive dividend checks from collected carbon taxes – an idea that's wishful thinking at best. Just as far-fetched is the idea that establishing a carbon tax would roll back regulations. Any new carbon tax would add red tape, not reduce it.\Those of us interested in real solutions are looking to free-market innovation to reduce emissions.\Clean and constant nuclear power emits zero carbon dioxide. We should expand America's nuclear energy production and continue to support innovators building advanced reactors.\Just as critical is the development of technologies to capture carbon and use it to produce commercial products such as building materials.\The private sector is already doing its part. Recently, Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos each dedicated part of their personal fortunes to research carbon-reduction technologies that can be deployed across the globe.\In 2019, America led the world in reducing energy-related carbon emissions. Promising research and a growing natural gas market will reduce emissions even further.\Punishing carbon taxes and the regulations that would accompany them are not the answer to reducing America's carbon emissions.

105,"san francisco -- On Friday, Elon Musk will complete a journey almost as improbable as his vaunted quest for Mars.\In attending President Trump's first business advisory council meeting, the South African-born, self-made billionaire who is bent on saving the world from global warming will have become a counselor to a New York real estate mogul-turned-president who is eager to bring back the age of coal.\The move has many Musk-watchers scratching their heads, given he had not supported candidate Trump.\""Elon has always been very opportunistic,"" says Ashlee Vance, whose Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future chronicles the entrepreneur's driven path from Africa to Canada to the U.S. ""But still, this is weird.""\The opportunities are many, as are the risks.\As chief executive officer of companies that compete in the heavily regulated arenas of aerospace (SpaceX), automotive (Tesla) and energy (SolarCity), Musk, 45, can try to parlay his Trump connection into smoothing regulatory bumps and accessing federal funding as he expands his ventures.\In particular, Musk would appear to be on the brink of bringing sleek electric cars to the masses with his entry-level Model 3 sedan, whose success is key to Tesla becoming profitable and justifying the steep run in its shares.\He's hoping to start an alt-energy revolution with a SolarCity acquisition that could find him peddling affordable solar panels and electricity storage devices, an ambition that would benefit from policies like a carbon tax that penalizes fossil-fuel generation.\Trump, in turn, gets to associate himself with an industry maverick -- a disruptor like the political outsider the president has styled himself -- who is opening factories and expanding U.S.-based jobs. Musk's SolarCity and Tesla efforts are slated to employ tens of thousands in factories on both coasts.\Musk may appeal to Trump's professed love of American ingenuity, but Tesla and SolarCity have an elitist sheen that could spell disaster. Trump appears to be clearing the way for less regulation in the oil and gas industries, which wouldn't be a boon to an electricity enthusiast.\What's more, if anything happened to today's federal tax incentives on electric cars, Musk could find that his wares cost $7,500 more overnight, no small matter on the $35,000 Model 3.\In a recent Twitter exchange with Gizmodo, Musk suggested that his decision to engage with the new administration was out of a belief that it would yield better results than a battle.\""The more voices of reason that the President hears, the better,"" he wrote. ""Simply attacking him will achieve nothing. Are you aware of a single case where Trump bowed to protests or media attacks? Better that there are open channels of communication."""

Achieving meaningful reductions in greenhouse gases that cause global warming could result in higher taxes and electric bills while also driving up costs for everything from food to electronics.
\
By how much?
\
That's one of the great unknowns, though many of the world's top climate scientists believe that failing to act is a foolhardy risk that could irreversibly harm the planet and cost more in the long run.
\
This year's presidential election is historic beyond Barack Obama becoming the first African-American presidential nominee for either major party and Sarah Palin becoming the first Alaskan and the first woman on the Republican ticket.
\
It is the first time both major parties are fielding a presidential candidate who vows to tighten rules on coal-fired power plants specifically to cut back on heat-trapping carbon dioxide and other emissions warming the Earth's climate.
\
John McCain co-authored such legislation with Democrat-turned-Independent U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman in 2007, though - like other proposals - it never made it out of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Mr. Obama and his former rival for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton, were among that bill's co-sponsors.
\
Coal-fired power plants are the biggest source of man-made greenhouse gases that cause global warming, responsible for almost 40 percent of the carbon dioxide that humans generate.
\
Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain both favor a cap-and-trade program over a carbon tax, the latter which is a straight tax on emissions that utilities likely would pass along to consumers.
\
The Edison Electric Institute said it cannot quantify how much a carbon tax would drive up electric bills but said the cost would be ""substantial."" Under a cap-and-trade program, the government would place a limit on emissions and force utilities to barter for credits.
\
Many utility officials prefer the cap-and-trade concept because it is a market-based approach and rewards ingenuity.
\
Utilities that operate efficiently can sell leftover credits to utilities that don't.
\
Such a program has been used nationally since 1990 to cut back on emissions of sulfur dioxide that form acid rain in the atmosphere. Acidic precipitation damages forests, lakes, and streams.
\
While both candidates still are fine-tuning their programs, Mr. Obama said he envisions one aggressive enough to curb greenhouse gases 80 percent by 2050. Mr. McCain said he is looking at one that achieves a 60 percent reduction by that same year.
\
Just last week, U.S. Reps. John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Rick Boucher (D., Va.) released a discussion draft of legislation that aims to reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2050 through a cap-and-trade program.
\
U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.), who chairs the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, called it ""a very good sign of the commitment in the House to tackle global warming legislation in the next Congress.""
\
Politics and money
\
If the science behind climate change is such a slam dunk, why aren't more people embracing it?
\
Two words: politics and money.
\
According to the Pew Research Center, only 27 percent of Republicans believe man has influenced the Earth's climate. Among Democrats, the figure is 58 percent. Independents are split 50-50.
\
""The science is bullet-proof right now. The uncertainty is in the predictions [of climate change],"" said Jason Box, of Ohio State University's Byrd Polar Research Center.
\
Global warming was the sixth biggest story of 2007, according to an Associated Press poll of U.S. editors and news directors.
\
But from conservative talk-show hosts to oil lobbyists, enough doubts have been raised about it to make people uneasy about calls for costly regulations.
\
Some compare it to the disinformation campaign that tobacco lobbyists waged on the public for years. We don't call them skeptics, because any good scientist is a skeptic. We call them 'confusionists.' They're trying to confuse the public like the tobacco lobby did,"" said Don Wuebbles, a University of Illinois atmospheric sciences professor.
\
""The science debate is over,"" he said. ""There is no debate.""
\
'Fog of doubt'
\
Don't say that to the Chicago-based Heartland Institute, publishers of the tabloid-format Environment & Climate News, which claims on its banner to be ""The Monthly Newspaper for Common Sense Environmentalists.""
\
Each issue is chock full of stories about those who debunk climate change as a myth, as well as those who challenge the wisdom of wind, solar, and other forms of renewable energy.
\
The lead story in its December issue last year was one about the controversy over whether former Vice President Al Gore's movie, An Inconvenient Truth, was too partisan to be shown in England's secondary schools.
\
A British High Court ruled the film was a ""powerful, dramatically presented, and highly professionally produced film,"" yet agreed with the father of a child who had challenged that it is a ""political film."" The court allowed schools to show the movie but agreed with the parent there should at least be a disclaimer for teachers to explain it in a greater context.
\
Don't say the debate is over to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, either.
\
That institute, which calls itself a free-market think tank, is believed to be the largest of several recipients of ExxonMobil money to downplay or deny the global warming issue.
\
ExxonMobil announced in 2006 that it had stopped funding such groups, but the Washington Post reported last year that the giant oil company had funneled about $2 million over seven years to that institute alone for its campaign.
\
A cover story in Newsweek last year examined the history of global warming naysayers, claiming that one group funded by ExxonMobil had offered scientists $10,000 to write articles undercutting the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Nobel-winning report in 2007.
\
""Since the late 1980s, this well-coordinated, well-funded campaign by contrarian scientists, free-market think tanks, and industry has created a paralyzing fog of doubt around climate change,"" the article stated.
\
Opposing views
\
Is this effort a disinformation campaign or an effort to bring balance to the debate?
\
Both sides have accused each other of trying to mislead the public with half-truths, exaggerations, and outright lies.
\
Both have their rising stars.
\
This month's edition of Esquire lists Al Gore and Bjorn Lomborg as two of the 21st Century's most influential people, the latest of several such accolades the men have received from major publications.
\
Most people are aware Mr. Gore was a co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for warnings about climate change that began while he was still in Congress and culminated with his Oscar-winning documentary, An Inconvenient Truth.
\
The public at large is not as familiar with Mr. Lomborg. But the Danish political scientist and business professor has become a hero to legions of people who believe global warming has been blown out of proportion, if it exists at all.
\
He has been wildly popular among naysayers for books such as The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World (originally published in Demark in 1998 and translated into English in 2001) and last year's Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Climate Change.
\
His first book, though - the one that brought him celebrity - was lambasted first in the scientific journal, Nature, and then in a 2002 Scientific American article by four experts who claimed it was fraught with errors, intentional oversights, and misleading statements. The controversy didn't stop there: The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty condemned the book in January, 2003. The committees' 27 allegations were dismissed by the Danish government that December.
\
Mr. Lomborg acknowledges that climate change exists but questions the causes of it. He suggests people take a more pragmatic view of what's happening to the Earth, rather than spending billions of dollars searching for a fix that might only have a marginal effect, at best.
\
His biggest fans include bestselling American fiction writer Michael Crichton, who described Mr. Lomborg on amazon.com as ""the best-informed and most humane advocate for environmental change in the world today.""
\
""In contrast to other figures that promote a single issue while ignoring others, Lomborg views the globe as a whole, studies all the problems we face, ranks them, and determines how best, and in what order, we should address them,"" wrote Mr. Crichton, who created a buzz himself with his 2004 thriller, State of Fear, a novel that plays off the global warming debate.
\
Although the book is fiction, many people have cited footnotes in it as proof that global warming is a hoax.
\
Among them is University of Michigan football play-by-play announcer Frank Beckmann, who hosts a conservative talk show on WJR-AM (760) in Detroit and writes a political column for the Detroit News.
\
WJR is an 86-year-old AM radio station with a signal strong enough to be heard throughout much of the Great Lakes region and parts of Canada.
\
Mr. Beckmann has a page on WJR's Web site dedicated to his views about climate change.
\
""I always direct newcomers in the global warming arena to begin by reading Michael Crichton's book, State of Fear, not so much for the story but for all the research included in its pages,"" Mr. Beckmann said in the opening line of that Web page.
\
Mr. Beckmann, a conservative, includes a 1948 quote in which Norman Thomas, a six-time Socialist Party of America candidate, claimed Americans will never knowingly adopt socialism but will inadvertently become a socialist nation under the guise of liberal programs.
\
Acknowledging the issue
\
Though many people continue to question how much human activity is affecting the climate or whether global warming exists at all, a number of public officials beyond Mr. Gore have recognized it as a legitimate issue.
\
""Global climate change is the most important environmental challenge facing not only our nation, but the entire world.""
\
Those were the words Mr. McCain used to begin his June 5 press release in support of the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2008, a bill that resembled legislation he had proposed with Mr. Lieberman last year. The bill made it out of committee but could not pass the full Senate this summer.
\
That same day, two retired military officers, Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan and Adm. T. Joseph Lopez, called global warming a national security threat at a press conference in support of the Lieberman-Warner bill. In addition to Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Warner, the officers were joined by Senator Boxer and Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.).
\
General Sullivan, admitting he was once a skeptic about global warming, cited reduced access to fresh water, impaired food production, land loss, and the displacement of major populations of people as the security issues magnified by climate change. He said the projected changes act ""as a threat multiplier for instability in some of the most volatile regions of the world.""
\
The military never has 100 percent certainty on a battleground - and policymakers shouldn't prolong the debate on climate change, given the risks, he said.
\
""National security involves much more than just military strength. National security is affected by political, military, cultural, and economic elements. And climate change has an impact on each of them,"" Admiral Lopez said. ""The instabilities that exist will create a fertile ground for extremism - and these instabilities are likely to be exacerbated by global climate change.""
\
Both sides of the debate differ over the Bush Administration's treatment of NASA's James Hansen, who has been pushing Congress to address climate change since the 1980s.
\
Mr. Hansen, head of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York and an adjunct professor of Earth and environmental sciences at Columbia University, is the subject of a book released this year, Censoring Science: Inside the Political Attack on Dr. James Hansen and the Truth of Global Warming. In it, author Mark Bowen details how The New York Times and others uncovered evidence of the administration selectively editing his work.
\
But even President Bush, scorned by environmentalists for failing to act on climate change, did something his father never did in the White House.
\
He agreed during his first year in office in 2001 that scientific evidence appeared to link man-made pollution to climate change.
\
Mr. Bush has said for the last seven years he believes governments need to take action but has said he did not want to take measures that would hurt the U.S. economy or fail to be matched by China and India. China last year surpassed the U.S. for total greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Things have come a long way since the 1992 presidential campaign, when Mr. Bush's father, George Herbert Walker Bush, mocked Al Gore on the campaign trail with these words: ""Ozone Man! Ozone! He's crazy, way out, far out, man.""
\
Even in Ohio, there has been a big change since Gov. Ted Strickland became the state's first Democratic governor in years.
\
Environmentalists accused former state Environmental Protection Agency directors Don Schregardus, Chris Jones, and Joe Koncelik of being soft on utilities. Current state EPA Director Chris Korleski said in Ottawa County last spring that uniform, federal rules need to be adopted for cracking down on greenhouse gases to address ""what is truly becoming the environmental issue of our time.""
\
High costs
\
The verdict is far from being unanimous among world leaders.
\
Vaclav Klaus, president of the Czech Republic, told the United Nations on Sept. 24, 2007, that it is premature to call climate change a crisis. He questioned if any government action to curb greenhouse gases is necessary, given the costs and the uncertainty of the payback.
\
On a DVD of his speech that has been widely circulated by the Heartland Institute, Mr. Klaus said developed countries such as the United States do not have the right to tell developing countries such as China and India they should not follow the same path toward modernization.
\
He said the consequences of acknowledging the symptoms of climate change ""as a real, big, imminent, and man-made threat would be so enormous that we are obliged to think twice before making decisions.""
\
""To prematurely declare the victory of one group over another would be a tragic mistake and I'm afraid we are making it,"" Mr. Klaus said.
\
High stakes
\
Those frustrated by the public's mule-like response to the issue include Lonnie Thompson and his wife, Ellen Mosley-Thompson, who 32 years ago co-founded the internationally famous ice core paleoclimatology unit at Ohio State University's Byrd Polar Research Center.
\
Both have traveled the world pulling ice core samples from glaciers and ice sheets in search of clues that will help advance the world's understanding of climate change.
\
Mr. Thompson, featured in Mr. Gore's book and movie, agreed with the comparisons between naysayers and tobacco lobbyists.
\
""The thing about science is it's about what is, not what we hope for,"" he said.
\
Ms. Mosley-Thompson said she is dumbfounded by what she sees as a movement to deceive the public.
\
""It's very frustrating. It's very demoralizing. It's amazing how many intelligent, very skilled people believe the rubbish, and I mean the rubbish that the Heartland Institute and Fox News puts out,"" she said.
\
The message is complicated by sound bites and short-range vision, according to Konrad ""Koni"" Steffen, a University of Colorado researcher who has been doing research in the Arctic since 1975 and has been on the Greenland ice sheet annually since 1990.
\
Earth's climate would be different in 2100, even if mankind wasn't generating so much carbon dioxide.
\
""This is the difficult part to talk about with politicians: We're in for warming no matter what we do. But life doesn't stop at 2100,"" he said.
\
Mr. Box wonders if climate change gets a cool reaction from a segment of the population because of a politically driven callousness that some people have about nature, naively and arrogantly thinking the human race is above it.
\
""There's obviously a strong political resistance to environmental destruction. I mean, it goes beyond climate warming. We're chopping down the forests, we're killing the oceans, we're killing the air. Raising the temperature of the climate is just one other way that humans are managing to destroy the environment,"" he said. ""I think [to some people] it's just another 'Save the Whales.' ""
\
Except that the stakes are global if we're wrong.
\
""Humans have really gotta get their act together if they want to take this one on,"" Mr. Box said.

THE health-care debate has been so combustible that the political fire is in danger of sucking the oxygen out of other important congressional business. That can't be allowed to occur, because the other concern about health - that of the planet - will only be hurt by delay.
\
On June 26, the House of Representatives passed, by a narrow margin of 219-212, the American Clean Energy and Security Act, HR 2454, which would wean the nation away from fossil fuels with incentives to encourage alternative energy sources such as wind and solar.
\
The payoff would come at several levels: the creation of new jobs in green industries, greater national security by lessening the nation's reliance on importing oil from dubious foreign regimes, and reduction of global warming gases. And, of course, less pollution also benefits the overall health of the American people.
\
Using a cap-and-trade system - a limit would be set on overall emissions, but companies could buy or sell credits to comply - the bill would reduce emissions in stages resulting in an 83 percent reduction over 40 years. While climate change still has its skeptics, despite the ever-growing body of evidence, even the Pentagon has become concerned about the implications of a planet convulsed by global warming-linked upheavals.
\
Before health care became demagoguery's cause du jour, the climate bill was the focus of dire predictions that are sure to be soon revived. The critics say cap-and-trade is just a tax increase on businesses. No, it is a market mechanism offered as a more palatable alternative to a direct carbon tax.
\
Critics say that it will bankrupt the country, but the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost per household by 2020 will be only $175, which is less than the likely rise in the cost of cable TV over that period.
\
They say it will kill jobs, but the potential for job growth is huge. A recent study by a project of the Pew Charitable Trusts found that green energy jobs are already exploding at a rate of 9.1 percent a year. More than 35,000 Ohioans already have clean-energy jobs.
\
It is not only environmentalists who support this bill. Groups with a personal stake in jobs and a good economy, ranging from the United Steelworkers to Alcoa, are backing the bill as a reasonable and much-needed step for the nation.
\
It is now up to the Senate. Supporters of the bill expect it to be introduced in the Committee on the Environment and Public Works shortly after the summer recess, next Tuesday or Wednesday.
\
This bill is good for the planet and for America's place in it. It cannot be allowed to die.

OTTAWA - When Canada's election campaign began a month ago, the leading issues were the environment, health care, and the quality of its leadership.
\
In the early weeks, that is what preoccupied the governing Conservatives and the four parties trying to dislodge them. When the stock market crashed, however, the tone of the race changed - and so has the prospective outcome.
\
As the credit crisis has reshaped the presidential race in the United States, it has done much the same in Canada. While the Conservatives are still favored to win re-election tomorrow, their support has eroded and their hope of winning a majority of the 308 seats in Parliament has receded.
\
Suddenly, it is all about the economy. Driven by oil and gas, coal, potash, and iron ore and other natural resources, Canada has enjoyed a long season of prosperity. It has had years of growth (2.7 percent in 2007), relatively low unemployment, a strong dollar, swelling surpluses, and falling debt. The government boasts that Canada's economy is the strongest among the Group of Eight major industrialized democracies.
\
But the prosperity is uneven. In resource-rich Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland, the energy bonanza has brought skyrocketing house prices and a labor shortage. But in Quebec and Ontario, the country's populous industrial heartland, a high dollar and high oil prices have hurt manufacturing, especially in the automotive sector.
\
Three-quarters of the country's exports go to the United States. When it sneezes, Canada catches cold.
\
With the United States in recession, economists predict Canada will follow. They expect it to be less severe north of the border, but critics of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, himself an economist, say he has been paralyzed by the sudden reversal of fortune.
\
""Remember, Canada is not the United States,"" Mr. Harper said a week ago in a statement that evoked the Republican presidential nominee, Sen. John McCain. ""The fundamentals of the Canadian economy are sound.""
\
Since the markets began falling in Canada, the race has tightened. The Liberals, who were in a distant second place, are now within 5 percentage points. They are unlikely to win, but their resurgence could deny the Conservatives the majority government it was seeking when it called the election.
\
In the final days of the campaign, Liberal leader Stephane Dion has been attacking the Conservatives for economic mismanagement. He says Canada has the worst growth among industrialized nations and has squandered its large budgetary surplus. He reminds Canadians that when the Liberals were defeated in January, 2006, after 13 years in office, the annual surplus was $12 billion (Canadian).
\
Since then, the Conservatives have cut the national sales tax as well as income taxes, depriving Ottawa of billions of revenue. The surplus is now $2 billion (Canadian), and critics warn that Canada may run a deficit for the first time in a decade.
\
The re-emergence of the economy has been a godsend to Mr. Dion, who began the campaign talking about the environment. The Liberals propose a comprehensive platform called the ""Green Shift"" with a $15 billion (Canadian) carbon tax offset by income tax cuts. They also propose allowances for investing in green technology and grants to make homes energy-efficient.
\
But Mr. Dion, who won his party's leadership as an activist environmentalist, had trouble selling a carbon tax to skeptical Canadians. His halting English hasn't helped, and his support plunged.
\
The Conservatives have called the Green Shift ""a tax grab."" They have abandoned Canada's commitment to the Kyoto Accord, promising instead to cut Canada's greenhouse gases by 20 percent over 2006 levels by 2020. They also offer incentives to invest in renewable energy.
\
Now, though, the environment has disappeared as an issue. So have other issues, such as the perennial one of improving Canada's universal health care. Both the Liberals and the Conservatives promise incentives to train more doctors and nurses - Canada has a shortage - and to encourage them to settle in rural and northern Canada.
\
Another issue is families. The Conservatives are promising income splitting and a bigger child tax credit; the Liberals promise a $1.5 billion national child-care plan, as well as child tax credit.
\
In a political system in which the Liberals and Conservatives find success in the center, which is more liberal than the United States, their ideas are not radically different. But the New Democrats, a left-of-center party, and the Bloc Quebecois, the secessionist party running only in Quebec, are closer to European social democracy.
\
The Green Party, which never has won a seat but is arguing that it is not a one-issue party. It may be a spoiler, drawing votes from the Liberals and New Democrats.
\
Foreign policy is not an issue in the campaign, which isn't unusual.
\
What is different this time is that Canada has more than 3,000 soldiers deployed in Afghanistan, where it has lost almost 100 of them.
\
While the other three parties want to withdraw or change the mission, the Liberals and Conservatives have agreed to extend it to 2011. This means the Liberals have not been able to use the war against the Conservatives in Quebec, where the war is unpopular.
\
The immediate beneficiary seems to be the Bloc Quebecois, which has enjoyed a resurgence of popularity, denying the Conservatives the breakthrough they imagined in the province.

Dropping our guard again can't become the legacy of the 9/11 terror attacks.
\
The Transportation Security Administration's decision to let passengers carry pocketknives on flights unnecessarily rolls back protections designed to keep 9/11 from happening again.
\
Terrorists used simple box cutters to take over planes and crash them into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in 2001.
\
Now the TSA will allow smaller pocketknives -- blades less than 2.36 inches long and less than half an inch wide -- on planes.
\
Small blades can be sharpened into deadly weapons.
\
At least that was the fear when pocketknives were banned in the first place.
\
Those blades are just as deadly now as they were in 2001.
\
The TSA policy aligns the United States with international standards and allows the TSA to concentrate on more serious safety threats, the agency said.
\
The TSA may believe those knives and small bottles of shampoo or lotion are harmless. But terrorists have hidden explosives in tennis shoes.
\
Criminals and terrorists count on people letting down their guard because they don't like the inconvenience of being diligent.
\
Many of the things that are banned for carry-on are acceptable to be in luggage kept in the plane's cargo hold.
\
Anyone who is surprised by having a pocketknife seized has not been paying attention for the last 12 years.
\
You don't stop brushing your teeth because your dentist says you don't have cavities.
\
Keeping potential weapons off planes is not a violation of passengers' rights.
\
Keeping terrorists off planes is an affirmation of passengers' rights.

\
There was a sense of a Senate returning to form as Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., munched on a Kit Kat bar in the middle of his 13-hour filibuster -- a break from his reading articles about military drones. This grandstanding didn't stop the confirmation of John Brennan as CIA director, unlike the silent holds that have blocked qualified candidates from filling the holes in our judiciary.
\
Now it is time to turn that rhetorical passion into legislative action. If Paul and his acolytes are serious about restraining executive authority, then they should set their targets on the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists. Passed after the terrorist attacks on 9/11, the AUMF granted the president authority to use all necessary force against those who planned, authorized committed or aided in the 9/11 attacks or those who harbored them. Since then, it has been used to justify military force not just in Afghanistan, but Pakistan and Yemen. And against U.S. citizens. Without any explicit restrictions, folks outside the White House are left wondering whether Congress authorized the president to use military force anywhere that could possibly house al-Qaida sympathizers. Legislative history implies that Congress specifically did not include authority within our national borders, but we shouldn't have to guess at whether the president can kill citizens on domestic soil.
\
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has joined Paul in introducing a bill to prohibit drone killings of citizens on U.S. soil if they don't represent an imminent threat. But why not look at the AUMF itself? When contemplating presidential authority, we hope that Democrats always imagine a President Dick Cheney. And for Republicans, well, President Barack Obama seems to foster enough healthy skepticism. But for too long both parties have cared more about partisan politics than the ramifications of unchecked presidential power. We hope Paul's filibuster will help bring an end to that era.

\
The apprehension of a Nepalese man who tried to cross our southern border illegally last November near McAllen, Texas, makes the very unsettling point that border security could be a life and death matter for our citizens.
\
The man in question was found to be infected with a particularly deadly strain of tuberculosis known as XDR, which can be almost untreatable. ...
\
This strain had only been seen once before in this country prior to last November.
\
It is gratifying that the Nepalese man was apprehended and placed in quarantine, but the great unknown is how many more similarly infected individuals may have slipped across the border undetected.
\
Border security is certainly better now than it was a few years ago, but the real question should be is it good enough.
\
The fact our border is still more porous than it should be is certainly not lost on the likes of al-Qaida. Are terrorist sleeper cells here already that used this entry point?
\
For the health and safety of our citizens, border security must be an integral part of needed immigration reform.
\
There is another reason found in the U.S. Constitution that in our judgment has received far too little attention.
\
Article 4, section 4 states that ""The United States shall guarantee to every state in this Union a Republican Form of Government and shall protect each of them against invasion.""
\
It is not much of a stretch to suggest that when millions of illegal immigrants enter our country contrary to our laws, it rises to the level of an invasion.

Daily News, Bowling Green, Ky.
\
Some horrific events over the past few months, including the shooting of a Pakistani schoolgirl and the rape and murder of a young Indian physiotherapy student, should have been an alert for the world to unite in preventing violence against women.
\
But if a conference now under way at the United Nations is any guide, that message has not resounded with the necessary urgency. Halfway into their two-week annual meeting, delegates to the Commission on the Status of Women fear they will not be able to agree on a final communique, just like last year.
\
Who is to blame? Delegates and activists are pointing fingers at the Vatican, Iran and Russia for trying to eliminate language in a draft communique asserting that the familiar excuses -- religion, custom, tradition -- cannot be used by governments to duck their obligation to eliminate violence. The United Nations Human Rights Council endorsed similar language just six months ago.
\
Conservative hard-liners seem determined to fight it out again. They have also objected to references to abortion rights, as well as language suggesting that rape also includes forcible behavior by a woman's husband or partner. Poland, Egypt, other Muslim states and conservative American Christian groups have criticized one or more parts of the draft. The efforts by the Vatican and Iran to control women are well known. It is not clear what motivates Russia, although there is a strong antifeminist strain in President Vladimir V. Putin's government. He may also be trying to curry favor with Islamic states.
\
In any case, the suggestion that traditional values justify the violation of basic human rights is spurious. As Inga Marte Thorkildsen, Norway's gender equality minister, has noted, ""Violence against women must be seen as a human rights issue, and that has nothing to do with culture or religion.""
\
... The conference will be a failure if it cannot produce ambitious global standards that will deliver concrete results to protect women and girls.

Six years after the collapse of the housing bubble inflated by the political treachery of then-Sen. Chris Dodd and others, 27.5 percent of U.S. home mortgages still remain under water. That's almost 14 million homeowners with more mortgage debt than equity, according to the Zillow Negative Equity Report. ...
\
Where they got in trouble was believing prices would rise forever, freeing them to cash out their equity periodically to buy expensive consumer goods, pay for lavish vacations, finance grand home improvements or simply afford lifestyles their incomes couldn't support. During the housing boom, Americans cashed out more than $1 trillion in equity by refinancing or through second mortgages or lines of credit, all with variable interest rates below those of traditional fixed-rate instruments. But when the bubble burst, they were submerged by rapidly falling prices and rising interest rates. And the rest, including trillions in lost household wealth and 5 million-plus foreclosures, is Chris Dodd's legacy.
\
Did Americans learn anything about reckless borrowing? CNBC reports a $7.2 billion (19 percent) surge in new equity lines of credit in the last year. That's a far cry from the $28 billion likewise financed in 2006, and industry observers say, based on anecdotes, this new equity borrowing is funding home improvements, college tuition and other worthwhile expenses.
\
Maybe so, but that doesn't mean the new loans are risk-free to borrowers or taxpayers. It's not as if the mortgage and housing crises have passed. ...
\
Notwithstanding the copious grandstanding by politicians and government bureaucrats, nothing fundamental has changed since the bubble burst. And almost every new mortgage continues to come with the implied backing of taxpayers because the Obama administration actually has expanded the role of Fannie and Freddie in housing finance, even as they are stuck with more than $5 trillion in essentially worthless mortgage-backed securities. So almost every new dollar borrowed presents a new risk for taxpayers. ...

\
Finally, a nation that is contributing heavily to climate change is taking a major step to reduce its emissions. Unfortunately, this global leadership is not coming from the United States. It's coming from China.
\
China is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, so the news (reported by Xinhua, a state-owned media service) that it's going to introduce a carbon tax is huge. The tax is unlikely to be on the scale that experts suggest would make a serious dent in climate change: In 2010, China's ministry of finance suggested levying a carbon tax of 10 yuan ($1.60) per ton in 2012, to rise to 50 yuan ($8) per ton in 2020. Experts have suggested a tax of 500 yuan, or $80 per ton.
\
Still, even a small Chinese carbon tax would mean a dramatic step forward for the planet. And it's a lot more than anything the United States has done.
\
China's announcement also comes as a bit of a surprise. For years, China has been a strident opponent of coordinated international efforts to combat climate change -- rivaled only by the United States in this opposition.
\
Yet China has much to lose from the steady encroachment of climate change, and it's finally starting to acknowledge that fact. ...
\
... Improving the environment isn't just a matter of good policy for the Chinese government, it's a matter of political survival.
\
Even if China's plan is driven by its own internal politics, it's still a better plan than what the United States has -- which is no plan at all. ...
\
It's just one more sign that the rest of the world is moving forward on climate change, boosting their own renewable energy industries and improving the health of their populations in the process. Meanwhile, the clock is running out and the United States is still running in place.

111,"
ILULISSAT, GREENLAND - Beyond the howl of sled dogs echoing across this hilly coastal village is the thunderclap of ancient icebergs splitting apart, a deafening rumble you feel in your bones.
\
There's no mistaking its big, loud, and powerful boom, a sound that can work up to a crescendo like rolling thunder. Or be as sudden as a shotgun blast.
\
Lifelong Greenland resident Karen Jessen Tannajik said people who live in Ilulissat - an Inuit word for icebergs - notice more about what's been calved by the village's nearby Sermeq Kujalleq glacier than sights and sounds.
\
""Right now, they're coming out so quick. There are not so many big ones, but many small ones,"" she said with almost a spiritual reverence as she talked about the village's world-famous procession of icebergs.
\
""When I am tired, I can watch them and feel them and smell them,"" she said, pausing for a big breath of air to help make her point. ""It seems like we get our power from them.""
\
Sermeq Kujalleq is the largest glacier in the northern hemisphere that flows out to sea. The icebergs it calves float along a fjord that was recognized as one of the wonders of the world when it was added to the 2004 World Heritage List by the United Nations, which cited its natural history, geology, and beauty.
\
Although millions of people across the world still aren't convinced global warming exists or that it's as big a problem as scientists claim, symptoms of the planet's warming pop up everywhere in Greenland.
\
The summer fishing season is longer. Crops are being grown in areas never thought possible. Tourism is booming.
\
Interest in oil exploration and mining has hit a feverish pitch, with several ""interesting"" projects under way, including the possibility of aluminum smelters being built there to take advantage of the island's hydropower potential, according to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
\
A recent editorial in the Copenhagen Post said Greenland is ""believed to be sitting on a mind boggling 10,000 billion kroner [nearly $2 trillion] worth of offshore oil reserves.""
\
Even the island's first-ever craft brewery, Greenland Beer, is a product of global warming. The company markets the water it uses as purer than what is found in other parts of the world because it comes from melted inland ice formed thousands of years before the Industrial Revolution.
\
But Greenland's long-term problems from global warming will likely overshadow such short-term gains.
\
A lack of sea ice has made winter passage between settlements more difficult, if not impossible. That's a huge problem because there are no roads between villages. Greenland is one of the only places on Earth that relies on sled dogs as a primary mode of transportation.
\
Fishing is Greenland's No. 1 industry. Mild winters, especially in Uummannaq on Greenland's west coast, have made it treacherous for residents to fish or hunt on what little ice there's been.
\
Greenland is the world's top producer of halibut and cold-water prawns, or shrimp. Halibut in particular have become more elusive, plunging to greater depths as the ocean temperature has warmed. Other species are moving in, but those gains are offset by the movement of whales toward the coast.
\
Whales have become so common near Ilulissat that two of the village's three tour operators began offering whale-watch excursions in 2007. Fishermen fear whales will act like vacuum cleaners, sucking down fish they want to catch.
\
Two leaders of the Ilulissat fishing community, Peter Olsen and Johanne Mathaussen, said the downward movement of halibut makes those fish more difficult and costly to catch. Full-sized halibut that used to be available at depths of about 1,000 feet now swim at depths of about 2,600 feet.
\
Another commercial fisherman, Gedion Lange, said long-line fishing he does with as many as 300 hooks at a time isn't as productive as it was in the 1990s.
\
Ove Rosbach, who has fished the Arctic for decades, blamed the decline on warmer ocean currents flowing to the north. He said a similar phenomenon occurred in the 1950s.
\
Halibut returned when the ocean current cooled in the 1970s, but Mr. Rosbach said things feel different now. ""[Even] when the sun is not shining, it's still very warm,"" he said. ""The sun is warmer than normal now.""
\
Niels Kristensen, an Ilulissat municipal official, said many fishermen can no longer catch what their quota allows. ""It's much more difficult because of the climate,"" he said.
\
Warming, cooling cycles
\
Greenland and its ice sheets are immense. The island spans 1,660 miles from north to south, longer than the distance from Maine to Cuba. From west to east, Greenland is 652 miles, just shy of the distance between Chicago and New York.
\
It is a fickle place. A Danish territory of 56,000 people, it has gone through extreme warming and cooling periods before.
\
Literature produced for visitors claims various cultures of Inuits have lived on Greenland for more than 4,500 years, although it also notes extensive periods in which the island had no inhabitants - usually when climatic conditions were so extremely cold there was little, if any, wildlife to hunt.
\
Legend has it the island got its name from a murderous Viking called Erik the Red, after he was ousted from Iceland about 950 A.D.
\
He reportedly put together a group of men to sail with him, with the lure of an island of lush greenery. That was more than 1,000 years ago, during the Medieval Warming Period - a climatic era that preceded the Little Ice Age and the island's modern ice sheet.
\
That ice sheet today is a hotbed for research as scientists from across the world study how the island is melting, sometimes with lakes appearing out of nowhere and the melt water vanishing suddenly through deep crevices known as moulins.
\
Greenland may be a harbinger of things to come, although it is second to Antarctica terms of ice.
\
Seventy-seven percent of the planet's fresh water is locked up in the ice sheets that cover Greenland and Antarctica, with about 70 percent of that in Antarctica. Ninety-eight percent of Antarctica is still covered by ice compared to Greenland's 80 percent.
\
Antarctica, the coldest and windiest place on Earth, is seven times the size of Greenland. It is less prone to melt. Portions of that continent's ice sheet are actually thickening, a reminder of how much more rugged the South Pole is than the North Pole. Antarctica has 250 days a year that are 50 degrees below zero or colder.
\
Far-reaching effects
\
While politicians remain in a quandary over what to do about global warming, change is coming that will affect life everywhere from the Himalayan mountain range in Asia to the Great Lakes region of North America.
\
Peru's political instability is further threatened by changes in water flow as glaciers retreat in the central Andes mountains, resulting in less water for agriculture and hydroelectric power.
\
Southern Africa is expected to lose 30 percent of its staple food, corn, by 2030. As London-based journalist Gwynne Dyer noted in a column earlier this year: ""No part of the developing world can lose one-third of its main food crop without descending into desperate poverty and violence.""
\
And even if the most conservative estimate for sea level rise materializes - 1 meter, or about 3.3 feet of water by 2100 - low-lying regions of the South Pacific and South Asia will be flooded. The result could be a mass exodus of people from one of the poorest and most populated regions of the world.
\
America's Gulf Coast, the southern tip of Florida, and parts of the Atlantic seaboard would be submerged as well.
\
The prospect of mass flooding by the end of this century, though, has taken a back seat to more immediate changes in the Arctic Circle's northwest passage, especially with gasoline being sold in the United States between $3 and $4 a gallon.
\
Russia - second only to the Middle East in oil reserves - last year staked claim to the North Pole, where speculation about huge petroleum reserves runs rampant.
\
Once impassable to ships, the northwest passage has become a tug-of-war involving Russia, the United States, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Greenland, and Iceland.
\
""The potential is there for an outbreak of tensions we have not seen since the Cold War days,"" said Rob Huebert, associate director of the University of Calgary's Centre for Military and Strategic Studies.
\
The Arctic's warming climate has opened up the passageway to more than just oil tankers and cargo ships.
\
Oliver Pitras, 48, of Norway, said he has seen sailboat traffic on the rise. He sailed through the northwest passage in 1999 and is spending five months crossing it now at the helm of a yearlong sailing expedition he began taking around the world May 17 to raise global awareness of climate change. Details of his trip are at 69nord.com. ""We're talking about the opening of a common route,"" he said. ""But it's still a delicate situation.""
\
Last year, several congressmen were stunned to learn that summer sea ice could be gone from the Arctic by 2015 - well ahead of the earlier projection of 2050, said Daniel Schrag, director of Harvard University's Center for the Environment.
\
Human activity
\
Changes to the Earth's climate are nothing new. Scientists believe natural climate variations occur every 100,000 years based on how the planet spins, tilts, and orbits around the sun.
\
The sun itself changes. NASA believes that volcanic eruptions on Earth, coupled with natural changes to the sun, explain warming and cooling from 1000 through 1850.
\
But the space agency also believes that Earth has been on a one-way warming trend triggered by human activity since the Industrial Revolution began about 1850.
\
Heat-trapping carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas, is on a course to exceed 500 parts per million in the atmosphere later this century, something the human race has never experienced, Mr. Schrag said.
\
An abundance of greenhouse gases means higher temperatures on land and in the oceans. The gases rise in the atmosphere and trap the sun's energy, keeping heat from escaping back into space.
\
A climate variation of 3 to 5 degrees ""is a really big deal,"" considering that much of the Earth was covered in ice 18,000 years ago when the planet was only an average of 5 degrees cooler, Mr. Schrag said.
\
""We are performing an experiment at a planetary scale that hasn't been done for millions of years. No one knows exactly what will happen,"" he said.
\
'Unequivocal' warming
\
The scientific consensus about climate change is based primarily around evidence of increasing air and ocean temperatures, accelerated melting of snow and ice at the polar ice caps, and rising ocean levels.
\
Records on global surface temperatures only go back to 1850. But the world's most prestigious body of climatologists - the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - noted in its landmark 2007 series of climate reports that the Earth's average temperatures for 11 of the 12 years from 1995 to 2006 were at or near record-high levels.
\
Those reports concluded there has been ""unequivocal"" warming of the planet and claimed with a certainty of greater than 90 percent that human activity was largely responsible. The data those reports used came, in part, from satellite images showing an accelerated loss of northern polar sea ice since 1978 and a rise in average sea levels since 1961 - accelerating after 1993.
\
About 600 scientists from 40 U.N. countries and the World Meteorological Organization were involved in producing those reports. Scientists directly involved with the panel's work shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President Al Gore. Since losing the 2000 presidential race, Mr. Gore has given countless lectures across the country about global warming. He authored the book, An Inconvenient Truth, and won an Academy Award for the documentary based on it.
\
The greatest single source of human-generated carbon dioxide comes from coal-fired power plants. Other major contributors include factories and automobiles.
\
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change findings were preceded by a 2001 report by America's most prestigious group of government scientists - the National Academy of Sciences - which stated explicitly that human activity has affected the Earth's climate. Similar statements have been issued by a consortium of 13 federal agencies called the U.S. Climate Change Science Program.
\
'A shared risk'
\
Ellen Mosley-Thompson of Ohio State University's Byrd Polar Research Center said public officials and lobbyists have wasted valuable time disputing the science behind climate change.
\
She wonders how many naysayers would get into their automobiles without making some adjustments if they learned there was greater than a 90 percent chance they'd get in a wreck. ""The difference is that [climate change] is a shared risk,"" she said.
\
People identify with symbols, but are they doing so at their own peril by dismissing climate change as some distant problem that just affects polar bears? Why aren't connections being made?
\
The cost of dealing with climate change is one reason.
\
Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain agree the United States must get more aggressive about controlling carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants but aren't sure whether a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade approach is best.
\
The Edison Electric Institute said it cannot quantify how much a carbon tax would drive up electric bills but said the cost would be ""substantial."" Under a cap-and-trade program, the government would place a limit on emissions and force utilities to barter for carbon credits with other utilities.
\
A matter of degree
\
Few Toledoans probably realize they live in the 41st Parallel North, meaning they are 41 degrees above the equator, or less than halfway to the North Pole. The effects of climate change are more acute near the relatively uninhabited poles, where average temperatures are rising twice as fast as they are near the equator.
\
Most Ilulissat residents know they're in the 69th Parallel North, which is 69 degrees above the equator and nearly two-thirds of the way to the North Pole. One of Ilulissat's soccer teams is named I-69, after the village's latitude.
\
Ilulissat is Greenland's third-largest village, with 4,500 people and just as many sled dogs. Each summer, it hosts dozens of researchers and hundreds of tourists. Many of the latter see Greenland's famous Eqi glacier breaking off into seawater from the comfort of luxury cruise ships.
\
Influential U.S. lawmakers, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), have recently stayed in the village's posh Hotel Arctic, as have celebrities such as pop singer Bjork and New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman. The hotel is in the midst of doubling in size.
\
Regardless where they stay, nearly everyone who visits Ilulissat seems to have a feeling of suspended reality when they open their hotel blinds each morning.
\
Almost without fail, the icebergs they saw the night before have been replaced by new ones.
\
How can such massive hunks of ice come and go so fast? After all, they were formed from thousands of years of compressed snow. And they look harder to budge than skyscrapers.
\
But it happens. The frequency that the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier calved icebergs over the past decade rose, throwing some of the world's top Greenland experts for a loop.
\
One of them is Swiss-born Konrad ""Koni"" Steffen of the University of Colorado. He has done field work in the Arctic since 1975 and on Greenland's ice sheet at least once every year since 1990. His work is cited in major publications. He is at the table of most major climate talks.
\
Conventional wisdom during the 1970s was that Greenland's ice sheet would take thousands of years to melt.
\
""Nobody would have predicted 10 to 15 years ago that Greenland would lose ice that fast,"" Mr. Steffen said. ""That revises all of the textbooks.""
\
His take-home message: Forget the scientific modeling. Greenland is melting faster than anyone's best guess.
\
""How can you have an ice sheet so big and respond that quickly?"" he asked. ""That is still part of the mystery, to be honest.""
\
Ohio State's Jason Box is perhaps the most famous of Mr. Steffen's former students, having done research in Greenland every summer except one since 1994.
\
Mr. Box has likewise gained attention from the national media for his work. He synthesizes data he and others generate into a ""holistic"" view of Greenland's thaw, using a number of tools, including time-lapse photography.
\
A costly problem
\
Americans may fret about paying more for electricity if the next Congress enacts a carbon tax or strict regulations on utilities to combat global warming. But Mr. Box said that cost will be a fraction of what adapting to climate change will cost, especially if nothing's done to curb emissions now.
\
Billions of dollars will be needed to construct New Orleans-like levees along the nation's coastline to guard against flooding, he said.
\
""It's going to get too expensive for the U.S. to mitigate,"" Mr. Box said. ""It's going to be kind of like taking on a global war against terrorism. It's going to be too expensive. It's going to sap the U.S. economy.""
\
Sea level rise is ""going to cost people whether their properties are flooded or not,"" he said.
\
On average, Greenland's ice sheet loses 300 billion tons of ice a year. That hasn't been enough to raise global sea level a millimeter a year, though.
\
The Greenland ice sheet has been eroding almost annually for 50 years, except for a short period in the 1970s when temperatures were cool enough in summer to keep it ""in balance"" by rejuvenating itself enough in winter.
\
But the greatest ice losses on record are recent - in 2003, 2005, and 2007, Mr. Box said.
\
Losing ground
\
In Alaska, coastal villages are eroding. Long stretches of highway are impassable for months at a time because they were built on permafrost that is melting.
\
One of the most impacted villages, Newtok (population 400), was told in June that it will get $3.3 million in state aid to help relocate displaced residents to higher ground.
\
Alaska is putting aside nearly $13 million to protect six remote villages in the coming year. That could only be the beginning of a massive tab for taxpayers. According to the Government Accountability Office, erosion and flooding affect 184 of Alaska's 213 native villages to some degree.
\
In Greenland, Ilulissat's soccer field is slumping because of permafrost melt. Tourists hiking marked trails to see the village's famous glacier feel the spongy soil.
\
During the Republican National Convention, TV crews aired sound bytes from delegates who said they'll leave the Earth's climate in God's hands.
\
""It's actually not a faith issue but whether or not you believe in the science. In its purest form [climate change] is objective science,"" Mr. Box said. ""The ice in the Arctic is the canary in the coal mine. To put it bluntly, the canary is dead.""
\
Librarian's memo: See microfilm for graphics: ""MELTING ACCELERATES FASTER THAN PREDICTED, "" and ""NORTHERN POLAR SEA ICE IS IN RAPID DECLINE.""

PRESIDENT Obama's proposal to cut carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants is reasonable, flexible, and likely to improve the nation's environment and economy. But because of the none-of-the-above approach to nontraditional energy taken by Gov. John Kasich and the General Assembly, Ohio will find it especially - and needlessly - hard to comply with the plan and realize its benefits for the state and its people.
\
The proposal, outlined this week by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, aims to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. Heat-trapping carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas that contributes to human-made climate change. Power plants account for nearly 40 percent of emissions of the gas.
\
Instead of dictating how such cuts must occur, the EPA plan will set emissions targets for states and allow them to determine how to meet these goals. Ohio's task is likely to be tough because it is one of the nation's largest emitters of greenhouse gases among states. It relies on coal to generate two-thirds of its electricity, compared with about 40 percent nationwide.
\
Still, the state will have plenty of options. It can promote renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, and advanced energy, such as nuclear power, fuel cells, and clean coal. It can encourage more-efficient use of energy.
\
It can call on utilities to substitute natural gas for coal to generate electricity. And it can, by itself or with other states, work to limit carbon emissions by creating a ""cap and trade"" network of pollution credits that industries can buy and sell - finally imposing a price for spewing pollutants into the air.
\
But Ohio's government is already ruling out most of these options. Lawmakers have passed, and Governor Kasich has said he will sign, Senate Bill 310, which would make Ohio the first state to repudiate its standards for energy efficiency and alternative energy.
\
The Kasich administration has expressed its distaste for cap and trade, even though Ohio utilities favor the market mechanism. And while greater use of natural gas will provide a market for gas fracked from Ohio's shales, that is a transitional stage in ending our state's overreliance on coal, not the final outcome.
\
The usual critics, in Ohio and elsewhere, are accusing the President of waging a ""war on coal,"" and claiming that his carbon proposal will cost jobs and increase consumers' electric bills. But environmental groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council offer credible analyses that conclude just the opposite - that job losses caused if coal-fired power plants closed would be more than offset in Ohio by job gains in renewable-energy and energy-conservation industries. The NRDC study also argues sensibly that a greater emphasis on conservation will cut electric bills.
\
There will be other benefits: Cleaner air means better public health, with fewer work and school days lost to illness. Not least, the United States - now the world's second-largest emitter of carbon - will have greater credibility when it calls on nations such as China and India to reduce their emissions.
\
Mr. Obama's plan faces inevitable political obstruction by Congress, which rejected his previous sensible proposal for a carbon tax. The proposal also is sure to be subjected to legal challenges.
\
The President will be out of office by the time the carbon rule takes full effect, if it ever does. But that is no excuse for doing nothing now to work to limit the potentially catastrophic effects of global climate change.
\
More immediately, Governor Kasich still has time to veto SB 310, making clear to Ohioans whose votes he seeks in his re-election campaign this year that he places their interests ahead of those of fossil-fuel industries and change-averse utilities. If the governor has presidential aspirations in 2016, a veto also would demonstrate his capacity for national leadership. His signature on the bill will show the opposite.

Carbon emission auction a bad idea, Congress told
\
Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky customers of Duke Energy Corp. could see a more than 50 percent increase in their electric bills in five years if one provision of a federal climate change bill becomes law, the utility warned Thursday.
\
James Rogers, who became Duke's top executive with its 2006 merger with Cinergy Corp., has been one of the utility industry's most vocal advocates of national action to reduce greenhouse gases believed to be a leading source of global warming.
\
Rogers said Thursday he supports most of America's Climate Security Act of 2007, introduced last month by Sens. Joseph Lieberman, D.-Conn., and John Warner, R-Va. The legislation would reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below 1990 levels by 2020 by capping them at government set levels and allowing companies and utilities to trade pollution credits.
\
But Rogers said a provision calling for a government auction of most of the carbon emission credits would hit 25 states, including Ohio and Kentucky, that generate most of their electricity with coal disproportionately hard.
\
""Having to obtain allowances for existing coal plants through an auction is nothing more than a carbon tax,"" said Rogers. Some energy lobbyists have estimated the bill's cap-and-trade program would cost the average family more than $1,000 annually, according to Forbes.com.
\
""A carbon tax punishes states like Ohio and Kentucky for decisions made 40 years ago when carbon wasn't an issue,"" he said in an interview.
\
The auction mechanism has support from government officials who see it as a revenue source, Wall Street traders who see profit from trading the allowances and hard-core environmentalists who want to eliminate coal as an energy source, Rogers said.
\
David Celebrezze of the Ohio Environmental Council, who is following the Lieberman-Warner legislation, said he thought Rogers' concerns are overstated. ""I don't see it having an adverse effect on consumer rates,"" he said. ""If we don't have mandates, we're just spinning our wheels.""
\
Rogers said a better approach was that used in the 1990 Clean Air Act to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions.
\
Under that law tradable credits were issued to firms based on their emission levels and reduced over time. ""That system provided a transition period to protect consumers and regional economies while cleaner technologies were developed and commercialized,"" Rogers said.
\
Duke issued its analysis of the impact of the emission allowance auction Thursday as the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee held its last hearing on the bill. The legislation still has be approved by the full Senate and House, but Rogers said he wanted to raise awareness of the bill's cost before it is reported out of committee.
\
Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, testified at Thursday's hearing, urging the committee chaired by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., to do more analysis of the bill's impact.
\
""This bill contemplates a massive bureaucratic intrusion into Americans' lives that will have a profound impact on businesses, communities and families,"" Voinovich said. He cited one analysis by Charles River Associates, a consulting firm, estimating the legislation could cost as many as 3.4 million U.S. jobs.
\
Duke's analysis of the auction provisions indicates that allowance prices could be $45 a ton initially, resulting in a 53 percent increase in customer bills if the legislation took effect in 2012. Electric bills would rise further in subsequent years as allocations decreased and more had to be purchased through auction.

115,"""It's a bad idea to abandon any tools that help us combat the real effects of climate change.""\John Carney\Delaware governor\Over the past decade, Delaware's power generators shifted energy production from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas, spent millions of dollars to upgrade existing facilities and shut down the biggest polluting smoke stacks – all to meet air-quality guidelines and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\But under a new Trump administration executive order, which the president says will make the country energy independent, states that didn't push for the same upgrades may not need to work toward a similar, pollution reduction goal.\It's a battle Delaware environmental regulators have been pushing over the last year – to get neighboring states that have large, coal-fired power plants to meet the same air-quality standards that Delaware must. Much of the state's problem with ozone pollution, for instance, comes from large power plants and crowded highways beyond the state borders.\Delaware, on the losing end of the battle for years, may have lost another round.\The president on Tuesday ordered a review of the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan.\The plan, adopted in 2015, but on hold because of a court challenge by 27 states, resulted from a 2009 Environmental Protection Agency finding that greenhouse gas pollution threatens public health and leads to changes in the climate.\Delaware, the lowest-lying state in the nation, is especially vulnerable to rising sea level, which is expected to hasten as the planet warms.\""It's a bad idea to abandon any tools that help us combat the real effects of climate change,"" said Gov. John Carney, in an email Tuesday afternoon. ""Delaware is already experiencing sea level rise twice as fast as the global average. More than 17,000 homes in Delaware are at risk of permanent inundation, and many more experience costly flooding. In addition to sea level rise, increased high heat days and changing precipitation patterns threaten Delaware's essential $8 billion agricultural industry, and pose critical health threats. The safety and health of Delawareans, our economy, and our natural resources are dependent not only on our actions as a state, but on a shared, urgent commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.""\The plan required a 32-percent reduction by 2030 in carbon dioxide emissions below the levels recorded in 2005. Reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides also were required.\The president's order rescinds multiple Obama administration executive orders and related documents that focused on preparing for the impacts of climate change.\It also takes aim at several Obama administration energy policies and requires federal agencies to review actions that may burden the ""safe and efficient"" development of domestic energy. And it requires the secretary of the Interior to amend or withdraw the current moratorium on coal leases on federal lands.\The Caesar Rodney Institute, a conservative think tank in Delaware, has long argued that the Clean Power Plan was bad for Delaware.\In a policy paper last year, the institute wrote that ""residential electric bills will increase almost $270 a year, and some large industrial customers will see an increase of over $3 million a year if a proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency to limit carbon dioxide emissions is adopted. The EPA envisions a $25 per ton carbon tax will be adopted by every state. The EPA provided a preliminary analysis of the impact of its Clean Power Plan for existing power plants on Delaware power generation and carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) by 2030 compared to 2012.""\But Delaware Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons, both Democrats, said the order raised concerns.\""I am deeply concerned by this latest action by the Trump administration to reverse our efforts to protect our national security, our environment, and our economy by working to address and reverse the impacts of climate change,"" Coons said. ""The United States has long been a global leader in the effort to fight climate change, and U.S. leadership made it possible to bring 195 countries, including China, together on an international climate agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in 2015. While the White House has not signaled whether it intends for the U.S. to remain in the Paris Agreement, the Trump administration's actions today are yet another step backwards undermining our commitments to address climate change and embrace a clean energy future.""\Carper said walking away from the Clean Power Plan and other climate initiatives ""is not just irresponsible – it's irrational. Today's executive order calls into question America's credibility and our commitment to tackling the greatest environmental challenge of our lifetime. ... This order clearly proves that this administration is not serious about protecting jobs and our environment. As a West Virginia native, I understand the plight of coal miners in today's day and age. But the Clean Power Plan isn't the coal industry's problem – market forces are. Let's be perfectly clear: this executive order will not bring back the coal industry. It is an insult to the men and women who voted for him for Donald Trump to say otherwise.""\Contact Molly Murray at (302) 463-3334 or mmurray@delawareonline.com.

Limits on carbon emissions are coming either through legislation or EPA regulation no matter your beliefs on whether global warming is a serious threat, the executive overseeing Duke Energy Corp.'s programs dealing with climate change, renewable energy and environmental technology said this morning .
\
""This is a job for Congress, not bureaucrats,"" said John Stowell, Duke's vice president of environmental, health and safety policy at the opening of the City of Cincinnati's Energy-Economic-Environment Summit at the Duke Energy Center. The half-day event, part of Mayor Mark Mallory's Green Cincinnati Plan, drew about 400 local business and energy officials to discuss green and energy efficiency approaches.
\
Climate change will impose costs on businesses and consumers. For example, Duke expects to replace all of its electric generation facilities, which provides power to 4 million customers in five states, by 2050.
\
Dealing with increases in heat-trapping carbon dioxide in our atmosphere ""is one of the biggest challenges we face environmentally,"" he said. ""Our children and grandchildren may say it's the biggest challenges of all time.""
\
Duke hasn't taken a position on the climate change legislation introduced this week by U.S. Sens. Barbara Boxer and John Kerry, but Stowell said Duke believes any legislation needs certain features.
\
Among them: A cap and trade provision, ""not a carbon tax,"" he said, which caps carbon emissions and puts a market-based price on emissions to encourage innovation and greater efficiency.
\
Stowell said a similar cap and trade scheme has succeeded in reducing acid rain and smog-producing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide since the early 1990s.
\
Also, the legislation needs incentives to develop new technology and carbon offsets, and ""we need to take a look at nuclear.""
\
Duke hopes to hear this month from the federal Department of Energy about a funding request to develop a so-called ""clean energy park"" in Piketon, east of Cincinnati, which could include a new nuclear generating plant in a decade.
\
Developing so-called ""clean coal' technologies such as burying carbon emissions deep under ground also are important because coal provides up to 50 percent of the nation's electricity. A massive switch to competing fuels, mainly natural gas, would dramatically increase the cost of manufacturing on home heating, he said. ""We need to keep coal in the game.""
\
Stowell also said any climate change legislation needs to protect the U.S. manufacturing base.

WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama has ordered federal agencies to more than double their renewable energy use over the next seven years, part of his ongoing attempt to find ways to cut carbon emissions without cooperation from Congress.
\
In a presidential memorandum released Thursday, Obama challenged agencies to get 20 percent of their energy from renewable sources by fiscal year 2020. The memorandum instructed agencies to try to meet that goal by increasing the use of wind, solar, geothermal and other energy sources to the extent that is ""economically feasible and technically practicable.""
\
The new target is an incremental step toward achieving a previous green energy goal. The White House said it would help agencies achieve a 28 percent cut in greenhouse emissions by 2020, a benchmark Obama set in 2010. Agencies already have reduced their annual greenhouse gas emissions by more than 15 percent since Obama took office, the White House said. The Department of Defense, the largest single consumer of fossil fuels in the United States, already has set a 25 percent target for renewable fuels by 2025.
\
The memorandum was part of a broad climate change plan Obama released this summer. That document included several executive initiatives, including new regulations for existing power plants that the president said would significantly cut U.S. greenhouse gas output by the end of the decade.
\
But the document also reflected how limited Obama's options are for making good on his campaign promises to address climate change.
\
Many climate scientists and economists contend that Congress would need to pass a carbon tax or emissions trading law to make a real dent in the country's emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. With little appetite for such measures in the Republican-led House, Obama has had to tackle the root causes of climate change in a piecemeal fashion.
\
The most high-profile effort has been the Environment Protection Agency's rule to curtail greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants, and the agency is expected to propose a rule for existing plants in June 2014. Obama has also pledged to halt American financing of the construction of new coal-fired power plants overseas, a stance since adopted in Britain and Scandinavia.
\
The new renewables target was welcomed by environmental groups. Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund called it ""an important step toward doubling down on a clean energy industry.""

118,"CANADA \Coal for electricity phased out by 2030 \Canada announced Monday it plans phase out the use of coal-fired electricity by 2030. The move is in stark contrast to President-elect Donald Trump's vow to revive the American coal industry. Environment Minister Kathleen McKenna said the goal is to make sure 90 percent of Canada's electricity comes from sustainable sources by that time -- up from 80 percent today. The announcement is one of a series of measures Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government is rolling out as part of a broader climate change plan. Trudeau also has plans to implement a carbon tax. Trump, in contrast, has also said he would ""cancel"" the Paris Agreement. Trudeau told President Barack Obama this past weekend he would miss working with him because he shared so many values. \GERMANY \Merkel plans to seek 4th chancellor term \German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced Sunday that she would seek re-election next year, a step that could provide a powerful counterpoint to the anti-globalization, anti-immigration narrative put forth by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Merkel, facing a backlash against asylum seekers, ended months of speculation about whether she would seek a fourth term and again take up her party's standard as a populist tide rises across Europe. Polls have shown she still enjoys strong support, if less so than before Germany, a country of about 80 million people, opened its doors to nearly 1 million new arrivals last year. ""I want to serve Germany,"" Merkel, 62, told reporters in Berlin after meeting Sunday with members of her party, the Christian Democratic Union."
119,"Letter to the editor \Six months since death of only son \Heartbroken. Devastated. Confused. \These are just a few of the emotions my family and I felt after the senseless death of my only son, John Crawford lll, on Aug. 5, 2014 in the Walmart store in Beavercreek, Ohio. \John lll was an amazing father, loving son and awesome friend. He was just starting to discover who he was, what his passion was, what he wanted to pursue in life and now he's gone. It makes no sense to me how a simple trip to Walmart ended in the death of my son. I was further shocked when a grand jury refused to indict the officer responsible for my son's slaying. \But now, six months after this horrific tragedy, we want the world to know just how much we love and miss him. Not a day goes by that we aren't reminded of his beautiful smile and laid-back personality. It's incomprehensible that his two sons will grow up not knowing their father. So it's my job to make sure you, as well as my grandsons, don't forget about John lll. \How many more families have to go through this before real justice is done? John's mother, Tressa, and I have been encouraged and uplifted by all the love and support we have received since John's death. We want real change to happen in John's name -- starting with effective legislation. We support any law that forces stores to use common sense in selling toy guns, keep them locked up, require a sales person to take the gun directly to a cashier. These are steps that can help save a life and prevent another tragedy. \Nothing will bring my son back and that is a reality I have to live with every day of my life, but if we can prevent just one young man from being killed, my son's death will not be in vain. \It's hard to believe it's been six months and we ask you to keep praying for our family, keep praying for John's sons, his first born will turn two this month. We intend to keep fighting for justice and hope you will keep fighting on John's behalf as well. \God bless and thank you. \JOHN H. CRAWFORD, JR ., FATHER OF JOHN H.

These two powerful people demonstrate the kind of moral courage, vision and leadership we need from our politicians, business people and clergy. \It's been said that ""climate change is the ultimate collective-action problem"" because solutions will require local, state and national policy changes as well as international cooperation. A simple and effective collective action that could be taken immediately is to put a price on carbon in the form of a revenue neutral carbon tax. The ""Carbon Fee and Dividend"" being promoted by Citizen's Climate Lobby (www.citizensclimatel obby.org) would be a catalyst for the new economic environment needed to transition us to clean energy. \THERESA S. WILLIAMS , NEW CARLISLE"
120,"Raising the federal gas tax to help pay for highways and restrain federal deficits is a good idea whose time never seems to come. It has been a quarter-century since the last increase, during which time the per-gallon tax of 18.4 cents has lost nearly 40 percent of its value in real terms. \Meanwhile, fuel efficiency and highway usage both grew. In 2013, the average American paid 42 percent less via the gas tax than in 1993; this diminished contribution went for the upkeep and expansion of roads on which that motorist was driving 4 percentmore miles. \With President Donald Trump and Congress now possibly about to pivot to long-postponed infrastructure modernization legislation, which will have to be paid for, change might just be imaginable. Or so the U.S. Chamber of Commerce seems to believe. The Chamber, a powerful business lobby with close Republican ties, has announced a push for a 25-cents-per-gallon increase, phased in over five years and indexed to inflation. \This is not a brand-new cause for the Chamber, which has backed such proposals in the past. Yet the case the organization articulates is particularly strong; if reasoning were the only consideration, as opposed to Congress’ reflexive terror at raising taxes, the plan would be adopted by a voice vote in both the House and Senate and speedily signed by the president. \The federal trust fund that pays for highways and transit projects is funded for the next two years — on paper; Congress employed a lot of budgetary gimmicks. By 2027, however, the fund will have accumulated a $138 billion deficit, unless it slashes planned spending by that much. \The Chamber’s proposed tax would raise $394 billion over the next decade, enough to restore the trust fund to solvency — with money left over for additional projects and a smidgen of deficit reduction. \The typical driver would pay about $108 more per year, but that could be offset by the benefits of better roads, in the form of reduced traffic and less vehicle damage. It’s also a rough — too rough, admittedly — proxy for a carbon tax, which would help the environment. \Trump’s off-the-cuff remarks rarely, if ever, constitute reliable guides to his actual policy thinking, as recent events remind us. \However, in May 2017, he said he would “consider” raising the federal gas tax to pay for his promised increase in infrastructure spending. And six months later, National Economic Council DirectorGary Cohn reportedly backed that up by floating a 7-cent-per-gallon hike. \Nothing came of these comments, but they were rare flashes of fiscal responsibility from the same bunch that brought us a $1.5 trillion tax cut paid for by new projected borrowing. We are mindful of the fact that a gas-tax increase would nullify some of the small tax cut that lower- and middle-income Americans got from that bad bill. \That is an argument for trying, over time, to undo the tax cut’s most wasteful giveaways to the wealthy, not for abandoning fiscal responsibility yet again when it comes to funding infrastructure. \— Washington Post \"
121,
122,"President Trump is giving outsiders and drain-the-swampers a bad name. \A president who comes to power with little dependence on either party and wins election by running against the special interests, could, in theory, do a lot of good work. He could use his popular support to push reforms that are in the national interest but have gotten stuck in Washington. Three examples come to mind -- none of which has, at least so far, inspired the president to action. \The first, and in some ways most obvious, is a carbon tax linked to infrastructure modernization. \This would be a win-win-win for the country. The tax would encourage conservation, which would be good for the environment and for slowing climate change. Republicans would have reason to cheer a market-friendly approach, as opposed to government picking energy winners and losers. \Some of the proceeds could be used to augment the earned-income tax credit, to counter its regressive nature. That would give Democrats reason to cheer. The rest of the revenue could be distributed to states to spend on infrastructure. The federalism would make Republicans happy. Blue states could spend more on mass transit, making Democrats happy. This makes such sense that you might think it would pass even without a push from an above-the-fray president, but it won't. Republicans are too bound to their no-tax ideology. Democrats might object to the loss of federal control. Presidential leadership would be needed to keep special interests in check and the deal on track. \Then there is immigration reform. This is another case where the shape of a compromise is well-known, but where neither side can say yes without a strong push. A deal would offer undocumented immigrants a path to legalization, in theory cheering Democrats, while stepping up enforcement to block further illegal immigration, in theory cheering Republicans. Congress could then work out how many legal immigrants, and of what sort, the country should accept in the future. Easy, right? \Well, no. Most undocumented people would welcome such a deal to bring them out of the shadows, but their professional advocates, and therefore many Democrats, would object to anything short of citizenship. Republicans who clamor for strict enforcement would, in many cases, object to the most efficient method: holding employers accountable for hiring undocumented workers. \Trump would be well-positioned to push such a deal. Though he called for deporting the 11 million undocumented people in the United States, he also said that the ""good"" ones could quickly return. The makings of a deal are there -- and could include some segments of his wall. \For tax reform, too, the outlines of a deal are in theory universally admired: cap or abolish the deductions that taxpayers can claim -- the ""loopholes"" -- and then lower the rates that everyone must pay. The universal admiration quickly wanes, however, under special-interest assault. Realtors in every congressional district explain why the mortgage-interest deduction can't be disturbed. Hospitals, churches and universities remind Congress that opposing the charitable deduction is un-American. Folks from financial services recount how the elderly will go hungry without tax-advantaged 401(k) accounts. \Realistically, the best hope would be not to abolish any of these deductions but to cap how much relatively wealthy people could claim in any given year. \You may think the president is on board for this one, because he talks a fair bit about tax reform. But so far, what he seems to have in mind is only tax cuts, which might be popular in the short term but would send the already sky-high national debt into outer space. \Which is in keeping with the policy predilections Trump has shown, to the extent he has shown any so far: conventional, down-the-line Republican, from tax cuts for the rich to the far more difficult, and politically fraught, push to repeal, and possibly replace, the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile he leaves on the table the opportunities his unconventional path to the presidency had opened for him. He's missing a chance to show the good that a leader unbeholden to party orthodoxy really could do in this town.\Credit: FRED HIATT, is the editorial page editor of The Washington Post.

PHILADELPHIA - Democrats today will formally adopt a platform that attempts to bridge the camps of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders without serving as an albatross around the nominee's neck.
\
The platform, which the party describes as ""the most progressive platform in the history of party politics,"" amounts to a policy statement at the Democratic National Convention that is unenforceable on the party's nominee- except by voters.
\
""Most people are cynical and believe that what's in a platform doesn't matter,"" said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. ""That's truly wrong. The best studies of platforms over the years indicate that two-thirds or three-fourths of pledges are either adopted in whole or part, or the elected official makes serious attempts to get them adopted in whole or part.
\
""They're not meaningless words on a page,"" he said. ""They indicate where the party activists are, and that matters to presidential candidates.""
\
The recent platform committee meeting in Orlando was unusually contentious, but Mr. Sanders' influence on the final product was clear.
\
That was particularly true in its call for a minimum wage of at least $15 indexed to inflation, a path to legalization of marijuana, and further expansion of access to health insurance.
\
But Mrs. Clinton's imprint is also ever present.
\
""We are stronger together,"" the platform's preamble states, taking a page directly from her campaign.
\
The platform takes frequent aim at Republican nominee Donald Trump's policies and past business practices and flatly questions his qualifications.
\
Catherine Hernandez, a third-grade teacher at Toledo Public Schools and recording secretary for the Ohio Federation of Teachers, served as one of Ohio's three Clinton representative on the platform committee in Orlando.
\
She said she does not believe the final product would drag Mrs. Clinton too far to the left and leave her vulnerable in the general election.
\
""It really shows where the majority of youth are in the country, as well as people who know that they want to make things right,"" Ms. Hernandez said. "".. We came out [of the platform meeting] with unity between Hillary, Bernie, and the party. ... We're clearly on the same side on all the issues.""
\
The plan calls for new enforceable conditions to protect national security, workers, and the environment in future trade deals, such as the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership pact. Both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump have been highly critical of such deals and of Mrs. Clinton. The North American Free Trade Agreement, for instance, was signed by her husband, President Bill Clinton.
\
The Clinton faction fought back an attempt by the senator from Vermont to write opposition to the TPP into the platform. President Obama backs the trade deal.
\
While Mrs. Clinton has said she doesn't believe the current version of TPP meets the new standards, Mr. Trump has predicted she would sign it as president anyway.
\
There was still some question whether some Sanders delegates might try to bring TPP opposition up for a floor vote.
\
The platform, for the first time, seeks an end to capital punishment and calls for a ""multimillionaire surtax.""
\
It proposes to build on Obamacare by providing for a public insurance option in addition to expanded Medicaid and private policies available through state and federal insurance exchanges. But the platform does not embrace a Medicare single-payer system for all as Mr. Sanders had sought.
\
It calls for generating more of the nation's energy from clean sources and would set a price on carbon pollution. But it stopped short of calling for a carbon ""tax.""
\
This is a sore spot for Mrs. Clinton as she pushes for green energy while simultaneously fighting to reverse the impression she's trying to put coal miners out of work in key battleground states like Ohio and Pennsylvania.
\
The platform applauds last year's U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage while seeking further anti-discrimination protection laws. The party's last platform in 2012 was the first to endorse same-sex marriage after President Obama changed his position.
\
The Republican platform adopted last week remains opposed.
\
The final draft of the platform up for a vote specifically mentions Ohio when it comes to voting rights, citing what it calls Republican voter-suppression efforts.
\
State Rep. Alicia Reece (D., Cincinnati) served on the committee that put together the early draft sent to Orlando for debate. She defended the platform's explicit support for Ohio's effort to write a voter bill of rights into the state constitution.
\
""We fought hard for that,"" she said. ""At a time when Ohio is so critical - you can't get to the White House without coming through Ohio - it's important to have this base of folks say enough is enough. We're willing to organize, volunteer, and try to change the system.""
\
She also said that having such a left-leaning platform is a good thing.
\
""Our base is progressive and is diverse,"" she said. ""That's the reason why we have spirited debate, because we are so diverse and represent so many diverse people and interests. [The platform] says a lot about our party.""
\
The Democratic platform, in a Sanders-sought provision that passed by a single vote in the platform-writing process, calls for a ""reasoned pathway for future legalization"" of marijuana. Mrs. Clinton has voiced support only for medical marijuana.
\
When the former secretary of state, senator from New York, and first lady walks off the stage of Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center Thursday night as the first female nominee of a major party, she will launch a road trip that will bring her through Pennsylvania and ultimately Ohio this weekend - Youngstown on Saturday and Columbus on Sunday.
\
And she will attempt to follow the path the party has laid before her, Mr. Sabato said.
\
""If elected, she'll want to avoid a primary challenge in 2020, whether it's Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, or anybody else,"" he said. ""That tends to weaken an incumbent president. When that happens, it's a bad sign.""

"
125,"
GOV. John Kasich is sponsoring a conference this week on energy and economic issues in Ohio. Organizers have recruited an impressive array of industry executives, government officials, educators, and - hearteningly - environmentalists to discuss the kinds of energy policies that will help the state keep and create jobs and promote business growth.
\
The governor, who has said that ""Ohio essentially has no energy policy,"" could do two things that would set a positive tone for the meeting. He could repudiate a proposal by some Republican lawmakers that effectively would repeal the state's clean-energy standard. Such a regression would wipe out northwest Ohio's burgeoning renewable-energy industry, costing the region thousands of current and potential good-paying jobs.
\
And as Mr. Kasich rhapsodizes about the economic benefits of oil and natural gas discoveries in Ohio, he could outline effective, reasonable, detailed rules for extracting these riches while protecting the state's water, air, and land.
\
A 2008 state law, enacted with near-unanimous legislative support, requires electric utilities that do business in Ohio to meet a 2025 deadline to supply at least 12.5 percent of the power they sell from renewable energy sources: wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, hydropower. Half of that power must be generated within the state. Utilities must supply the same share of power from advanced energy sources: ""clean"" coal, nuclear power, fuel cells, solid waste, cogeneration.
\
The mandate has helped make Ohio the second-leading state for solar manufacturing, much of it in this region by companies such as First Solar and Xunlight. The solar panel maker Isofoton says the plant it plans in Napoleon will employ 330 workers by 2014. A major wind farm is under construction in Van Wert, Hardin, and Paulding counties.
\
State Sen. Kris Jordan (R., Powell), the chief sponsor of the repeal effort, says the ""onerous"" renewable standard imposes ""massive, costly mandates on Ohio's energy providers."" His bill appears designed to protect traditional energy operators, many of them big campaign donors.
\
Ohio burns coal to produce 86 percent of its electricity. Nearly two-thirds of that coal comes from out of state. Those percentages don't work in our state's favor, economically or environmentally. Mr. Kasich should seek to promote, not cripple, Ohio-based alternative-energy industries that have continued to grow and create jobs during the recession.
\
This week's conference also will examine the effect on Ohio's economy of the Marcellus and Utica shales, potentially major sources of oil and natural gas reserves. The governor has made exploration of and production from deep-shale deposits a central element of his energy policy.
\
But such extraction in other states has threatened ground and surface water supplies, as well as air quality, because of extraction techniques such as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. That process uses toxic chemicals, generates huge amounts of polluted waste water, and itself consumes a lot of energy.
\
Some environmental groups and Democratic lawmakers are calling for a moratorium on fracking in Ohio until the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issues a study of the practice next year. If the governor is not prepared to wait that long, how does he propose that the state will regulate operators and drillers to provide adequate disclosure of the chemicals they use, safeguard public health, and protect the environment?
\
Current state law is inadequate. This would be a good time for Mr. Kasich to discuss how he will strengthen it, identify watersheds where drilling would be off limits, and direct the state to regulate waste water from fracking.
\
During his first year in office, Governor Kasich has demonstrated a distressing willingness to sacrifice environmental interests to economic ones, such as his support for oil and gas drilling in state parks and on other public land.
\
But he showed with his veto of a Republican bill that would have allowed excessive withdrawals from Lake Erie and other key waterways that he is capable of striking a better balance. It's to be hoped that spirit will prevail at this week's conference, and beyond.

Text of President Barack Obama's State of the Union address, as provided by the White House:
\
???
\
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests and fellow Americans:
\
Last month, I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq. Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought? and several thousand gave their lives.
\
We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world. For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country. Most of al-Qaida's top lieutenants have been defeated. The Taliban's momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home.
\
These achievements are a testament to the courage, selflessness, and teamwork of America's armed forces. At a time when too many of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations. They're not consumed with personal ambition. They don't obsess over their differences. They focus on the mission at hand. They work together.
\
Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example. Think about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world in educating its people. An America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs. A future where we're in control of our own energy, and our security and prosperity aren't so tied to unstable parts of the world. An economy built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded.
\
We can do this. I know we can, because we've done it before. At the end of World War II, when another generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known. My grandfather, a veteran of Patton's army, got the chance to go to college on the GI Bill. My grandmother, who worked on a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth.
\
The two of them shared the optimism of a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism. They understood they were part of something larger; that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share - the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement.
\
The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. No challenge is more urgent. No debate is more important. We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by. Or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. What's at stake are not Democratic values or Republican values, but American values. We have to reclaim them.
\
Let's remember how we got here. Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores. Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete. Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren't, and personal debt that kept piling up.
\
In 2008, the house of cards collapsed. We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn't afford or understand them. Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people's money. Regulators had looked the other way, or didn't have the authority to stop the bad behavior.
\
It was wrong. It was irresponsible. And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and left innocent, hard-working Americans holding the bag. In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly four million jobs. And we lost another four million before our policies were in full effect.
\
Those are the facts. But so are these. In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. Together, we've agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion. And we've put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like that never happens again.
\
The state of our union is getting stronger. And we've come too far to turn back now. As long as I'm president, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum. But I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place.
\
No, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits. Tonight, I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy that's built to last? an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values.
\
This blueprint begins with American manufacturing.
\
On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Today, General Motors is back on top as the world's number one automaker. Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories. And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs.
\
We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And tonight, the American auto industry is back.
\
What's happening in Detroit can happen in other industries. It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh. We can't bring back every job that's left our shores. But right now, it's getting more expensive to do business in places like China. Meanwhile, America is more productive. A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home. Today, for the first time in 15 years, Master Lock's unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity.
\
So we have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturing back. But we have to seize it. Tonight, my message to business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed.
\
We should start with our tax code. Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas. Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and everyone knows it.
\
So let's change it. First, if you're a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn't get a tax deduction for doing it. That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home.
\
Second, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas. From now on, every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax. And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here.
\
Third, if you're an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut. If you're a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction you get for making products here. And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.
\
My message is simple. It's time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America. Send me these tax reforms, and I'll sign them right away.
\
We're also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world. Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years. With the bipartisan trade agreements I signed into law, we are on track to meet that goal - ahead of schedule. Soon, there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea. Soon, there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.
\
I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products. And I will not stand by when our competitors don't play by the rules. We've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration? and it's made a difference. Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires. But we need to do more. It's not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated. It's not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they're heavily subsidized.
\
Tonight, I'm announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trade practices in countries like China. There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders. And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing finance or new markets like Russia. Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you? America will always win.
\
I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States but can't find workers with the right skills. Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job. Think about that? openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work.
\
That's inexcusable. And we know how to fix it.
\
Jackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic. Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College. The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training. It paid Jackie's tuition, then hired her to help operate their plant.
\
I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did. Join me in a national commitment to train two million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job. My administration has already lined up more companies that want to help. Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte, Orlando, and Louisville are up and running. Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers? places that teach people skills that local businesses are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.
\
And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so that from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go for all the information and help they need. It's time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work.
\
These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today. But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier.
\
For less than one percent of what our nation spends on education each year, we've convinced nearly every state in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning? the first time that's happened in a generation.
\
But challenges remain. And we know how to solve them.
\
At a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced states to lay off thousands of teachers. We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over $250,000. A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance. Every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives. Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies? just to make a difference.
\
Teachers matter. So instead of bashing them, or defending the status quo, let's offer schools a deal. Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job, and reward the best ones. In return, grant schools flexibility: To teach with creativity and passion; to stop teaching to the test; and to replace teachers who just aren't helping kids learn.
\
We also know that when students aren't allowed to walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma. So tonight, I call on every State to require that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn eighteen.
\
When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college. At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July. Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves middle-class families thousands of dollars. And give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs in the next five years.
\
Of course, it's not enough for us to increase student aid. We can't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we'll run out of money. States also need to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets. And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down. Recently, I spoke with a group of college presidents who've done just that. Some schools re-design courses to help students finish more quickly. Some use better technology. The point is, it's possible. So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you can't stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down. Higher education can't be a luxury? it's an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford.
\
Let's also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge: The fact that they aren't yet American citizens. Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of deportation. Others came more recently, to study business and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their degree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else.
\
That doesn't make sense.
\
I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration. That's why my Administration has put more boots on the border than ever before. That's why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office.
\
The opponents of action are out of excuses. We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now. But if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let's at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, and defend this country. Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship. I will sign it right away.
\
You see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country. That means women should earn equal pay for equal work. It means we should support everyone who's willing to work; and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs.
\
After all, innovation is what America has always been about. Most new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses. So let's pass an agenda that helps them succeed. Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow. Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs. Both parties agree on these ideas. So put them in a bill, and get it on my desk this year.
\
Innovation also demands basic research. Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally-financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched. New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet. Don't gut these investments in our budget. Don't let other countries win the race for the future. Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet; to new American jobs and new American industries.
\
Nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy. Over the last three years, we've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I'm directing my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources. Right now, American oil production is the highest that it's been in eight years. That's right - eight years. Not only that - last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past sixteen years.
\
But with only 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, oil isn't enough. This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy? a strategy that's cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs.
\
We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly one hundred years, and my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy. Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade. And I'm requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use. America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk.
\
The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don't have to choose between our environment and our economy. And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of 30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock? reminding us that Government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground.
\
What's true for natural gas is true for clean energy. In three years, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the world's leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries. Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled. And thousands of Americans have jobs because of it.
\
When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance. But he found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan. Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts. Today, it's hiring workers like Bryan, who said, ""I'm proud to be working in the industry of the future.""
\
Our experience with shale gas shows us that the payoffs on these public investments don't always come right away. Some technologies don't pan out; some companies fail. But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy. I will not walk away from workers like Bryan. I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here. We have subsidized oil companies for a century. That's long enough. It's time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that's rarely been more profitable, and double-down on a clean energy industry that's never been more promising. Pass clean energy tax credits and create these jobs.
\
We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives. The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change. But there's no reason why Congress shouldn't at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation. So far, you haven't acted. Well tonight, I will. I'm directing my Administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power three million homes. And I'm proud to announce that the Department of Defense, the world's largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history - with the navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year.
\
Of course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy. So here's another proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings. Their energy bills will be $100 billion lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, and more jobs for construction workers who need them. Send me a bill that creates these jobs.
\
Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America's infrastructure. So much of America needs to be rebuilt. We've got crumbling roads and bridges. A power grid that wastes too much energy. An incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world.
\
During the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge. After World War II, we connected our states with a system of highways. Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today.
\
In the next few weeks, I will sign an executive order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects. But you need to fund these projects. Take the money we're no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home.
\
There's never been a better time to build, especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest-hit when the housing bubble burst. Of course, construction workers weren't the only ones hurt. So were millions of innocent Americans who've seen their home values decline. And while Government can't fix the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn't have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief.
\
That's why I'm sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low interest rates. No more red tape. No more runaround from the banks. A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won't add to the deficit, and will give banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust.
\
Let's never forget: Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and a financial system that do the same. It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom: No bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts. An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.
\
We've all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who couldn't afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn't afford them. That's why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior. Rules to prevent financial fraud, or toxic dumping, or faulty medical devices, don't destroy the free market. They make the free market work better.
\
There is no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or too costly. In fact, I've approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his. I've ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that don't make sense. We've already announced over 500 reforms, and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than $10 billion over the next five years. We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill? because milk was somehow classified as an oil. With a rule like that, I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk.
\
I'm confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder. But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the gulf two years ago. I will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury pollution, or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean. I will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny you coverage, or charge women differently from men.
\
And I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules. The new rules we passed restore what should be any financial system's core purpose: Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home, start a business, or send a kid to college.
\
So if you're a big bank or financial institution, you are no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customers' deposits. You're required to write out a ""living will"" that details exactly how you'll pay the bills if you fail - because the rest of us aren't bailing you out ever again. And if you're a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company, the days of signing people up for products they can't afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices are over. Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one job: To look out for them.
\
We will also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect people's investments. Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because there's no real penalty for being a repeat offender. That's bad for consumers, and it's bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing. So pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count.
\
And tonight, I am asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorneys general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis. This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.
\
A return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help us protect our people and our economy. But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future.
\
Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile. People cannot afford losing $40 out of each paycheck this year. There are plenty of ways to get this done. So let's agree right here, right now: No side issues. No drama. Pass the payroll tax cut without delay.
\
When it comes to the deficit, we've already agreed to more than $2 trillion in cuts and savings. But we need to do more, and that means making choices. Right now, we're poised to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households. Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.
\
Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else? like education and medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans? Because if we're serious about paying down our debt, we can't do both.
\
The American people know what the right choice is. So do I. As I told the Speaker this summer, I'm prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors.
\
But in return, we need to change our tax code so that people like me, and an awful lot of Members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes. Tax reform should follow the Buffett rule: If you make more than $1 million a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes. And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires. In fact, if you're earning a million dollars a year, you shouldn't get special tax subsidies or deductions. On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families, your taxes shouldn't go up. You're the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages. You're the ones who need relief.
\
Now, you can call this class warfare all you want. But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that common sense.
\
We don't begrudge financial success in this country. We admire it. When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it's not because they envy the rich. It's because they understand that when I get tax breaks I don't need and the country can't afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference? like a senior on a fixed income; or a student trying to get through school; or a family trying to make ends meet. That's not right. Americans know it's not right. They know that this generation's success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to their country's future, and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility. That's how we'll reduce our deficit. That's an America built to last.
\
I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt; energy and health care. But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right now: Nothing will get done this year, or next year, or maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken.
\
Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical?
\
The greatest blow to confidence in our economy last year didn't come from events beyond our control. It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not. Who benefited from that fiasco?
\
I've talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street. But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad? and it seems to get worse every year.
\
Some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics. So together, let's take some steps to fix that. Send me a bill that bans insider trading by Members of Congress, and I will sign it tomorrow. Let's limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact. Let's make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress can't lobby Congress, and vice versa - an idea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington.
\
Some of what's broken has to do with the way Congress does its business these days. A simple majority is no longer enough to get anything? even routine business - passed through the Senate. Neither party has been blameless in these tactics. Now both parties should put an end to it. For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up or down vote within 90 days.
\
The executive branch also needs to change. Too often, it's inefficient, outdated and remote. That's why I've asked this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy so that our Government is leaner, quicker, and more responsive to the needs of the American people.
\
Finally, none of these reforms can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town. We need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around common sense ideas.
\
I'm a Democrat. But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: That Government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more. That's why my education reform offers more competition, and more control for schools and States. That's why we're getting rid of regulations that don't work. That's why our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a Government program.
\
On the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most about Government spending have supported federally-financed roads, and clean energy projects, and federal offices for the folks back home.
\
The point is, we should all want a smarter, more effective Government. And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, we can make real progress. With or without this Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow. But I can do a whole lot more with your help. Because when we act together, there is nothing the United States of America can't achieve.
\
That is the lesson we've learned from our actions abroad over the last few years.
\
Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies. From Pakistan to Yemen, the al-Qaida operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that they can't escape the reach of the United States of America.
\
From this position of strength, we've begun to wind down the war in Afghanistan. Ten thousand of our troops have come home. Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the end of this summer. This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that it is never again a source of attacks against America.
\
As the tide of war recedes, a wave of change has washed across the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunis to Cairo; from Sana'a to Tripoli. A year ago, Qadhafi was one of the world's longest-serving dictators? a murderer with American blood on his hands. Today, he is gone. And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change can't be reversed, and that human dignity can't be denied.
\
How this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain. But we have a huge stake in the outcome. And while it is ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well. We will stand against violence and intimidation. We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings? men and women; Christians, Muslims, and Jews. We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty.
\
And we will safeguard America's own security against those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests. Look at Iran. Through the power of our diplomacy, a world that was once divided about how to deal with Iran's nuclear program now stands as one. The regime is more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not relent. Let there be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal. But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations.
\
The renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe. Our oldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever. Our ties to the Americas are deeper. Our iron-clad commitment to Israel's security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history. We've made it clear that America is a Pacific power, and a new beginning in Burma has lit a new hope. From the coalitions we've built to secure nuclear materials, to the missions we've led against hunger and disease; from the blows we've dealt to our enemies; to the enduring power of our moral example, America is back.
\
Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn't know what they're talking about. That's not the message we get from leaders around the world, all of whom are eager to work with us. That's not how people feel from Tokyo to Berlin; from Cape Town to Rio; where opinions of America are higher than they've been in years. Yes, the world is changing; no, we can't control every event. But America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs? and as long as I'm President, I intend to keep it that way.
\
That's why, working with our military leaders, I have proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget. To stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I have already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing danger of cyber-threats.
\
Above all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it. As they come home, we must serve them as well as they served us. That includes giving them the care and benefits they have earned? which is why we've increased annual VA spending every year I've been President. And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our Nation.
\
With the bipartisan support of this Congress, we are providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets. Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for veterans and their families. And tonight, I'm proposing a Veterans Job Corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her.
\
Which brings me back to where I began. Those of us who've been sent here to serve can learn from the service of our troops. When you put on that uniform, it doesn't matter if you're black or white; Asian or Latino; conservative or liberal; rich or poor; gay or straight. When you're marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you, or the mission fails. When you're in the thick of the fight, you rise or fall as one unit, serving one Nation, leaving no one behind.
\
One of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden. On it are each of their names. Some may be Democrats. Some may be Republicans. But that doesn't matter. Just like it didn't matter that day in the Situation Room, when I sat next to Bob Gates? a man who was George Bush's defense secretary; and Hillary Clinton, a woman who ran against me for president.
\
All that mattered that day was the mission. No one thought about politics. No one thought about themselves. One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didn't deserve credit for the mission. It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit did their job? the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control; the translator who kept others from entering the compound; the troops who separated the women and children from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the stairs. More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other? because you can't charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know that there's someone behind you, watching your back.
\
So it is with America. Each time I look at that flag, I'm reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those fifty stars and those 13 stripes. No one built this country on their own. This Nation is great because we built it together. This Nation is great because we worked as a team. This Nation is great because we get each other's backs. And if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, there is no challenge too great; no mission too hard. As long as we're joined in common purpose, as long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, our future is hopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong.
\
Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.
\
untry, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed.
\
We should start with our tax code. Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas. Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and everyone knows it.
\
So let's change it. First, if you're a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn't get a tax deduction for doing it. That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home.
\
Second, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas. From now on, every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax. And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here.
\
Third, if you're an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut. If you're a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction you get for making products here. And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.
\
My message is simple. It's time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America. Send me these tax reforms, and I'll sign them right away.
\
We're also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world. Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years. With the bipartisan trade agreements I signed into law, we are on track to meet that goal - ahead of schedule. Soon, there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea. Soon, there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.
\
I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products. And I will not stand by when our competitors don't play by the rules. We've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration? and it's made a difference. Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires. But we need to do more. It's not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated. It's not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they're heavily subsidized.
\
Tonight, I'm announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trade practices in countries like China. There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders. And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing finance or new markets like Russia. Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you? America will always win.
\
I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States but can't find workers with the right skills. Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job. Think about that? openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work.
\
That's inexcusable. And we know how to fix it.
\
Jackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic. Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College. The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training. It paid Jackie's tuition, then hired her to help operate their plant.
\
I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did. Join me in a national commitment to train two million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job. My administration has already lined up more companies that want to help. Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte, Orlando, and Louisville are up and running. Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers? places that teach people skills that local businesses are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.
\
And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so that from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go for all the information and help they need. It's time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work.
\
These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today. But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier.
\
For less than one percent of what our nation spends on education each year, we've convinced nearly every state in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning? the first time that's happened in a generation.
\
But challenges remain. And we know how to solve them.
\
At a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced states to lay off thousands of teachers. We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over $250,000. A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance. Every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives. Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies? just to make a difference.
\
Teachers matter. So instead of bashing them, or defending the status quo, let's offer schools a deal. Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job, and reward the best ones. In return, grant schools flexibility: To teach with creativity and passion; to stop teaching to the test; and to replace teachers who just aren't helping kids learn.
\
We also know that when students aren't allowed to walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma. So tonight, I call on every State to require that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn eighteen.
\
When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college. At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July. Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves middle-class families thousands of dollars. And give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs in the next five years.
\
Of course, it's not enough for us to increase student aid. We can't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we'll run out of money. States also need to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets. And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down. Recently, I spoke with a group of college presidents who've done just that. Some schools re-design courses to help students finish more quickly. Some use better technology. The point is, it's possible. So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you can't stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down. Higher education can't be a luxury? it's an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford.
\
Let's also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge: The fact that they aren't yet American citizens. Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of deportation. Others came more recently, to study business and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their degree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else.
\
That doesn't make sense.
\
I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration. That's why my Administration has put more boots on the border than ever before. That's why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office.
\
The opponents of action are out of excuses. We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now. But if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let's at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, and defend this country. Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship. I will sign it right away.
\
You see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country. That means women should earn equal pay for equal work. It means we should support everyone who's willing to work; and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs.
\
After all, innovation is what America has always been about. Most new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses. So let's pass an agenda that helps them succeed. Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow. Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs. Both parties agree on these ideas. So put them in a bill, and get it on my desk this year.
\
Innovation also demands basic research. Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally-financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched. New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet. Don't gut these investments in our budget. Don't let other countries win the race for the future. Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet; to new American jobs and new American industries.
\
Nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy. Over the last three years, we've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I'm directing my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources. Right now, American oil production is the highest that it's been in eight years. That's right - eight years. Not only that - last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past sixteen years.
\
But with only 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, oil isn't enough. This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy? a strategy that's cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs.
\
We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly one hundred years, and my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy. Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade. And I'm requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use. America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk.
\
The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don't have to choose between our environment and our economy. And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of 30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock? reminding us that Government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground.
\
What's true for natural gas is true for clean energy. In three years, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the world's leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries. Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled. And thousands of Americans have jobs because of it.
\
When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance. But he found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan. Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts. Today, it's hiring workers like Bryan, who said, ""I'm proud to be working in the industry of the future.""
\
Our experience with shale gas shows us that the payoffs on these public investments don't always come right away. Some technologies don't pan out; some companies fail. But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy. I will not walk away from workers like Bryan. I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here. We have subsidized oil companies for a century. That's long enough. It's time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that's rarely been more profitable, and double-down on a clean energy industry that's never been more promising. Pass clean energy tax credits and create these jobs.
\
We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives. The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change. But there's no reason why Congress shouldn't at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation. So far, you haven't acted. Well tonight, I will. I'm directing my Administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power three million homes. And I'm proud to announce that the Department of Defense, the world's largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history - with the navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year.
\
Of course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy. So here's another proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings. Their energy bills will be $100 billion lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, and more jobs for construction workers who need them. Send me a bill that creates these jobs.
\
Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America's infrastructure. So much of America needs to be rebuilt. We've got crumbling roads and bridges. A power grid that wastes too much energy. An incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world.
\
During the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge. After World War II, we connected our states with a system of highways. Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today.
\
In the next few weeks, I will sign an executive order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects. But you need to fund these projects. Take the money we're no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home.
\
There's never been a better time to build, especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest-hit when the housing bubble burst. Of course, construction workers weren't the only ones hurt. So were millions of innocent Americans who've seen their home values decline. And while Government can't fix the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn't have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief.

127,"For most of my adult life, I have been in public service and engaged in the civic life of Dayton. I never considered myself an environmentalist and certainly not an expert in energy. But I believe that Dayton can chart its future by investing in clean and green energy. We can also lead the state of Ohio toward a new economy. The results of the city's impending community electric aggregation process will determine whether or not Dayton chooses this path. \Over past , Dayton made great progress in its commitment to protect the environment and conserve energy. In 2005, Dayton joined more than 400 communities in signing the U.S. Conference of Mayor's Climate Protection Agreement. Dayton became one of the first cities in the state to adopt a Sustainable Practices Policy that encourages the use of clean and renewable energy, alternative fuels and recycling. \Unfortunately for us, Ohio's General Assembly voted last summer to freeze the state's renewable portfolio standard, impeding our progress towards a clean energy economy. Adopted in 2008 under Gov. Ted Strickland, the standard mandated that by 2025, 25 percent of Ohio's electricity would be generated from renewable, advanced and energy efficient sources. Since its enactment, big coal-dominated utility companies such as FirstEnergy lobbied hard to return to the status quo, spread campaign contributions around, and finally got their way. As a result, Ohioans will pay higher electric bills for dirty energy produced by outdated and inefficient coal-fired power plants while big energy utilities continue to earn monopoly profits. \Ohio's clean energy standard not only served to reduce dangerous air emissions linked to climate change and asthma, it also created good jobs. By 2013, Ohio ranked as the top state for manufacturing wind energy parts and second for solar technologies, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. A Wright State University study estimated that by 2012, 31,000 Ohioans worked in alternative energy sectors. \Since our state lawmakers and Gov. Kasich froze the standard, however, the Pew report found that investment in this once booming sector has plummeted. \What has happened at the state level is not reflective of Dayton's values. Dayton has begun to retrofit many older buildings to be more energy efficient. Many of the traffic lights have been replaced with more efficient LED lights. The city's recycling program has been expanded to include larger residential recycling receptacles and curbside recycling. Also, the bike trails initiative will reduce carbon emissions while encouraging Dayton residents to be more active. If Dayton makes the right choices with community aggregation, we can continue to be an example for the rest of Ohio. \The good news is that Dayton can make a sustainable choice for clean energy with its community aggregation program. In the beginning of the year, the city of Dayton became certified for community aggregation. This allows to city to negotiate with energy suppliers for lower electricity rates for all the residents, to lower our electricity rates and, if we so choose, to purchase clean energy. \The city's request for proposals from potential energy suppliers should properly reflect its commitment to renewable, efficient and locally sourced energy. The cities of Cleveland and Cincinnati were able to secure 100 percent renewable energy at very competitive rates. \In order to be a relevant city in the future clean energy economy, Dayton must take the same bold step toward renewable energy. \Dayton must also make certain that the community aggregation process is transparent. This is a decision that will affect Dayton's residents. Dayton residents have a right to know more about the process, and to provide input. \As a former mayor of Dayton and a community organizer with the Miami Valley Organizing Collaborative, I have witnessed the city overcome immense obstacles by striving to protect the best interest and the wellbeing of residents. Let us continue on this path by making a sustainable community choice with our municipal aggregation program, keeping the future of the city and state in mind. \Richard Clay Dixon is the former mayor of Dayton.\Credit: By Richard Clay Dixon, Guest Columnist"
128,"
What kind of year has the first 6 months yielded for your business?
\
Has your place of business been producing efficiently?
\
I ask these questions because it is important to have your business run smoothly.
\
Many small business owners, facing one of the most challenging economic climates in recent memory, may be tempted to curtail or even suspend their company's charitable giving. After all, if a small business doesn't survive today, it can't very well give much in the way of charitable donations tomorrow.
\
But more and more small business owners are changing their thinking about charitable giving and coming to see it as not only a moral obligation but also a wise strategic investment in their businesses' long-term future - a way to do be ""doing well"" while ""doing good.""
\
Looking for ways to improve your bottom line without much capital investment?
\
Then the first place you should look at carefully is your business' energy usage. Replace incandescent lights with fluorescent fixtures and your lighting energy operating and maintenance costs can decrease up to 75 percent, if you are mostly on incandescent now.
\
Less than 5 percent of energy used by incandescent lamps generates useful light so the rest is merely waste heat, which also increases summer air conditioning costs (if you are lucky enough to have this).
\
There are now many choices of fluorescent fixtures. Just because you already have fluorescents doesn't necessarily mean you have the most energy efficient ones. The larger diameter, old style T-12 tubes have inefficient magnetic ballasts while the newer (smaller diameter) T-8 tubes have energy efficient electronic ballasts, which have a longer life and are 30 percent more efficient than the old ones.
\
Also, many spaces are over lighted and you may be able to reduce the number of tubes per fixture by 50 percent with equivalent savings.
\
Some new T-8 tubes (those with green end caps) also have lower mercury content, which is clearly good for the environment we all live in. In those areas with screw in incandescent bulbs, compact fluorescents are now available in a variety of wattage choices, warmer lighting color, and some can be used with dimmers. Compacts last 8-10 times longer than incandescent lamps and use approximately 1/3 of the energy, and though they do cost significantly more initially, they pay off in the long run. Many hardware and lighting stores sell these at greatly reduced prices because of incentives.
\
Exit signs now come in LED versions, which can be retrofitted for about $30 per fixture. Since LED exit signs are estimated to last 220,000 hours, this pays back in only 3 months over an incandescent fixture and still makes sense to use in replacing burnt compact fluorescent fixtures. If you still have any incandescent exit signs, this choice is a ""no-brainer!""
\
The same goes for motion sensors in little used areas and photo cells on security lights, which can also be compact fluorescents for greater energy savings.
\
For businesses with refrigeration equipment, frequent cleaning of condenser coils (a very thin layer of dust reduces efficiency dramatically) and proper ventilation of compressor areas can save considerable money over time. For businesses with industrial equipment. Peak Shaving can really save big bucks! Many businesses are hit with an additional monthly demand charge, which represents the highest 15 minute period of peak usage.
\
One way to reduce your demand charge is to look into replacing larger electrical users like electric hot water heaters and clothes dryers with gas ones. This can pay back in as little as three months. Also, see if your utility bill has off peak hours that some use could be shifted to, perhaps by using timers. For manufacturers. Peak Shaving, or reducing this peak demand charge, can be accomplished by simply not turning on every piece of heavy electrical using equipment at once (usually first thing in the morning), and staggering this process. If you have high amperage equipment, and a demand charge, you should be doing Peak Shaving.
\
This brings us to the electric bill. Don't just pay it without examining it and better yet, 4-6 months of bills or more, for patterns of heavy usage that could possibly be adjusted. There may be lots of energy saving dollars overlooked at nearly every business so why not take advantage of this at your business?
\
If your electric utility does not offer a free demand side management assessment, we can provide this overview assessment for you. Programmable, digital, set back thermostats can do the same for your heating and cooling bills. Why keep your business at 68 degrees when it's empty?
\
I can hear my mother yelling at me now. Why you have those lights on and you're not in the room? Or turn that television off if you are not watching it... my light bill is too high now.
\
At that time, I would be mad because I had to go back to my room and cut off the lights or TV that I had left on. But, little did I know, I would be confronted with the same issues once I started paying bills (smile).
\
Going Green is the newest term you hear being uses to save on energy. Going green is not just a trend spurred on by extreme environmentalist. The growing list of green products and increasing interest in the environment makes going green good business sense. People will shop according to their conscience and those who care about the environment are often willing to pay more for products that are environmentally sustainable.
\
It is not necessary to be an organic grocer or yoga instructor to run a green business. Businesses can become environmentally friendly by adopting a few simple techniques. Additionally, rather than increasing costs, many green business practices will actually help you save money in the long run.
\
Organic produce and green products managed to survive a recession.
\
This speaks volumes. There are people who want to protect the environment and choose environmentally friendly products whenever they are available. Retailers need to offer recycled, organic, and chemical-free merchandise, particularly in communities that are environmentally aware.
\
Printers should look for post-consumer recycled materials.
\
Restaurants and food purveyors have biodegradable food container options, and they can increase their quality by choosing local ingrethents whenever possible.

One of America's largest Presbyterian groups is doing what a lot of environmentalists are trying to do: hold FirstEnergy Corp. accountable for its efforts to combat global warming.
\
The Presbyterian Church (USA) said yesterday that, as a FirstEnergy minority shareholder, it has persuaded the utility to disclose its plans for achieving further reductions in greenhouse gases from its coal-fired power plants.
\
The Akron utility, one of the nation's largest, owns the coal-fired Bay Shore power plant in Oregon and several others. It also owns the Davis-Besse nuclear plant in Ottawa County, though that facility likely will not figure into the report. Off-site fabrication of nuclear fuel and other products within a nuclear plant generate greenhouse gases, but the plants themselves are not emitters.
\
The Presbyterian group has a membership of 2.3 million people in more than 10,000 congregations, including 14,000 ministers.
\
""We are very pleased that FirstEnergy recognizes the potential for reducing its carbon footprint by lowering greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency and demand-side management.
\
""This report will help stockholders assess the company's efforts to position itself for the future,"" said the Rev. Bill Somplatsky-Jarman of the Presbyterian Church (USA).
\
A group spokesman, Mindy Marchal, said Presbyterians view global warming as an issue of environmental justice ""to protect the world God gave us and to be good stewards.""
\
""We see this as a social justice ministry. We're very dedicated to the environment and the well-being of the environment to nurture and protect all God's children,"" she said.
\
The request was made through a shareholder resolution with help from Ceres, a national network of investors, environmental organizations, and public interest groups.
\
FirstEnergy officials agreed to document their climate-change work rather than send the resolution through to its board of directors for a vote.
\
Utility spokesman Ellen Raines said the two sides agreed on Dec. 31 as the deadline for the study's release.
\
""We've worked to be environmentally responsible in all of our activities,"" she said.
\
The Presbyterian Church (USA) had asked for the report by Sept. 1.
\
Ms. Raines said it agreed to the later date after hearing FirstEnergy's concerns about Gov. Ted Strickland's energy plan, which calls for more renewable energy and fewer greenhouse gases.
\
The plan is ""on the front burner legislatively"" with the Ohio Senate, she said.
\
FirstEnergy is one of several utilities Ceres has been negotiating with in conjunction with or on behalf of other groups.
\
Ceres claims power generating is responsible for 40 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
\
A record 54 global-warming shareholder resolutions were filed with U.S. companies this year, nearly double the 2006 figure.
\
Utilities, oil and coal producers, airlines, and home builders were targeted, according to Ceres.

Voluntary effort aims at greenhouse gases
\
By Mike Boyer
\
The Cincinnati Enquirer
\
Cinergy Corp. will reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases, linked by researchers to global warming, by 5 percent by 2010, the company will announce today.
\
The Cincinnati-based utility, under fire from environmentalists for not completing a nearly 3-year-old pollution settlement with the federal government, is the first predominantly coal-fired utility to make a voluntary commitment to reduce greenhouse gases.
\
Cinergy said it would spend $21 million to reduce its emissions of carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases below the company's 2000 level of 67 million tons.
\
It isn't known whether ratepayers or stockholders will pay for the improvements, because Cinergy hasn't decided how it will spend the money. There's a residential rate freeze in Ohio through 2005, but some of the costs could be passed on to customers in Kentucky and Indiana.
\
CEO James Rogers said the commitment fulfills the utility's 2002 decision to sign on as a charter member of President Bush's Climate Leaders program.
\
As an alternative to the Kyoto accord on global warming, Bush asked private industry to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Cynthia Cummins, manager of the Climate Leaders program for the federal Environmental Protection Agency, said 46 companies have agreed to join the program. Only 10 have announced their commitment to reduce greenhouse gases, she said.
\
Cinergy is the first of five utilities to announce its goal, she said.
\
""We believe it's an aggressive target,"" she said.
\
""This is very significant,"" said Jessica Holliday, director of the Partnership for Climate Action at Environmental Defense.
\
To fulfill the commitment, Cinergy has agreed to work with Environmental Defense, a New York City nonprofit organization working on market-based environmental solutions, on ways to achieve the goal and pick a third party to audit Cinergy's performance.
\
""Cinergy isn't afraid of committing to real results,"" she said. ""It's the most aggressive U.S. utility target I'm aware of.""
\
While applauding Cinergy's commitment, Kurt Walzer, spokesman for the Ohio Environmental Council, said, ""The problem is we don't have national policy for dealing with heat-trapping gases from coal-fired generating plants. You can't deal with global warming through voluntary measures,"" he said.
\
Rogers disagreed.
\
""We recognize the potential significance of climate change and believe that voluntary programs can be implemented more quickly and effectively than traditional regulatory programs,"" he said.
\
The parent of Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co. said it plans to use a combination of new technology, carbon sequestration, demand-side management, energy conservation, improving the efficiency of its generation plants and emission offsets to achieve the goal.
\
Rogers said Cinergy's commitment strikes a balance between the president's voluntary approach and the more severe requirements of bipartisan legislation introduced by U.S. Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.
\
The McCain-Lieberman bill would require reductions to 2000 levels by 2010 and to 1990 levels by 2016.
\
Rogers said Cinergy's commitment is a good business decision because it reduces the company's greenhouse gas emissions while allowing it to continue burning coal to provide lower-cost power to customers.
\
The $21 million commitment includes research and development into new technology to deal with greenhouse gases. Cinergy said it would strive to spend at least two-thirds of the money on projects to reduce emissions from its generation, transmission and distribution systems.
\
Because Cinergy sees about 2 percent growth in its electric generation annually, the total greenhouse gas reduction will be greater than the target, Rogers said.
\
Holliday agreed. She said setting a target leads to goals being achieved quicker and exceeding expectations.
\
Cinergy, which said its electric generating plants account for about 1 percent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, said it would report annually on progress toward the 2010 goal and evaluate the goal again in 2010 to set another target beyond that.
\
Besides carbon dioxide, the other greenhouse gases are methane, nitrogen oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbon and sulfur hexafluoride.
\
The company's voluntary commitment comes just two weeks after the EPA said it lacks authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from automobiles.
\
The agency said Congress hadn't granted it authority to deal with carbon dioxide as it had with other pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.

\
Carbon dioxide: It's a naturally occurring gas, but its levels also can be increased by human activities, because carbon dioxide is one of the byproducts when a fuel isn't burned completely. In this case, the fuel is typically coal, which is carbon-based.
\
Carbon dioxide has been labeled a ""greenhouse"" gas because it has the ability to trap heat in the atmosphere. How these gases pose a threat to humans and the environment through global warming has been hotly debated in the United States, although many other nations are acting to reduce them.
\
Carbon dioxide shouldn't be confused with carbon monoxide, although both are colorless, odorless gases.
\
Carbon monoxide: This is a component of motor vehicle exhaust, which contributes about 56 percent of all carbon monoxide emissions nationwide, according to the EPA. Power plants contribute little to carbon monoxide pollution, which can cause health problems for people with heart conditions. Carbon monoxide also can affect the central nervous system and help contribute to smog.
\
The federal and state governments regulate air quality for six major kinds of pollutants, including carbon monoxide.
\
Two other pollutants on that list, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, are strongly linked to power plants. In fact, Cinergy reached a tentative deal several years ago to end a federal lawsuit over such emissions from two of its plants.
\
Sulfur dioxide: EPA says more than 65 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions come from electric utilities - especially those that burn coal. Sulfur dioxide can cause breathing problems for people with asthma. It's also associated with acid rain (which some think harms lakes and streams in areas downwind of power plants), as well as damaging forests and crops and accelerating the deterioration of paint and stone building materials.
\
Nitrogen oxides: This is the generic term for a group of highly reactive gases, all of which contain nitrogen and oxygen in varying amounts. Many are colorless and odorless (although nitrogen dioxide, along with particles in the air, can often be seen as a reddish-brown layer over many urban areas). EPA says 49 percent of the nation's nitrogen oxide pollution can be traced to vehicles, while 27 percent comes from power plants. Nitrogen oxides are converted by sunlight to form ozone or smog pollution, which damages human lungs. They also are among the greenhouse gases and have been linked to water pollution in such areas as the Chesapeake Bay.

Voluntary effort aims at greenhouse gases
\
By Mike Boyer
\
The Cincinnati Enquirer
\
Cinergy Corp. will reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases, linked by researchers to global warming, by 5 percent by 2010, the company will announce today.
\
The Cincinnati-based utility, under fire from environmentalists for not completing a nearly 3-year-old pollution settlement with the federal government, is the first predominantly coal-fired utility to make a voluntary commitment to reduce greenhouse gases.
\
Cinergy said it would spend $21 million to reduce its emissions of carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases below the company's 2000 level of 67 million tons.
\
It isn't known whether ratepayers or stockholders will pay for the improvements, because Cinergy hasn't decided how it will spend the money. There's a residential rate freeze in Ohio through 2005, but some of the costs could be passed on to customers in Kentucky and Indiana.
\
CEO James Rogers said the commitment fulfills the utility's 2002 decision to sign on as a charter member of President Bush's Climate Leaders program.
\
As an alternative to the Kyoto accord on global warming, Bush asked private industry to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Cynthia Cummins, manager of the Climate Leaders program for the federal Environmental Protection Agency, said 46 companies have agreed to join the program. Only 10 have announced their commitment to reduce greenhouse gases, she said.
\
Cinergy is the first of five utilities to announce its goal, she said.
\
""We believe it's an aggressive target,"" she said.
\
""This is very significant,"" said Jessica Holliday, director of the Partnership for Climate Action at Environmental Defense.
\
To fulfill the commitment, Cinergy has agreed to work with Environmental Defense, a New York City nonprofit organization working on market-based environmental solutions, on ways to achieve the goal and pick a third party to audit Cinergy's performance.
\
""Cinergy isn't afraid of committing to real results,"" she said. ""It's the most aggressive U.S. utility target I'm aware of.""
\
While applauding Cinergy's commitment, Kurt Walzer, spokesman for the Ohio Environmental Council, said, ""The problem is we don't have national policy for dealing with heat-trapping gases from coal-fired generating plants. You can't deal with global warming through voluntary measures,"" he said.
\
Rogers disagreed.
\
""We recognize the potential significance of climate change and believe that voluntary programs can be implemented more quickly and effectively than traditional regulatory programs,"" he said.
\
The parent of Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co. said it plans to use a combination of new technology, carbon sequestration, demand-side management, energy conservation, improving the efficiency of its generation plants and emission offsets to achieve the goal.
\
Rogers said Cinergy's commitment strikes a balance between the president's voluntary approach and the more severe requirements of bipartisan legislation introduced by U.S. Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.
\
The McCain-Lieberman bill would require reductions to 2000 levels by 2010 and to 1990 levels by 2016.
\
Rogers said Cinergy's commitment is a good business decision because it reduces the company's greenhouse gas emissions while allowing it to continue burning coal to provide lower-cost power to customers.
\
The $21 million commitment includes research and development into new technology to deal with greenhouse gases. Cinergy said it would strive to spend at least two-thirds of the money on projects to reduce emissions from its generation, transmission and distribution systems.
\
Because Cinergy sees about 2 percent growth in its electric generation annually, the total greenhouse gas reduction will be greater than the target, Rogers said.
\
Holliday agreed. She said setting a target leads to goals being achieved quicker and exceeding expectations.
\
Cinergy, which said its electric generating plants account for about 1 percent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, said it would report annually on progress toward the 2010 goal and evaluate the goal again in 2010 to set another target beyond that.
\
Besides carbon dioxide, the other greenhouse gases are methane, nitrogen oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbon and sulfur hexafluoride.

COLUMBUS -- Statehouse developments related to Substitute Senate Bill 221, legislation revising the state's energy policies related to electricity and renewable/advanced energy resources:
\
New bill
\
House Speaker Jon Husted, a Republican from Kettering, announced the introduction of a new bill that would establish benchmarks for renewable and advanced energy usage and efficiency efforts and the creation of a state fund to provide incentives for green energy growth.
\
The new legislation will be considered by the House Public Utilities Committee, with plans to wrap its contents into Sub. SB 221. That committee, meanwhile, had its 12th hearing on the legislation, with testimony from only one individual: Walter C. Roman, from the Worthington area, told lawmakers about a process he has developed for turning municipal waste into pellets that can be burned as fuel.
\
The hearing room was about half full of onlookers; there was no discussion of the new legislation unveiled earlier in the day. Husted would provide no details on the timeframe for considering the new bill or the introduction of substitute legislation.
\
Mixed reactions
\
Lawmakers, Gov. Ted Strickland and proponents and opponents of the legislation were quick to release statements on Husted's legislation announcement:
\
-- Rep. Michael Skindell, a Democrat from Cleveland who introduced a comparable bill in September, said: ""I take some personal satisfaction that the annual benchmarks and energy efficiency standards I created in legislation are being recognized as solid ideas. I wish I had gotten the opportunity to fight for my proposals through the legislative process, but I am now hopeful that the people of Ohio will soon benefit from these plans.""
\
-- Strickland called for lawmakers to act quickly on the legislation: ""If we want to create Ohio jobs we must pass a comprehensive energy bill as soon as possible -- a bill that provides predictable, reliable and affordable electric prices to protect Ohio businesses and consumers. I have heard from businesses throughout Ohio that without the assurance of reliable and affordable energy prices, their ability to plan for a strong economic future is greatly diminished. In fact, just today an Ohio newspaper is reporting that a steel company, Steel Development LLC, has ruled Ohio out of a potential $1 billion investment because it feels that Ohio's energy prices are unpredictable.""
\
-- David Rinebolt, executive director of Ohio Partners for Affordable Energy, said: ""It is unclear which of the benchmarks apply to energy efficiency. The proposed bill is internally inconsistent. That makes it tough to determine if customers will see the benefits of efficiency.
\
""It's also likely that customers as a class will not save any money through efficiency under the Speaker's proposal.
\
The draft bill permits utility companies to collect any revenue lost through declining sales -- a concept called decoupling -- at the discretion of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. In other words, don't save and you pay, or save and you still pay.""
\
-- Lynn Olman, chairman of the Alliance for Real Energy Options, said: ""The Speaker's leadership on this bill is to be applauded as he is putting Ohio on track to become a leader in the development of and commitment to the use of renewable energy to meet Ohio's future energy needs. The Alliance for Real Energy Options strongly supports the adoption of an advanced and renewable portfolio standard, energy efficiency standard and other sustainable energy policies as part of a comprehensive review of the structure of the Ohio electric industry.""
\
-- Eric Burkland, president of the Ohio Manufacturers Association, said: "" We learned today that uncertainty over electricity costs has taken Ohio out of contention for a new steel mill. Time is running to fix this problem and fix it right.""
\
-- Janine Migden-Ostrander from the Ohio Consumers' Counsel, said: ""We commend Governor Strickland for putting renewable energy and energy efficiency on the front burner. And we commend Speaker Husted for adding important details to ensure economic benefits will be gained for consumers and businesses.
\
The time is now to capture the untapped potential for green energy and technologies available to reduce our usage. The inclusion of benchmarks to ensure that utilities make needed progress and the adoption of a more ambitious energy efficiency standard matter greatly and will help lawmakers and consumers send the message that they care about managing the costs of power, both on their monthly bills and on the environment.""
"
133,"
COLUMBUS - Measures introduced Feb. 21, to improve Ohio's use of renewable energy and help lower consumers' demand for electricity received backing from the Office of the Ohio Consumers' Counsel, the residential utility consumer advocate.
\
""We commend Governor [Ted] Strickland for putting renewable energy and energy efficiency on the front burner,"" Janine Migden-Ostrander, Ohio Consumers' Counsel, said. ""And we commend [House] Speaker [John] Husted for adding important details to ensure economic benefits will be gained for consumers and businesses. The time is now to capture the untapped potential for green energy and technologies available to reduce our usage.
\
""The inclusion of benchmarks to ensure that utilities make needed progress and the adoption of a more ambitious energy efficiency standard matter greatly and will help lawmakers and consumers send the message that they care about managing the costs of power, both on their monthly bills and on the environment.""
\
Among the proposals introduced by Husted were a requirement that 22 percent of Ohio's electricity consumption be reduced through energy efficiency measures with benchmarks through 2025, along with renewable energy benchmarks for utilities to meet through 2025, and penalties for utilities that fail to comply.
\
The proposals are consistent with measures the OCC has supported throughout the consideration of Senate Bill 221, Ohio's energy policy bill, as well as House Bill 357, which addresses renewable energy and energy efficiency standards.

134,"ZANESVILLE -- The Zanesville-Muskingum County Chamber of Commerce is opposed to Gov. John Kasich's proposed tax hike on drilling companies.\The chamber outlined its official position Wednesday, the same day a poll found voters strongly favor the governor's proposal to raise taxes on big oil and gas drillers to fund modest income-tax relief.\The Quinnipiac University poll, released Wednesday, found voters favor the idea 60 percent to 32 percent. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\The plan has stalled at the Statehouse.\In a statement released Wednesday, chamber president Tom Poorman wrote that the chamber is not necessarily against an increase in the future but that at least for now, the potential cost outweighs the potential benefits.\""Higher taxes will make it more difficult to compete with other places,"" Poorman wrote. ""We are not willing to risk this new opportunity.""\Currently, operators pay 20 cents per barrel on crude oil and up to 3 cents per 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas. There is no separate tax on natural gas liquids.\Kasich has proposed raising the severance tax to 4 percent. Operators would pay a lower 1.5 percent rate for up to two years to allow them to recoup startup costs.\The governor has said Ohio's current tax rates are ridiculously low and that oil and gas companies ""pay nothing"" on highly prized natural gas liquids.\In his proposal, Kasich also suggests using the increased revenue to lower the state's income tax level.\Lower income taxes would be nice, Poorman wrote, but right now the priority needs to be economic growth.\Oil and gas companies and other industry leaders also have come out almost en masse against the proposal.\A 4 percent tax is enough to stifle investment in southeast Ohio, said Jerry James, president of the Marietta-based Artex Oil Co., in an interview with the Times Recorder in April.\There are 27 different shale plays in the country, James said, about one-third of which are ""wet"" like the Utica play. If oil and gas companies don't like the business environment in Ohio, they'll just go somewhere else, he said.\""It's very dangerous for Ohio to think that we're the only game in town,"" James said. ""This opportunity is very mobile. It will leave here in a flash if we create a hostile business"" environment.\David Hill, president of David R. Hill Inc., an oil and gas exploration company, shared similar opinions. Hill is from Zanesville and would love to see the area prosper from increased oil and gas activity, but it's not guaranteed, he said.\""We Ohioans can't go anywhere else, but the shale opportunity can,"" he said, ""and (it) will.""\A 4 percent rate in Ohio still would be lower than the 5 percent severance tax levied in neighboring Michigan and West Virginia, but more than the 0.1 percent charged in Illinois. Pennsylvania has no severance tax on oil and gas but recently authorized local governments to impose a drilling ""impact fee.""\So far in Muskingum County, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources has only reported three Utica permits, two to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and one to Enervest Operating LLC.\The Associated Press contributed to this story.\hsparling@zanesvilletimesrecorder.com; (740) 450-6758\ID_Code: BA-205100303"
135,"The Ohio House gave broad bipartisan support to a 10.7-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase Thursday, but state transportation officials question whether that’s enough to fund additional major construction projects. \Chris Kershner, vice president of the state Transportation Review and Advisory Council, the body that prioritizes and funds major new road construction projects, sent a letter to House leaders Wednesday warning that a 10.7-cent gas tax increase would still leave “no new funding commitments on transportation projects in Ohio for the next 10 years.” \“This means there will be $0 that can be committed to new projects through TRAC, which will directly impact ODOT’s ability to meet the evolving infrastructure needs of our state and our future business community,” said Kershner, who also wrote in his capacity as vice president of the Dayton Chamber of Commerce. \Several Dayton-area infrastructure projects would be in jeopardy, he said while supporting DeWine’s proposed 18-cent increase. Columbus is facing similar issues. \For example, five phases of the Interstate 70/​71 interchange project are already underway, but if the state is going to finish the final seven phases of the project, state officials say they need more than the House-passed increase — which includes a 20-cent tax hike on diesel fuel — that would total $845 million once fully implemented. \“It would not cover even ODOT’s routine maintenance needs, let alone allow us to make any significant improvements such as fixing I-70 and I-71 through Downtown,” said Matt Bruning, spokesman for the Ohio Department of Transportation. \Still, it was no small feat to see a Republican-dominated House that balked last session at relatively tiny vehicle fee increases to pass what amounts to a 38-percent gas tax increase. The House plan also would charge a $200 registration fee for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids each time a vehicle is registered or renewed. \“Everyone using the roads will now help maintain them,” said Rep. Scott Oelslager, R-Canton, chairman of the House Finance Committee, calling the full package “the largest economic development package in recent Ohio history.” \Rep. Jack Cera, D-Bellaire, agreed. “This is one of the most major jobs bills that we have. We’re proud of the work we’ve done in a bipartisan way.” \Forty of 60 Republicans supported the budget bill, so votes from House Democrats were needed to pass it. Democrats said they turned that leverage into some key provisions, including increasing public transit funding from $40 million per year in DeWine’s budget to $100 million per year, and shifting an extra 5 percent of the new gas tax money to local governments. \The public transit funding “is a historic commitment that will provide enormous benefits for people throughout Ohio,” said Rep. David Leland, D-Columbus. \Better public transportation helps Ohio’s disabled population, helps expected moms get to doctors and clinics, connects people with jobs and helps the environment, Leland said. \At DeWine’s request, the House on Thursday agreed to phase-in the gas tax increase over two years, starting with 7 cents on Oct. 1, instead of the three years. The diesel tax would still be a three-year phase-in. \The House-passed tax increase, which now heads to a more-skeptical Senate, would raise an extra $1.1 billion for roadwork over two years, compared to the nearly $2.5 billion that would have been generated under DeWine’s budget proposal. \The budget bill passed 71-27. Of the 10 Franklin County House members, seven voted for it. Reps. Adam Miller, D-Columbus, Mary Lightbody, D-Westerville, and Beth Liston, D-Dublin, voted against it. \Liston said working families and seniors “should not have to pay more in taxes to make up for failed leadership over the past eight years.” \Lightbody’s concerns were similar: “I don’t believe supporting a tax increase today can make up for the Statehouse failures of the past.” \While municipal officials like the additional transportation funding in the budget, they are concerned about some policy changes. \City officials, including those in Columbus who voted last year to ban low-speed electric scooters from sidewalks, are worried that lawmakers are about to step on them again. The budget bill would create new regulations for the stand-up devices, including allowing them on sidewalks. City advocates worry the change will preempt local ordinances. \The bill also takes another swing at significantly restricting the use of traffic cameras by requiring cities to file all camera-related cases in municipal court, rather than an administrative hearing. It also would subtract fine revenue collected by the city from the city’s share of state local government funds. \The bill also would no longer require Ohio drivers to have a front license plate. Currently 19 states do not require a front plate, including all five states surrounding Ohio. \jsiegel@dispatch.com \@phrontpage \CREDIT: JIM SIEGEL"
136,"Raising the federal gas tax to help pay for highways and restrain federal deficits is a good idea whose time never seems to come. It has been a quarter-century since the last increase, during which time the per-gallon tax of 18.4 cents has lost nearly 40 percent of its value in real terms. \Meanwhile, fuel efficiency and highway usage both grew. In 2013, the average American paid 42 percent less via the gas tax than in 1993; this diminished contribution went for the upkeep and expansion of roads on which that motorist was driving 4 percentmore miles. \With President Donald Trump and Congress now possibly about to pivot to long-postponed infrastructure modernization legislation, which will have to be paid for, change might just be imaginable. Or so the U.S. Chamber of Commerce seems to believe. The Chamber, a powerful business lobby with close Republican ties, has announced a push for a 25-cents-per-gallon increase, phased in over five years and indexed to inflation. \This is not a brand-new cause for the Chamber, which has backed such proposals in the past. Yet the case the organization articulates is particularly strong; if reasoning were the only consideration, as opposed to Congress’ reflexive terror at raising taxes, the plan would be adopted by a voice vote in both the House and Senate and speedily signed by the president. \The federal trust fund that pays for highways and transit projects is funded for the next two years — on paper; Congress employed a lot of budgetary gimmicks. By 2027, however, the fund will have accumulated a $138 billion deficit, unless it slashes planned spending by that much. \The Chamber’s proposed tax would raise $394 billion over the next decade, enough to restore the trust fund to solvency — with money left over for additional projects and a smidgen of deficit reduction. \The typical driver would pay about $108 more per year, but that could be offset by the benefits of better roads, in the form of reduced traffic and less vehicle damage. It’s also a rough — too rough, admittedly — proxy for a carbon tax, which would help the environment. \Trump’s off-the-cuff remarks rarely, if ever, constitute reliable guides to his actual policy thinking, as recent events remind us. \However, in May 2017, he said he would “consider” raising the federal gas tax to pay for his promised increase in infrastructure spending. And six months later, National Economic Council DirectorGary Cohn reportedly backed that up by floating a 7-cent-per-gallon hike. \Nothing came of these comments, but they were rare flashes of fiscal responsibility from the same bunch that brought us a $1.5 trillion tax cut paid for by new projected borrowing. We are mindful of the fact that a gas-tax increase would nullify some of the small tax cut that lower- and middle-income Americans got from that bad bill. \That is an argument for trying, over time, to undo the tax cut’s most wasteful giveaways to the wealthy, not for abandoning fiscal responsibility yet again when it comes to funding infrastructure. \— Washington Post \"
137,"
COLUMBUS -- The Republican leaders of the House and Senate said an increase in tax rates on oil and gas produced via horizontal hydraulic fracturing would not be included in the $71 billion-plus biennial budget, as sought by Gov. John Kasich.
\
Instead, Senate President Keith Faber (R-Celina) and House Speaker Cliff Rosenberger (R-Clarksville) said a task force of the two chambers would continue negotiations over the summer, with an eye toward a compromise package later in the year.
\
The move would place the severance tax before a new Ohio 2020 Tax Policy Study Commission, with a deadline of Oct. 1 for submitting its recommendations to the general assembly.
\
Faber had voiced optimism a severance tax increase could be part of the biennial budget, but Rosenberger told reporters last week his chamber would not support the inclusion in the spending plan for the next two fiscal years.
\
Both said Tuesday, while the different sides of the issue were closer to agreement, there wasn't enough time before the budget's required enactment July 1 to complete negotiations.
\
""Make no mistake, there's going to be a solution to this problem,"" Faber said. ""And lest one side think that they can drag it out ... that's not an option, because there will be a solution.... The goal is to negotiate and find something that works for everybody.""
\
The Kasich administration voiced disappointment with the decision.
\
""Helping Ohioans preserve and expand the success we've created together in the past four years is the governor's top priority,"" Rob Nichols, the governor's spokesman, said in a released statement. ""Ohioans created more than 350,000 jobs because, among other reasons, we've cut taxes by $3 billion -- and modernizing severance taxes helps fuel even more tax cuts to keep that growth going. Updating this outdated tax policy remains a priority for the administration, especially since new technologies in recent years have completely transformed this industry. We're obviously disappointed with the delay. We need to move forward with what's best for Ohio.""
\
Industry representatives are supportive of the study commission, though they continue to oppose a severance tax increase.
\
""While we remain opposed to an increase in the severance tax rate, especially during this extremely difficult commodity price environment, we are open to continuing discussions on this issue,"" Shawn Bennett, executive vice president of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, said in a released statement. ""... It is apparent that a more thorough and deliberative discussion is needed to examine the state's over-arching tax policies.""
\
And a Democratic lawmaker from eastern Ohio also is supportive of the study effort.
\
""I think at this point it would not be the right thing to do to stick this severance tax in the budget at the last minute without any hearings or any opportunity for people at the local level to give any input,"" said Sen. Lou Gentile (D-Steubenville). ""... I think that the study committee is a worthwhile effort to arrive at a solution to this issue. Bottom line for me and the people that I represent is that we need a majority of this revenue to be reinvested in the communities that are producing this oil and gas. That is going to be my position to make sure that distribution comes back to the people who are responsible, the communities that are involved in the day-to-day shale play.""
\
The governor and other proponents of a severance tax increase say the existing rate is too low, the increase they're proposing would keep Ohio's rates lower than other states, and the proceeds could be used to cut income tax rates for all residents and provide funding for infrastructure and other projects in communities near eastern Ohio's emerging shale oilfield.
\
Opponents fall into a couple of different camps. Some say the state should not be increasing the severance tax rate at all, given dropping commodity prices and the potential for stifling investment in Ohio by oil and gas producers. Others say the proposed increases aren't high enough, or more of the proceeds should be directed to eastern Ohio communities affected by the growing industry.
\
Kasich and Republican lawmakers have been at odds over the severance tax issue for several years. The governor has proposed an increase on oil and gas produced via fracking in past budget-related bills and Republican lawmakers have stripped the language from the resulting legislation each time.
\
Tuesday's announcement from Republican lawmakers signals the closest the sides have come in their negotiations.
\
""This is an important movement and an important moment for the unity and mutual respect, and I look forward to finishing this work towards a meaningful public policy in the weeks ahead,"" Faber said.
\
Faber and Rosenberger did not offer specifics on rate increases being considered other policy changes that could be included.
\
They committed to completing the study process by Oct. 1. Lawmakers would then have to pick up any recommendations and move them as separate legislation.
\
""The deadline's a hard deadline,"" Faber said. ""There was a lot of discussion about whether this was just a stalling tactic. ... I think a lot of progress was made. I think they have a foundational template as to where to start from. There are still some nuances that need to be negotiated, but I think that template gave us great promise.""

138,"For every barrel of oil and unit of natural gas pumped, Ohio gets pennies and dimes in tax revenue as neighboring states rake in nickels and dollars.\With Utica Shale drilling expected to boom in Ohio in coming years, some experts want changes to the state's tax policy before billions of dollars of oil and natural gas is tapped.\Members of both major political parties and the governor's office indicate a change is unlikely. A lobbyist for the industry said he's sure it won't happen.\Ohio's severance tax, named so because it ""severs"" a finite resource from the earth, raised an estimated $3 million last year from oil and gas.

John Kasich is not pursuing a severance tax increase, according to his spokesman, Rob Nichols.\His administration, however, is considering leasing state park land to oil and gas companies to cash in on leasing and royalty money.\""It is something that we are open to and something we think could be done with minimal destruction to the environment and could potentially yield very important state funding for our parks,"" Nichols said.\Stewart, a member of the Senate committee on agriculture and natural resources, said ""for once we have a favorable tax structure, and I'm not really seeing a need to mess with that.""\Ohio Rep.

I respond to the ""Your voice"" column, ""Tell the truth about oil drilling"" (April 26). First, I want to correct the statement that there is no sign of damage today from the Exxon Valdez oil spill off the coast of Alaska. In December 2003, Science magazine came out with a study that found that oil degrades at different rates depending on the environment - and can still be found on beaches in Prince William Sound today. Oil spills do damage the environment.
\
I couldn't agree more that it is important for America to gain more oil independence. But what we really need is to decrease our reliance on crude oil through energy efficiency and alternative sources. Because America has only 3 percent of the world's oil reserves yet consumes 25 percent of the world's oil, we will never drill our way to oil independence.

We can't worry about every little mess
\
It's refreshing to read an article in which someone uses common sense. I'm referring to the ""Your voice"" column ""Tell the truth about oil drilling"" (April 26).
\
Finally, someone stands up and speaks the truth; the world won't end just because we make a little mess here or there. Mother nature knows how to correct any mistake and will keep doing it long after man has disappeared.

Mocking pope is cowardly, impolite
\
While Jim Borgman takes delight in mocking Pope John Paul II (April 27), most Catholics take offense at such mean-spirited deprecation of the vicar of Christ.
\
This is the third cartoon within three months that demeans Christ, Christians and the pope. It is not funny. It is insulting. It is not provocative. It is cowardly. As a rule, religion is not an appropriate topic for mockery. I notice that Borgman observes this common courtesy with respect to all faiths, except Christianity. Show some guts. Take on the real bad guys. Just a clue - the pope is not one of them.

Polls show Kerry can't beat Bush
\
Sen. John Kerry can try to manufacture outrage all he wants. The American people are increasingly siding with President Bush in the polls because his policies are working. With the recovery picking up steam, and the unemployment rate here in Ohio down, people are choosing common sense over huge tax hikes, obscenely expensive socialized medicine programs, gas tax hikes and frivolous lawsuits.
\
California has already demonstrated for us what Kerry's ideas do to the economy, and we just don't need that.

Lies about Kerry's service galling
\
It's not easy to promote a record that includes launching an unnecessary war based on faulty intelligence. It's also difficult to defend an economic record that includes millions of lost jobs and skyrocketing energy prices. To divert attention from these failures, the Bush administration now foists the same lies about Sen. John Kerry that it once used to smear fellow Vietnam veterans Sen. John McCain and former Sen. Max Cleland. It's particularly galling that Kerry is being attacked in the name of a president who failed to show up for his own military duties in the early 1970s.

Shame on those glamorizing truancy
\
Want to know what's wrong in our world? Here's one clue - the photo and caption ""Skippin' and slidin'"" (April 23). Let's stop glamorizing crime. We have a compulsory education law. This says that it is against the law not to go to school. Senior Skip Day should not be treated as funny or a silly prank or a tradition. Let's stop telling our kids it is OK to break a law.
\
These kids should be punished, a real and tough punishment so that they won't do it. Shame on the Enquirer for glamorizing this crime, and shame on you, Covington Catholic High School, for allowing such an activity.

Enough! Yes, the cicadas are about to emerge, and yes, they are ugly, annoying and noisy, but do the readers of the Enquirer have to be bombarded with stories about the cicadas every single day? This topic has ceased being a news story, and the Enquirer's coverage of the insects has descended to the realm of beating a dead horse.

142,"We're all in a hurry these days. Sometimes I feel like my kids have made it their mission to make me late to everything, so there's always a temptation to treat speed limits more like suggestions. Along my daily route on the northwestern portion of I-275, I see most other drivers doing the same, often exceeding the limit by 10 mph or more. We may save a few minutes here and there by speeding, but is it worth the potential costs?\First, let's talk money. The Cincinnati area's typical highway speed limits are set within the 55-65 mph range, yet the U.S. Department of Energy asserts that 50 mph is the most fuel-efficient speed to drive most vehicles. For every 5 mph above 50 mph, it's like paying 19 cents more per gallon of gas on average. Fuel prices are expected to jump this summer to the highest they've been in years and a federal gas tax of up to 25 cents per gallon is proposed. That's going to hit the budgets of many of us hard, so slowing down is one way to cut costs.\To prove to myself the savings are real, I did my own experiment last year. I tracked my miles per gallon highway rate for three weeks as I drove my midsize sedan in my typical manner, and then for another three weeks when I exactly matched the speed limits. I calculated that I can save over 11 gallons of gas per year. That's money in my pocket.\Exceeding side street speed limits can also waste gas. It leads to higher rates of braking and acceleration, which only serve to burn more fuel and put more wear-and-tear on your vehicle. No matter what kind of road you're traveling on, avoiding aggressive driving and avoiding accelerating uphill will save you gas. Turning off your engine while parked goes a long way as well, since idling is a sure-fire way to throw gas money down the drain.\Of course, the best way to minimize fuel costs is to drive less. Carpooling, taking public transportation, combining errands into one car trip, or taking your bicycle out for a spin are going to have the most impact. But for those of us who have little choice but to drive our cars, following the speed limit is one of the simplest ways to make a big difference.\Aside from direct gas costs (and the potential for speeding tickets!), higher speeds usually mean more maintenance required for roads and infrastructure and, therefore, more tax money to pay for repairs. Speeding also significantly worsens our air quality.\For every gallon of gasoline burned, 19.6 pounds of carbon dioxide is released. My extra 11 gallons wasted each year through highway speeding alone equates to over 215 pounds of extra CO2 added to the air (which is equivalent to the energy use of the average American house over nearly three days!), not to mention the release of additional pollutants which none of our lungs appreciate. While air quality in Greater Cincinnati is slowly improving, the American Lung Association still ranks us near the bottom 10 percent of cities for year-round particle pollution.\Excessive speeds put our safety at risk, too. Speeding is a factor in over a quarter of fatal crashes in Ohio. Several case studies have shown that municipalities that have lowered their speed limits by 12 to 20 percent saw decreases up to 35 percent in serious injury accidents. Fewer accidents equates to lives saved, and as a bonus, less time-wasting, emission-spewing traffic jams — something we can all live without.\So, the next time you jump in your car, think of that speed limit not as a hindrance, but more as a good friend — one that keeps you safer on the road, keeps the air you breathe cleaner, and keeps your wallet fuller.\Stephanie Heidorn is a stay-at-home parent from Colerain Township, a volunteer at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden, and a graduate student in biology through Miami University's Project Dragonfly.\Your Turn\Stephanie Heidorn\Guest columnist\U.S. Department of Energy says that 50 mph is the most fuel-efficient speed to drive vehicles, so for every 5 mph one drives above 50 mph, it's like paying 19 cents more per gallon, the author says.\Gillis Benedict/Livingston Daily\CREDIT: Stephanie Heidorn"

""We think that there should be a mix of funding options, because for the last three, four, five decades, we've pretty much been relying on the gas tax.""\Bill Cramer\Communications director for the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association\We've probably all thought it at one time or another: I really wish I could pay more for gasoline.\OK, maybe not.\But here's the thing: We might need to.\Ohio's transportation infrastructure – the system of roads and bridges we all use to get around – is in trouble. The state gas tax, one of the primary funding sources for that infrastructure, has been flat since 2005, stuck at 28 cents a gallon.\Highway construction costs are going up, a turnpike bond program is out of money, and vehicles are getting better and better gas mileage. The latter is great for the environment, but it's bad news for a system of roadways that relies heavily on people buying gas.\Presidents Day Sale: Support local journalism for just $1 for the first three months\If nothing changes, the Ohio Department of Transportation is predicting a $156 million shortfall for road and bridge maintenance in 2020.\By 2030, that shortfall would skyrocket to $780 million.\""More crashes will happen. More people will get hurt. And, more people will die,"" said Ohio Department of Transportation Director Jack Marchbanks, testifying during a recent state hearing on infrastructure funding. About one-third of highway deaths can be at least partially attributed to poor road conditions, Marchbanks said.\New Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has made transportation infrastructure funding one of his top priorities, appointing a committee to figure out how to best raise more money. After meeting twice, it seems highly likely that committee will recommend raising the gas tax.\The Ohio Senate president and other lawmakers have already said they're not keen on raising taxes, but what else could the state do?\Here are some ideas:\A few states have experimented with what might be the fairest system of them all: Treat roads like a utility and charge only for the miles traveled.\It's pretty simple, really. Strap a GPS or other tracking device on your car, and, instead of paying a per-gallon tax at the pump, pay a per-mile bill later. In Oregon, the charge was 1.5 cents per mile.\The charge typically applies equally to every vehicle, be it a gas-guzzling SUV or a more- eco-friendly hybrid. But, the fee could be adjusted for trucks or other vehicles known to generate more wear and tear on roadways.\Colorado piloted the idea in 2017, and testers said they felt the system was fair. It hasn't gained much traction for several reasons, though. First of all, tracking mileage with a GPS screams ""Big Brother,"" and not all drivers want to hand over that information to the government, even with privacy protections in place.\Second, environmental advocates worry drivers may be discouraged from buying electric and hybrid vehicles if, regardless of emissions, everyone pays the same per-mile fee.\Third, none of the states piloting the charge has figured out how to capture mileage for out-of-state drivers. It doesn't seem fair to make Ohioans pay for every inch they drive while out-of-staters cruise around with impunity.\We already pay property tax on our houses; what if we did the same for our cars?\That's what happens in Kentucky, where people pay an annual tax based on the value of their vehicles. The state rate is 45 cents for every $100 of vehicle value. There are local vehicle property taxes as well, with those rates set by each local jurisdiction. Together, they raise about $405 million a year.\It could be simple: Drive on this road, pay this toll.\Or it could be an optional express lane. Don't want to sit still during rush hour? Pay a toll, and you can zoom right on home.\Tolls are not exactly known for their popularity, but more and more states are looking to them as one way to bring in extra cash for road maintenance, said Bill Cramer, communications director for the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, which represents toll facility owners and operators.\""We don't go out and say, 'You should toll every road there is,'"" Cramer said. ""We think that there should be a mix of funding options, because for the last three, four, five decades, we've pretty much been relying on the gas tax.""\Any new toll would face plenty of opposition, though. Tolls are complicated and costly to run, said Stephanie Kane, communications director for the Alliance for Toll-Free Interstates. Sometimes, as much as one-third of the revenue a toll brings in is used just for operating costs, Kane said.\She said tolls can slow down first responders, cause wear and tear on secondary roads as people reroute to avoid the fee, and drive up expenses for shipping companies, a burden often passed on to consumers.\Tolls are just ""bad policy,"" Kane said. ""There are so many negative consequences to tolls. The winners, really, are the tolling companies who are operating the toll.""\Roads need repaired because people drive cars on them. The fix-it money comes from the gas tax. But people who drive electric or hybrid cars buy less gas (and thus pay less of that tax).\So, a special fee for such drivers would mean everyone paying his or her fair share.\Sen. Bill Coley, R-Liberty Township, is pitching a similar idea where Ohioans would essentially pay an annual road-maintenance fee in lieu of the gas tax. Drive a hybrid or a regular gas vehicle, it doesn't matter – we'd all pay the same fee.\For those who couldn't afford the upfront fee or who live out-of-state, they could continue to pay the regular gas tax at the pump, Coley said.\""As we encourage more and more people to drive eco-friendly vehicles,"" he said, ""this is a great way to have that happen without penalizing the quality of our roads and bridges.""\The downsides? Again, it might discourage people from buying eco-friendly cars. And, frankly, it's just not enough.\The Ohio Department of Transportation did a rough estimation that shows a $250 annual fee on electric vehicles and a $75-a-year fee on hybrids would bring in about $2.5 million a year. Next to a $156-million-and-climbing deferred-maintenance deficit, that's pretty small change.\God forbid you ever have to fill up your tank in Pennsylvania. The gas tax there is the highest in the nation, 58.7 cents per gallon.\It turns out we have it pretty good in Ohio where the tax has been at 28 cents per gallon since 2005. That might be why DeWine's committee seems so keen on the idea of raising the tax. Perhaps it is time.\Assuming the legislature is on board (and that's a pretty big assumption), one solution is a flat tax increase: Pick a new number, vote it into law, and that's it.\Another solution is a variable increase, one tied to, say, highway construction costs or the price of gasoline. That way, as the market changes – gas prices drop, for example, or construction costs shoot up – the tax would automatically adjust accordingly to still bring in enough revenue.\Want more local reporting like this?

151,"DAYTON -- Democrat Barack Obama on Friday, July 11, delivered some tough medicine to Dayton about how he plans to wean America off its dependence on foreign oil. \His plan calls for doubling the federal fuel efficiency standards within 20 years and investing $150 billion over 10 years in alternative fuels. \Dayton is a victim of high gas prices and a slumping economy: General Motors last month announced plans to close its Moraine sport utility vehicle assembly plant and eliminate its 2,500 jobs. \""If we stay on our current course, the rapid growth of nations like China and India will rise about onethird by 2030. In that same year, Middle Eastern regimes will be sitting on 83 percent of our global oil reserves. Imagine that -- the very source of energy that fuels nearly all of our transportation, controlled almost entirely by some of the world's most unstable and undemocratic governments,"" Obama told 1,300 supporters at Stivers School for the Arts in Dayton. ""This is not the future I want for America. We are not a country that places our fate in the hands of dictators and tyrants -- we are a nation that controls our own destiny. That's who we are. That's who we've always been."" \Rhine McLin, Dayton's mayor and Democratic Convention superdelegate, said ""It's not a quick fix. But I respected this because he had a vision of where he wants to go by 2030 ... How often do you hear elected officials saying there's no quick fix?"" \Republican presidential hopeful John McCain's campaign had a different take: ""Today, Barack Obama criticized wind, hydropower, domestic oil drilling, gas tax relief and nuclear power but did not offer a single proposal to bring down gas prices. The difference is Obama's 'Dr. No' approach believes that every energy source has a problem and John McCain believes that every energy source can be part of the solution Americans need right now."" \Obama and McCain both traveled to Ohio this week, stumping for votes and talking about their plans for energy and the economy. \""When candidates compete for the green vote, the environment, consumers and even business win,"" said Jack Shaner of the Ohio Environmental Council. ""We love this bidding war over who has the best energy plan. Bring it on! At four bucks for a gallon of gasoline, energy and the environment are suddenly pocketbook issues. And any graduate of politics 101 will tell you that pocketbook issues trump all others at the ballot box."" \Both candidates have likened the challenge of gaining energy independence to putting a man on the moon in the 1960s. \Obama promised long-term solutions that would require sacrifice and investment and he criticized McCain's plans as gimmicks, such as a gas tax holiday and offshore drilling, that he said will have no significant impact. \Obama painted McCain as one of the Washington politicians who has done little to curb America's reliance on foreign oil over the past three decades. \""So when John McCain talks about the failure politicians in Washington to do anything about our energy crisis, understand that John McCain should look in the mirror because he has been a part of that failure,"" Obama said. \Obama proposes investing $150 billion over 10 years in alternative energy, $1,000 tax credit for middle income families to help pay for high prices at the pump, a doubling of federal fuel efficiency standards over the next 20 years, and a requirement that 25 percent of America's electricity be generated from renewable resources by 2025. \His plan includes tax credits and loans for automakers to help them make the transition, he said. \McCain's plan calls for a $300 million prize to whoever advances battery technology to achieve a plug-in hybrid car, $2 billion a year in clean coal technology research, and lifting a ban on drilling for oil and natural gas off American coasts. \Both men favor instituting a cap-and-trade credit program to curb greenhouse gases. \Obama discusses DHL situation with Wilmington mayor \Before the town hall event, Obama met with Wilmington Mayor David Raizk and DHL workers who are among the 8,600 likely to lose their jobs when DHL changes package handlers from ABX Air to UPS. \The Ohio congressional delegation is asking the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate whether the proposed change violates federal antitrust laws. \At a town hall meeting in Portsmouth, McCain told a woman if there are antitrust implications, he would support a thorough investigation. He also said retraining programs are important. \""We are in a period of transition to a global economy. That is of no consolation to anyone who is losing their job. That is no consolation. But we have to offer them an opportunity to get the education and retraining programs so they can re-enter the job market,"" McCain said in Portsmouth. \Get the latest national \and local political news \at DaytonDailyNews.com/politics"

Fierce opposition from residents and politicians in Northern Kentucky over tolls has many searching for other options to finance the $2.5 billion Brent Spence Bridge replacement. But tolls are becoming more common around the country as alternative funding sources dwindle, national experts say.
\
A raise in the federal gas tax and a change in how Kentucky allocates federal funds have come up as suggestions at recent public meetings in Northern Kentucky on ways to help pay for the new Interstate 71/75 bridge.
\
But many localities around the country have found themselves having to pay for their own highway projects.
\
A decrease in federal road funds and a climate hostile to earmarks and tax increases in Congress mean the federal government won't pick up the tab like it's done since the 1950s, said David Goldberg, spokesman for Transportation for America, a coalition of national, state and local organizations to reform transportation funding.
\
""It is really hard to get these multistate projects done in an era of scarce resources,"" Goldberg said. ""It is almost inevitable that some larger share will come from state and local taxpayers. It may come in the form of tolls or from some other revenue.""
\
Many states are looking to local taxes for road projects, a USA Today report found. Virginia, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Michigan are considering tolls, higher sales taxes, new taxes on gas stations and higher motor vehicle registration fees to fund transportation projects. Oregon, Washington and Vermont have studied replacing or supplementing the gas tax with a tax based on miles traveled by car.
\
Counties and cities in California in recent years have passed local sales taxes and other taxes to fund large infrastructure projects, said Alison Premo Black, chief economist with the American Road and Transportation Builders Association.
\
No more earmarks; states get lump sum
\
Congress in the past could have just earmarked the $2.4 billion, Goldberg said. Now the federal government gives states a lump sum and allows them to divvy it up as they see fit.
\
""Kentucky and Ohio would have most likely worked to get an earmark for a project of that size,"" Goldberg said. ""They've sworn off earmarks. They may come back, but for now, it is not a feature of the federal bill.""
\
Congress last July, in its Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) budget for federal surface transportation spending, outlined projects of national and regional significance, but authorized only $500 million for the entire country.
\
Some have advocated allocating money spent on foreign aid to the Brent Spence Bridge.
\
The Brent Spence Bridge project competes with both national and local projects. The MAP-21 legislation last year gave Kentucky $1.93 billion in federal funds through 2014. Some Northern Kentucky state lawmakers want to see federal funds doled out based on population.
\
""If we reallocated fuel taxes and federal contributions based on population instead of geography, the money would be there,"" said state Sen. Chris McDaniel, R-Taylor Mill.
\
State lawmakers from other parts of the state, however, disagree. State Rep. Hubert Collins, D-Wittensville, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said the complete widening of the Mountain Parkway in eastern Kentucky is also deserving of federal funds. He said tolls will likely be part of that plan as well.
\
""We need to spread it over the state,"" Collins said. ""With earmarks not being there anymore, the allocation is for the whole state. The two bridges in Louisville are tolled. They worked out a deal with Indiana in Kentucky. I don't see any difference in the Brent Spence Bridge.""
\
And not everyone agrees with the assessment that Northern Kentucky doesn't get its fair share of dollars. Louisville and Lexington also make the same complaint to lawmakers, said state Rep. Rick Rand, D-Bedford, chairman of the House Appropriation and Revenue Committee.
\
""Louisville, Northern Kentucky, Lexington-Fayette County all make the same argument,"" Rand said. ""I think the three metro areas fare pretty well in terms of dollars they get back. When I'm in Louisville, I spend money to go to the movies, restaurants and stores. I don't get to bring that sales tax money back to Trimble County.""
\
Congress hasn't raised the federal gas tax since 1993. The 18.4 cent per gallon gas tax buys 33 percent less than it did in 1993 due to inflation, according to the National Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission.
\
The state gas tax of 29.9 cents a gallon rises and falls annually with the price of gasoline based on a formula and goes into the state road fund. Both pools of money face competition from other projects around the state.
\
The American Road and Transportation Builders Association has advocated a rise in the federal gas tax or any other stable revenue source dedicated toward infrastructure, said Black, the group's chief economist. But she and others say it's a tough sell.
\
""It is a different political environment,"" Black said. ""The recession has not helped matters. You also have the challenge of state and local finances and a lack of political will to increase the gas tax. It is part of a political climate around Congress not wanting to raise taxes.""
\
Lawmakers and residents remain resolute that tolls will do significant economic damage to Northern Kentucky. Many have argued that the situation in Northern Kentucky is the reverse of the two tolled bridges being built in Louisville.
\
There, the majority of the commuters cross the river from Indiana. In Northern Kentucky, most of the residents crossing the Brent Spence Bridge come from Kentucky. During morning rush hour, 63 percent to 65 percent of the local drivers crossing the bridge come from Kentucky, according to a study from the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana Regional Council of Governments.
\
Some hope the findings in a $4 million study commissioned by Ohio and Kentucky to research different financing methods for the bridge will sway Northern Kentucky lawmakers to allow private financing for the bridge project.
\
Waiting to complete the project will only drive up costs, said Mark Policinski, executive director of the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana Regional Council of Governments.
\
""It is so important that we focus on what we need,"" Policinski said.
\
""We need a bridge.
\
""If we need a bridge, why wouldn't you want to build it sooner or cheaper?""

WASHINGTON -- The statistics from the nation's civil engineers are grim: Forty-two percent of Ohio's major roads are in ""poor or mediocre condition,"" 2,462 of the state's bridges are structurally deficient, and the state needs to spend $14.2 billion on its sewer system.
\
But Ohio actually appears to be doing better than the nation as a whole. The deep dysfunction in Washington - where Congress cannot even pass a long-term highway bill anymore - is forcing states including Ohio to devise creative ways to find the money to fix their roads and bridges.
\
""We can't count on the feds to come in and save the day,""' said Chris Runyan of the Ohio Contractors Association.
\
Even though Congress traditionally approves five- or six-year highway bills, Congress last year passed an 18-month highway bill because it couldn't agree on a long-term policy. Congress did so only after extending the 2005 legislation - which expired in 2009 - nine times.
\
The problem isn't as easy as writing a big check - an approach that would likely be met with resistance from a Republican House majority that is loath to spend money during an era of massive debt and deficits. Instead, both Republicans and Democrats agree that the current system of paying for the nation's highways has become nearly obsolete.
\
Federal highway programs are paid for primarily through the highway trust fund, which comes from gas taxes of about 18.4 cents per gallon. The philosophy of that tax is that those who use the highways end up paying for the highways, because they are paying for gas needed to run vehicles. That tax rate has not been raised or lowered since 1993, although Ohio's state gas tax last increased in 2005.
\
The federal gas tax has created three problems, according to Joung Lee, associate director for finance and business development for the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.
\
First, vehicle miles traveled have stagnated over the past five or six years, meaning federal highway officials aren't reaping much more than they were during President Barack Obama's first term.
\
The second problem: alternative fuel. It's been great for the environment, but it has resulted in people buying less gas, which means less in revenue, Lee said. It also means that some users - the ones in the alternative fuel-powered vehicles - pay effectively less than those driving gas guzzlers, even if both drive the same amount.
\
Third: The tax was last raised 20 years ago. The tax, Lee said, ""has lost its purchasing power."" The gas tax, said former Rep. Steve LaTourette, R-Bainbridge Township, generates about $38 billion a year, which the federal government sends to states. ""And everyone knows it takes about twice that a year to keep our roads in good repair,"" he said. ""Forget about building new stuff.""
\
And Congress has been unable to pass a long-term transportation bill. A bill is better than no bill at all, but LaTourette said that state transportation officials need more certainty than an 18-month federal plan can provide.
\
""You just don't wake up one morning saying, 'I'm going to build a bridge,' and go build it,"" he said. ""It takes planning and engineering.""
\
LaTourette said that without a long-term plan, transportation officials will be hindered in planning for the states' future highway and bridge needs. Instead, they will be forced to devote precious dollars to shovel-ready, short-term or reactive projects.
\
The funding problem has spurred some states to take charge of transportation efforts. In Ohio, for example, Transportation Director Jerry Wray jokes that they've done everything ""including raiding the seat cushions for spare change.""
\
But Runyan said that the problem is not just an over-stretched gas tax. The public's expectations of what the federal government should pay for have increased beyond highways to bike lanes, environmental studies and other projects. We are ""living a lifestyle we've become accustomed to,"" he said. ""It's a lifestyle we can't afford.""
\
Ohio is one of many states looking at new mechanisms to pay for infrastructure. Rob Puentes, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program, said in some cases, state and locals are also relying on corporate and philanthropic groups to solve traffic problems.
\
In the west, cities are increasingly asking voters to raise sales taxes to bankroll traffic projects. And states such as Ohio continue to lean on infrastructure banks to pay for their needs.
\
Few however, believe that the gas tax is done.
\
""The gas tax is not going away,"" Puentes said, but highway funding ""is going to look very different in the future.""
\
But whether Congress can agree on a solution is another thing. Puentes said when Congress passed a short-term transportation bill last year, it had a chance to use that time to look at alternatives. So far, Congress has not.
\
""We haven't used that time as well as we should have,"" Puentes said.

Ohio deserves fair funding
\
Ohio motorists' rough rides on the state's aging highways may get a bit smoother in the next few years, thanks to a multibillion-dollar boost from a U.S. Senate committee this past week. While crafting the new six-year highway funding bill, the Environment and Public Works Committee increased Ohio's share by $2.1 billion, to $7.9 billion.
\
But that may not even be the best news: The committee also increased the rate of return Ohio gets on gasoline taxes collected here from 90.5 percent to 95 percent, which should bring an extra $50 million-plus a year - and finally begins to correct a glaring bureaucratic inequity that has made Ohio a gas tax ""donor"" state.
\
Since the federal highway trust fund was set up in 1956, Ohio has gotten back far less than it contributes to the fund through gas taxes - typically 88 cents to 90 cents on the dollar. Meanwhile, states such as nearby New York and Pennsylvania have been raking in $1.21 and $1.17, respectively, for each dollar they contribute.
\
Credit for addressing this inequity belongs largely to Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio. He complained mightily about Ohio's paltry share while he was governor, and hasn't stopped complaining as senator. As he pointed out, Ohio has the nation's fourth-largest interstate network and fifth-largest traffic volume, so a large portion of the nation's goods pass through the Buckeye state. It shouldn't be carrying so much of the load for other states.
\
The full Senate is expected to go along with the plan, and the House is reportedly considering an even bigger boost for Ohio and other ""donor"" states. That's great, as long as they figure out how to pay for it without increasing the federal budget deficit. There's some talk of raising the gas tax rate or indexing it to inflation.
\
Ohio's $2.1 billion boost also depends on pending energy legislation that would correct a nonsensical disincentive against the use of environmentally friendly ethanol in gasoline. To encourage its production, ethanol is taxed at 13 cents a gallon, compared to 18.4 cents a gallon for gasoline. That means the more ethanol a state uses, the proportionately less per gallon it gets back from the highway fund. Ohio uses more ethanol than any state except Illinois and Minnesota, so its ""reward"" is less money.
\
A fix appears likely. With Voinovich's prodding, Congress has begun to see the light on trust fund equity. The rest of Ohio's delegation should keep the pressure on to make sure the state finally gets a fair shake in highway funding.

156,"WASHINGTON -- When it became law in 2009, the massive $787 billion economic stimulus promised to help pull the economy out of its slump by injecting a flood of federal dollars into states struggling to stay afloat. \But two years later, many of the projects are winding down, the economy is still struggling and Congress is in yet another standoff -- this time over how best to pay for future road projects. \""You can plan for the good things, and you can plan for the bad things,"" said John Igel, president of the Columbus-based George J. Igel and Co. Inc. ""But you can't plan for the 'I don't know things.' "" \The uncertainty comes as another massive spending bill divides Congress. The authorization to collect and spend the 18.4 cents a gallon in federal gas tax money on transit and highway projects expires Sept. 30, and leaders in the Republican-controlled House and Democratic-controlled Senate are far apart on a compromise over a surface transportation funding bill. \If no agreement is reached by Sept. 30, or the funding isn't extended, highway and transit projects nationwide could see their funding pulled just as the stimulus pot runs out. \""The 11th hour is here,"" said Matt Jeanneret, a spokesman for the American Road and Transportation Builders Association. \Rod Russell, regional manager of Barrett Paving in Dayton and Cincinnati, said hundreds of local employees are watching the issue with concern. \""This is monumental to our business,"" he said, noting his company's current federal contracts include work on Interstate 75 in Montgomery County. \In addition to road crews, Russell said, the surface transportation funding bill supports trucking, materials, suppliers and sub-contractors. \""Highway work is a local business,"" added Jeff Lamb, Barrett Paving's Midwest vice president. ""The materials don't come from India or anywhere like that. Everything is made in the U.S. and specifically the vast majority of stuff is made in Ohio."" \Work stoppages, furloughs possible \Without a funding extension, Ohio would lose $443 million and an estimated 15,409 jobs, according to Jeanneret. \It would also mean delays in current repairs, increased traffic congestion and additional safety issues, he said. \On a national level, said Jeanneret, it would mean furloughs within the Federal Highway Administration, work stoppages and a halt in planning for the future. \Some fear a partial shutdown akin to what happened at the Federal Aviation Administration. \David Rose, spokesman for the Ohio Department of Transportation, said the department is monitoring the debate in Washington. If there is a decrease in federal funding, he said, ODOT could keep some of the major projects going, but only for a short period of time. \""All of those would be in jeapordy,"" said Chris Runyan, president of the Ohio Contractors Association. He said the state could likely coast with its own funds for one or two weeks, but ""that time would be spent gradually shutting down over that period of time."" \Donald Spang of the Miami Valley Regional Planning Commission in Dayton said the federal government spent $224.5 million on highway and transit projects in the region in 2010. \Without that funding, thousands of Dayton-area jobs are on the line, he said. \""Everywhere you drive, you see construction going on,"" said Spang. ""Most of those projects are federally funded."" \No more stimulus \For all its controversy, the stimulus bill provided a shot in the arm to the construction industry. All told, the bill poured $27.5 billion into the nation's transportation system, paving roads, rebuilding bridges and improving interchanges. \Among the most ambitious Ohio projects it supported: $133 million for the Nelsonville bypass on U.S. 33 and $79.5 million for the I-90 Innerbelt Bridge in Cleveland. \In the Miami Valley, the stimulus helped resurface I-675 in Greene County, widen Byers Road in Montgomery County, fund part of the Ohio 4 bypass construction in Butler County, and provide streetscape improvements in Springfield. \Downtown Dayton got new curbs and several streets resurfaced as part of the so-called Gateway Improvement Project. U.S. 35 in Greene County was resurfaced from the Montgomery County/Greene County line to the U.S. 35/ I-675 interchange. And the ""continuous flow intersection"" at Austin Pike got a stimulus boost. \In all, stimulus money paid for $774 million in Ohio Department of Transportation projects and $161.5 million in projects sponsored by localities. ODOT says 173 of the 220 projects it handled are now complete. \Runyan said the bill stemmed a hemorrhaging in the construction industry, turning an expected 40 to 50 percent reduction in the workforce into a 20 to 25 percent reduction. \But the jobs, he said, were primarily short-term. ""It was a welcomed investment in transportation infrastructure,"" he said. ""But it wasn't the panacea originally sold to many people...there is not anything for these people to move to next."" \Spang said just five of the 42 local projects funded through the stimulus are still under construction. \Prior to the stimulus bill, ""a lot of our members were putting resurfacing projects in mothballs,"" he said in its defense. ""We weren't doing it because we didn't have the money to do it. We were able to fill in a lot of the gaps with stimulus funds."" \But U.S. Rep. Bob Gibbs, R-Lakeville, said too little of the stimulus -- 3.5 percent, according to the American Road and Transportation Builders Association -- was spent on roads and bridges. \""In general, we've got a mountain of additional debt, and I don't think we got much out of it,"" Gibbs said. ""Unemployment is still 9 percent or higher. I don't think it worked."" \11 days left \Supporters say time is running out on reaching a compromise on the next batch of highway funding. \Congress is in recess, and will have 11 legislative days in September before the Sept. 30, according to Jeanneret. \The federal government traditionally spends about $41 billion a year on the nation's highways -- only about one-fourth of the roughly $160 billion total spent on highways, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Federal highway dollars traditionally come from the federal gas tax and other revenue directed to the Highway Trust Fund, but Congress has traditionally spent more on highways than the revenue in the fund, borrowing from general revenues to pay for projects. \House Transportation Committee Chairman John Mica, R-Fla., says that has to change. He and other House Republicans are pushing a six-year, $230 billion bill that would reduce transportation funding by about a third, relying only on funds generated by the gas tax. Gibbs, a member of the committee, said the House proposal better reflects the fiscal reality. \""The pie is smaller,"" he said, saying that it is likely states will be given block grants and asked to make the decisions about what to fund. ""My advice would be to prioritize."" \The Senate alternative, meanwhile, would authorize $109 billion over two years and maintain existing spending levels. Sen. Barbara Boxer, chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said the cuts proposed in the House plan would ""throw hundreds of thousands of people out of work in a sector that has suffered enormously during the recession."" She said the investment has ""not kept up with the needs."" \Spang called the looming battle ""scary."" \""I've been in this area doing this for 34 years,"" he said. ""And I've never experienced going this long without a reauthorization of the surface transportation act. It just doesn't look like anyone's willing to bite the bullet and reauthorize it."" \Staff Writer Josh Sweigart contributed to this report.\Credit: By Jessica Wehrman Washington Bureau"

And, it's been difficult to find the estimated $2.5 billion to build a new bridge next to it to increase capacity.\On Tuesday, the last day to file new bills, Republican Rep.

The bill doesn't explicitly state that it's for the bridge, but advocates for the bridge project have suggested using gas tax funds instead of tolls.\Right now, Kentucky's gas tax is 26 cents per gallon. Santoro's bill instead sets a base rate of about 34 cents per gallon. That rate would be adjusted annually, according to the 74-page bill. By comparison, Ohio's is about 38 cents.\There are also changes to heavy equipment motor carriers taxes, electric vehicle fees, registration fees, license fees, special license plate fees, and more.\It's unclear how much new revenue the bill would bring in. Santoro, who represents part of Boone County did not respond to The Enquirer's calls or emails.\The bill would establish a multimodal transportation fund that would, among other things, ""provide assistance to transit programs in the state by helping offset the loss of toll credits,"" the bill read. That could be a veiled reference to the decades-long battle to fund the Brent Spence Bridge project.\That's been stalled, in part, by Kentucky lawmakers refusing to use tolls to pay for the local match of the project. They've said a toll would disproportionately hurt Northern Kentucky residents who use the bridge daily while major industries use it to transport goods across the U.S.\In 2016, former Gov.

The chemical compound of the plant changes depending on when it gets harvested, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.\Moser's legislation would exclude certain cannabinoid products from the marijuana definition, establish labeling requirements for cannabinoid products and create the Kentucky Center for Cannabis Research at the University of Kentucky. Human cremation\It can be weird to think about.\But Democrat Rep.

163,"Ross Perot has come a long way from the start of his first presidential campaign. At that point, the main proposal associated with him was a 50-cents-a-gallon increase in the federal gas tax. This time he proposes that the federal government should not be allowed to raise taxes unless it holds a national referendum on the issue.\That referendum proposal was in his acceptance speech when the party he created nominated him for president. The heart of the speech was a list of statistics indicating how terrible the federal budget deficit will get - mainly in the third decade of the next century - and how awful the national trade deficit is.\The speech didn't have much in the way of specific proposals for dealing with these problems. In the realm of trade, Mr. Perot put himself forth as a better `horse trader' than the other guys. (He declared himself for `free trade' but against `stupid trade,' whatever that means.)\In the realm of the budget, he claimed to have demonstrated that he is more efficient than the two main parties.\He has, at least, denounced the Dole tax plan, calling it a demonstration of the worst in Washington.\If Mr. Perot doesn't want to call for a tax increase right now, that's defensible. Taxes are high, after all, and satisfaction with government is not. But to outline how the government deficit is on a disastrous course, and then to propose tying the govern- ment's hands in dealing with the problem is pretty strange.\Still, there are ideas in Mr. Perot's acceptance speech that are worth pausing over. He proposes gradually turning Social Security into a pension fund, so its pending debts are always covered by funds on hand. Under the current system, the experts are agreed that the fund is solvent for a matter of decades, because more is coming in through Social Security taxes than is going out in payments. That will continue to be the case for a long time. Eventually, however, that will become terribly difficult to sustain, because a larger percentage of people will be retired and a smaller percentage will be working. Something has to give.\Mr. Perot has thoughts to express on other subjects, too. He believes academic education should start earlier than first grade, because brains are taking their permanent shape earlier. And he referred his party members to books that he is associated with on the subjects of the government health-care programs and the `dollar crisis.'\If there is a pattern to what he is saying, it is that he wants to focus on long-term issues that have overarching importance. Nowhere in his speeches or appearances or documents do you get much input on such near-term controversies as welfare, affirmative action, gun control or abortion.\Meanwhile, some long-term concerns are missing, too, such as the quality of the environment.\The notion that the world needs Mr. Perot to get its attention focused on long-term issues is dubious. If Washington is so oblivious to the long term, why is the Social Security system solvent for decades into the future?\Unquestionably, a lot of 21st-century issues remain unaddressed. But addressing them is easy. The hard part is solving them. It's a lot harder than electing a supposedly efficient horse trader.\In this election, Mr. Perot can get some attention focused where it might not otherwise focus. Perhaps the best thing he could do would be to tell both political parties that they shouldn't be talking about tax cuts. He can help keep attention focused on the fact that, even though the deficit is coming down, long-term projections don't look good."
164,"As Congress finalizes funding issues in the $200 billion transportation bill, groups in the slower lanes - bicyclists, joggers and hikers - are lobbying to keep their share of the pie.\There is a lot at stake locally. The topography of the Miami Valley benefitted with a network of trails and bikepaths after 1990, the last major transportation legislation, when national trail advocates siphoned off $450 million.\The non-highway lobby hopes to do even better this year, although they have plenty of competition for the money.\David Burwell, president of the national Rails to Trails Conservancy, calls his group, affectionately, the ""coalition of all losers.""\The 1990 legislation, which went by the blunderbuss title of the Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act, became the federal blueprint for spending the billions raised by\the government's 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax.\""In the first ISTEA we got a very big piece of the highway gas tax,"" said Burwell, whose group seeks to create a web of trails for biking, hiking and horseback riding throughout the country. ""Legislators started realizing that these are really popular programs with people.""\Both the House and the Senate are considering new, six-year highway and mass transit bills. They are close on spending levels, with the House seeking $217 billion and the Senate $214 billion. Both represent a big jump in funding levels. Differences between the two bills are currently being worked out in a joint House-Senate committee. Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., the chairman of the Senate environment and public works committee, hopes to have a bill on President Clinton's desk by the end of this month.\Burwell said both versions contain increased funding for non-highway projects. He is pushing Congress to keep that money in the final version of the bill and urging that some states - like Ohio - be more aggressive in funding trail projects. Under the new ISTEA legislation, funding for non-highway projects could jump from $450 million to $650 million nationally, according to Burwell. States, however, could shift 50 percent of the $200 million increase to highway projects.\In the past eight years, the Miami Valley has received its share the non-highway federal funds, explaining in part why the number of trails in the area is steadily growing. Since 1993, the area has received $7.4 million in funds for trails, bikeways and other related projects, according to Jamie Mooney of the Miami Valley Regional Bicycle Council.\Not all projects rely on federal funding. Many groups in the area have been very aggressive at raising local funds.\""I'd like to think that some of the success we've seen is due to events like our ThunderRoad Bike-A-Thon,"" Mooney said.\Charles ""Ed"" Dressler in Greene County has been active in pushing projects as well, such as the seven-acre Xenia Station, part of a planned series of trails that will eventually allow cyclists to ride from Dayton to Xenia or Cincinnati - or Cleveland sometime in the not-too-distant future.\Xenia Station will have its grand opening on May 23, with a number of activities, including a 5K fun run, according to Mooney.\The Washington-based Rails to Trails, which seeks to land-bank former railroad right-of-ways, has completed more than 303 miles in Ohio to date. One major project is the Ohio River to Lake Erie trail, which will travel from Cincinnati and link up with the local H-connector before moving on to Columbus and eventually Cleveland. An eight-mile section of the trans-state trail, from Xenia to Cedarville, is expected to open this year, according to Burwell.\With last year's completion of the Creekside Trail in Greene County and the Mad River Bikeway extension to Eastwood MetroPark, only the H Connector, linking Eastwood to Creekside, remains to complete the loop between Dayton and Xenia. The H Connector, which is being built by Five River MetroParks, is scheduled for completion in 1999.\Five River MetroParks is paving the 13-mile Wolf Creek trail that runs from Trotwood to Verona. That should be completed by late June.\A segment that runs from Huffman Dam to Wright-Pat will also be completed by MetroParks this summer.\The only bicycle-related project in this area that has no current source of money behind it is a bike-pedestrian bridge over Ohio 444, according to Mooney.\Burwell said the Ohio Department of Transportation could do more for local projects.\""Ohio's six-year apportionment of ISTEA 1 money is $86 million and of that they have spent only $56 million,"" Burwell said. ""They have left local projects twisting in the wind.""\Others disagree.\""I would say Ohio is a leader in this,"" said Don Spang of the Miami Valley Regional Planning Commission. ""It takes time to develop projects like these. Certainly this area is a national role model in bikeway planning.""\dale_dempsey@coxohio.com"

A NEW report looking at funding of highway maintenance, commissioned by the United States Chamber of Commerce, makes some salient points, and some of its recommendations deserve consideration. However, it also offers up one very stupid idea: taxing hybrid and fuel-efficient vehicles through a special fee. That's an insult to Americans who are helping to ease, in their own personal way, this nation's dependence on foreign oil.
\
It's a ridiculous notion, not just because of its underlying logic that cars with better gas mileage pay less in gas tax, and therefore should be taxed in some other fashion, but because it would penalize Americans who make an environmentally prudent purchase.
\
Many hybrid purchasers understand that gasoline prices would have to climb substantially higher than they are now - and stay there - to offset the higher up-front purchase price. But they buy the vehicles anyway because at 50 miles to the gallon or more, they help the environment. Why should that spirit of good citizenship be punished?
\
This isn't a make-or-break revenue source for highway spending, of course. Hybrids are only a tiny portion of the auto market. Even so, Toyota reckons 100 million gallons of gas have been saved by its hybrid vehicles in this country since the introduction of the Prius in 1997.
\
It's the proposal's message that is so unpalatable. Instead of encouraging the purchase of vehicles with good gas mileage, it tells owners there's a price to pay for their environmentally sound choice - and it comes in the form of a tax bill.
\
That proposal should be parked, permanently, so that attention can be focused on both the background to the chamber's report and its other recommendations.
\
The report concludes that the federal Highway Trust Fund will see insufficient receipts over the six years of the recently signed highway and public transit act, and its highway portion will have a zero balance by 2008.
\
As if that were not enough bad news, it also says that revenues from all levels of government will fall $500 billion below what's needed for highway maintenance through 2015 and $1.1 trillion under what's required for improvements.
\
The chamber is going in the right direction in recommending that the federal gas tax be indexed to inflation. It has been set at 18.4 cents a gallon for the last dozen years, with 15.44 cents of it going to highways, and inflation has eroded receipts.
\
It's the only major tax not inflation-adjusted, but a House committee recommendation last year for an increase of 4 or 5 cents was shot down by the Bush Administration, so that doesn't bode well for any suggestion of index-linking. Nor do we see much future in a switch to a mileage-based system of charges in place of the fuel tax, also noted in the report.
\
The funding of highway maintenance and improvements is itself in need of repair. It's disappointing that the chamber should divert attention from its legitimate concerns by the silly idea of taxing hybrids.

Environmentalists are reeling from the Obama administration's decision to give conditional approval for Shell Gulf of Mexico Inc. to drill for oil and gas in the Arctic Ocean.
\
With memories of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf still fresh, it's hard to see why a green light was given to Shell in the Chukchi Sea. Since it was initially granted permission to operate in the Arctic in 2012, Shell has had drilling setbacks in one of the world's most environmentally fragile regions.
\
After two of its oil rigs ran aground and had to be towed, the Interior Department rescinded Shell's drilling permit. The agency criticized the company's failure to adequately supervise contractors and Shell was forced to acknowledge that it was initially unprepared to deal with an environment defined by extreme weather and remoteness.
\
That should have disqualified Shell from future Arctic drilling, but Obama is giving it another chance, provided it passes a final set of permit reviews. Environmentalists don't share the administration's optimism and many fear another mishap. It's not as if, in 2015, the United States is starved for oil.
\
This president has had a strong environmental record, but if a drilling disaster occurs in the Arctic, it will be known as Obama's folly -- and deservedly so.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
\
Congress is -- again -- planning to pass a temporary extension for the Highway Trust Fund, which uses the federal gas tax to pay for road, bridge and public transit construction. But the fund is nearly broke. Last year, lawmakers adopted a 10-month extension so they would have time to develop a longer-term funding plan. But with the May 31 deadline approaching and no deal in sight, members are expected to pass a two-month patch.
\
This is Congress at its most frustrating. There is widespread public support for repairing and upgrading the nation's infrastructure, and there have been bipartisan proposals to help close the funding gap by gradually increasing the gasoline tax, which hasn't been raised since 1993. Federal officials have documented the backlog of deferred maintenance -- more than half of the nation's major roads are rated poor or mediocre and one-quarter of the bridges are structurally deficient. Yet lawmakers repeatedly passed stopgap measures rather than address the underlying problem, which is that the fund doesn't generate enough money to pay for the essential transportation investments needed.
\
The Highway Trust Fund was designed to be a self-sufficient, user-supported fund. Users of the roads would pay gas taxes at the pump that would finance transportation infrastructure. But lawmakers have refused to increase the gas tax to keep up with inflation. That inaction, coupled with the growing fuel efficiency of the nation's vehicle fleet, has whittled away the buying power of the fund over many years. The gasoline tax currently generates about $35 billion a year, but the federal government spends more than $50 billion on highway and transit projects. Congress has had to transfer money from the general fund to cover the shortfall.
\
The most rational step is to increase the gas tax and set future increases to the rate of inflation. However, Republican leaders, President Obama and many Democrats have flatly refused to do it. Instead, they've proposed tapping various fees and funding schemes unrelated to transportation. If members of Congress and the Obama administration don't want to raise the gas tax, then they should be hard at work developing an alternative source of reliable transportation funding. This extension should be the last. It's time to fix the Highway Trust Fund.

Regarding the Associated Press article ""Highway fund could go broke in August"" (June 3): I agree completely with Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, who said Congress must raise the federal gas tax, now 18.4 cents per gallon. May I suggest we use a sliding scale for awhile (two years) and pay a $4 flat-rate per gallon for this precious petroleum? (Perhaps exclude truckers?)
\
We will keep our infrastructure firm, flesh out other lapses in funding, increase the likelihood that people will actually buy new cars that get better gas mileage and help our environment.
\
Let's focus this tax on people who drive cars and SUVs. If we all make a sacrifice together, we may help our state through this difficult time.

Two news stations stated on June 1 that Dr. George Tiller had performed more than 10,000 abortions. Are there really that many cases where the mother's life is in jeopardy or the infant has been identified as having multiple birth defects? If there really are that many high-risk scenarios, wouldn't they best be performed in a hospital setting with insurance companies having signed off on their legitimacy?

Aren't former Vice President Dick Cheney and many in the GOP having it both ways? They take credit for keeping us safe from terrorists for seven years. During this same stretch of time, the gravity of unabated illegal immigration was a constant chorus from the same folk. These are two inseparable issues. A jihadist entering the United States is an illegal immigrant. If the borders are porous, how can Mr. Cheney be so sure?

\
the GOP.
\
washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.
\
A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.
\
The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.
\
The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.
\
The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.
\
The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.
\
Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.
\
Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs.

Democrats to blame for high gas prices
\
U.S. Rep. John Boehner's guest column (""Republicans can bring lower energy costs America deserves,"" May 24) on energy costs was right on the money. In 1995 only Bill Clinton stood between us and the vast oil fields in Alaska. One complaint was that it would be 10 years before we saw any of that oil. Well, it's been 13 years, gas is $4 a gallon and the Democrats somehow blame Republicans for high prices.
\
The cartoon on the opposing page makes no sense whatsoever. Perhaps reprinting it with Clinton (either one), Nancy Pelosi and Reid would hit the mark.

Gas tax holiday would not help at all
\
I can't believe Rep. John Boehner is again promoting the gas tax holiday (""Republicans can bring America lower energy costs,"" May 24). Even Sens. John McCain and Hillary Clinton have pretty much dropped this thoroughly discredited notion. No sooner would the measly 18 cents a gallon be taken off the price of a gallon of gas than the price would jump right back up to the level that balances demand with tight summer supplies of gasoline. The 18 cents, instead of building and repairing bridges and roads, would go to the refiners and oil producers. Drivers would be no better off, but you can bet politicians would try to convince you that the price would have been even higher if they hadn't ""saved"" us from the gas tax. Boehner must think we are neither well-informed nor educable.

Repeal levy because of illicit ad
\
Regarding the news brief ""Election ad results in fine"" (May 28): A business owner in Fairfield places an expensive ad in the Northwest Press encouraging voters to pass the Northwest Schools levy (where levies had been voted down for several years), under the guise it was paid for by the Area Business Supporting Good Schools.
\
The last I checked, Fairfield is in Butler County. Those of us who feel cheated since this levy was passed by two votes would like it repealed based on fraudulent acts such as this. I think this businessman owes all of us, who will now pay an extra $116 annually for a poorly financially run district, a bit more than the $5,600 fine he's been given.

Big Brother has gone too far
\
In response to the ""Your Voice"" column ""Winning the food fight against Big Brother"" (May 27), welcome to the world of the modern-day smoker. It was simply a matter of time before Big Brother decided that he could make all of our decisions for us. Since the public are obviously so simple-minded that we can no longer make sound choices, Big Brother must do it for us.

'Bodies' more like morgue case
\
This is in response to the Community Conversation item ""Debate over 'Bodies' rages on"" (May 27), when a reader compared ""Bodies ... The Exhibition"" exhibit to Mapplethorpe. Please. Mapplethorpe was about nudity. ""Bodies"" is about the international black market for bodies and body parts. It actually has more in common with the Hamilton County morgue photography scandal. Unfortunately for that photographer, he had no money, no power and no influence with the local press. Fortunately for the deceased, they had family members to speak for them.
\
The folks appearing in the exhibit are from very far away, and their families likely have no idea what happened to them. Would freely donated bodies not be quite as educational?

172,"I saw our country's historic commitment to infrastructure and its impact on our economy during a recent 332-mile bike ride from Pittsburgh to Washington, D.C., via the Great Allegheny Passage (GAP) rail trail and the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O) canal tow path trail.\The C&O canal provided transportation for goods and people and spurred economic development westward along the Potomac River. The GAP railroad supported the coal and steel industries in Pittsburgh and the Ohio Valley.\The C&O canal and GAP railroad were built during the 19th century when our country's leaders worked together for the common good of our nation. Engineers used their expertise to meet technical challenges such as the Paw Paw Tunnel on the C&O canal; it was an engineering feat that is still in place today. All along the C&O and GAP trails were evidence of economic opportunities and prosperity generated by this infrastructure.\As technology developed, this infrastructure was replaced by interstate highways, more efficient railroads, airports, and other transportation systems in the 20th century.\To be successful in the 21st century we must maintain and upgrade our infrastructure.\American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) 2017 Infrastructure Report Card (www.infrastructurereportcard.org) gives our nation's current infrastructure an overall grade of D-plus. The Report Card evaluated 16 categories including roads, bridges, dams, and inland waterways. Data was collected for each of these categories to assess their condition, and capacity to meet current and future needs.\The grade for America's roads was a D. Approximately 40 percent of our urban interstates are congested; associated traffic delays cost the country $160 billion in wasted time and fuel. One out of every five miles of highway pavement is in poor condition.\The overall grade for our nation's 614,387 bridges was a C-plus. Almost 40 percent of our bridges are 50 years old or older and approximately 9.1 percent, or 56,007, bridges were structurally deficient in 2016. Many of the nation's bridges are approaching the end of their design life. Our bridges are in need of $123 billion of rehabilitation.\In Ohio, almost 2,000 bridges are rated structurally deficient and 17 percent of roads are rated in poor condition. The average Ohio motorist spends $475 a year on their vehicles fixing damaged incurred on poor roads. The Brent Spence Bridge is a clear example of the issue; it is functionally obsolete and motorists using it consistently experience long delays.\The Report Card shows that the condition of our infrastructure impacts our economy and quality of life. Poor roads and airports increase travel times and costs and reduce productivity. Inadequate water and wastewater treatment systems have negative impacts on our environment and health.\The United States is on track to invest only half of what is needed for our infrastructure over the next decade. This under investment will result in a loss of 2.5 million jobs and $3.9 trillion in GDP by 2025. American households will lose $3,400 each year in disposable income due to infrastructure deficiencies.\Our challenges are solvable and can be met through investment, leadership, and a forward looking approach.\Fixing our nation's infrastructure requires sustained and dedicated investment from all levels of government and the private sector. We should spend between 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent of GDP on infrastructure by 2025. This should begin with fixing the Highway Trust Fund by raising the federal motor fuel tax to restore its purchasing power. State and local governments must also do their part; twenty-three states have increased their gas tax in the past 5 years. Ohio's gas tax has not been increased since 2005. Increasing the gas tax and improving infrastructure will help Ohio businesses by enhancing their ability to manufacture and distribute goods and provide services.\Leaders at all levels of government, business, and our communities need to work together to plan, prioritize, and fund needed infrastructure projects.\We must look to the future and utilize new approaches, materials, and ideas such as autonomous vehicles, distributed power generation and storage, larger ships, and emerging technologies.\ASCE and our nation's engineers are ready to design and build the future.\Our political leaders need to step up to the challenge and take bipartisan action on infrastructure for our country, businesses, and families to succeed.\Tony Klimek lives in West Chester Township and is a practicing engineer and treasurer of the American Society of Civil Engineers Cincinnati Section.\Tony Klimek"

City has been replacing lead pipes for 60 years
\
To set the record straight, Cincinnati Water Works has been replacing lead water service pipes for more than 60 years. They have not been allowed in the Cincinnati water system since the late 1920s.
\
The lead pipes are replaced from the water main to the property line with copper pipe.
\
State law dictates that Water Works revenue can only be used to maintain, operate and improve the public water system.
\
That part of the water line from the property line into the house is private property and is the responsibility of the property owner.
\
It would be illegal for Water Works to spend public dollars on private property. It would also expose Water Works and thus the city to extreme liability for any damage done to the private property.
\
Thousands of home owners have already borne the expense of replacing the portion of the water line that they own. The Water Works should not expect them to participate in the cost of replacing water lines owned by others through increased water rates.

Raising gas tax temporarily a good idea
\
The gentlemen from Delhi (""Now is the time to raise the gas tax"") who suggested we raise the gas tax may have just hit on something. I do not usually agree with raising taxes, but in this case an additional tax for a limited amount of time makes sense.
\
I would be in favor of raising the tax on gasoline and diesel to fund major capital road projects such as bridges, not potholes. The tax would need to have a renew date that requires a vote, so as not to be in place forever.
\
For the potholes and other maintenance, these costs need to be embedded in the base tax in such a way that the amount collected has no bearing on the price of oil. Maintenance is related to miles driven, not gasoline prices.
\
The base tax should fluctuate based on inflation rates - remember, taxman, fluctuate means go both up and down. I am certainly not an economic expert, but I have taken my savings due to the low gas prices and made one-time home improvements. Feds and states should do the same.

Enquirer's portrayal
\
of crime is unfair
\
A more appropriate and fair way to portray crimes in communities would be to contrast crimes committed to size and population of the neighborhood involved. It is important to recognize that the misleading statistics, as presented, influence people's property values, perceptions of neighborhoods and their safety, the effectiveness of their schools and each neighborhood's ability to obtain community investment.
\
The Enquirer's portrait of crime in our city lacks good analysis or reflection and inadvertently picks winners versus losers.

Candidates comparable
\
to WWE pro wrestlers
\
If WWE pro wrestling were to transform into a political institution it would mirror the presidential debates. Each candidate, from both sides of the political spectrum, is as close to representing an everyday American as Andre the Giant and Hulk Hogan are.
\
Believe me, I care just as much as the next person about the state of our great nation. But we get tricked into thinking the candidates are more informed about the problems our communities face than we are and somehow convince ourselves that we should credit them when the economy is doing well and condemn them when it isn't. Let's give ourselves some credit, as well as some blame.
\
We shouldn't need permission from this president or the next one to fix our nation's problems. But nevertheless, I'll fall into a deep hypnosis watching the next debate looking for someone else to fix the problems that were left over by a president who was voted into office four years earlier under the exact same context.
\
Every once in awhile I'll flip through the channels and stumble upon WWE pro wrestling and for some odd reason proceed to watch it. I know it's fake. But the pointless slander and jibber jabber trick me into thinking, just for a moment, that it really matters who wins.

174,"After three straight legislative session working with – and sometimes fighting with – former Gov. Matt Bevin, the Republican supermajority of the Kentucky General Assembly will now labor over an extremely tight budget with a Democratic governor wielding the final pen.\The 2020 legislative session of the Kentucky General Assembly kicks off today, the fourth consecutive session with Republicans holding over 60% of the seats in each chamber.\What's new this year is the occupant in the Governor's Mansion: Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear is set to present a two-year budget proposal to the legislature in late January, along with an ideological agenda that runs counter to that of his predecessor, Bevin.\What remains constant in this 60-day session is the extremely tight nature of the biennial budget. While only modest revenue growth is projected in the coming years, obligations to cover public pensions, Medicaid and other costs will sharply increase.\Beshear wants to find common ground and civility amid disagreement with the Republican-dominated legislature, but that will be put to the test as he attempts to make good on campaign promises of increased spending for education with new sources of tax revenue.\Talk has been civil between Beshear and Republican leadership in the legislature since the November election, but Republican Senate President Robert Stivers maintains that the governor's main plan for new tax revenue – legalizing casinos – has no chance in that chamber.\Stivers has told The Courier Journal that while his Republican colleagues aren't opposed to increasing teachers' salaries and funding for K-12 and postsecondary education, money will be hard to find in this budget, and promises made during elections ""sometimes can't be fulfilled by the realities of the environment and the economics of that environment.""\Three weeks after Bevin conceded defeat, his administration's budget director laid a grim document at the feet of the new governor's transition team: a memo estimating a $1.1 billion state budget shortfall over the next two fiscal years.\Though the Beshear administration and the nonpartisan Legislative Research Commission haven't yet signed off on the accuracy of those estimates, Jason Bailey –the executive director of the progressive Kentucky Center for Economic Policy – has conceded that the coming two-year budget will be ""a real train wreck"" and require the most cuts over the past decade if significant new tax revenue isn't created.\State economists have projected revenue to increase by $146 million and $207 million in the next two fiscal years, but this is expected to be quickly eaten up by the rising costs of shoring up the state pension systems, expanded Medicaid, payments for state employees' health insurance and housing the state's 24,000 prison inmates.\On the pension front, the largest plan for state workers is set to have its employer contribution rate increase from 83% to 93% next year.\Kentucky's portion of covering the expanded Medicaid population will increase from 8.5% to the maximum of 10% in 2021 and 2022, which is expected to increase costs by nearly $50 million next year.\According to the Kentucky Association of School Boards, the unfunded mandate of the school safety bill passed in the 2019 session will cost $121 million annually to implement, requiring new resource officers and counselors to be hired.\Additional funds that may have to be identified include a loan of $50 million to assist the University of Louisville's acquisition of Jewish Hospital and $23 million annually to lease, staff and operate a privately owned prison in Floyd County.\Adding to these known costs are the projected costs of several Beshear campaign promises to increase spending on public education – the exact figures of which won't be known until Beshear presents his budget proposal.\However, the memo from Bevin's budget director last month stated that Beshear's pledge to raise public K-12 teachers' salaries by $2,000 each would cost $97 million annually, while increasing funding for postsecondary education and the K-12 per-student SEEK amount by 1% would add an additional $42 million annually. Increasing funding for the Teachers' Retirement System above the required contribution was listed as costing an additional $110 million per year.\The last two-year budget continued to slash funding for most agencies to make way for a dramatic increase in pension contributions. The number of state employees has fallen by about 30% over the past decade as agencies work with less money.\Just how deep the cuts are in the next two-year budget, and how many of the aforementioned budget priorities get funded, depends largely on how much new tax revenue is created by the legislature – if any.\Beshear campaigned on funding most of his new education spending through new tax revenue generated by legalizing casinos through a constitutional amendment. With much of that tax revenue directed toward pensions, Beshear said it would free up $550 million annually for spending on public education, though others have estimated the figure could be as low as $175 million and take years before such revenue is realized.\But if that doesn't happen, as Stivers predicted, the new governor would have to look elsewhere for new revenue.\One of those places may stem from a bill by Rep. Adam Koenig, R-Erlanger, to legalize sports betting in Kentucky. It passed unanimously out of a House committee in 2019 but never made it to a vote on the floor.\Koenig has prefiled a similar bill this year to allow Kentuckians to legally bet on sports, online poker and fantasy sports contests, with one study estimating it would create anywhere from $20 million to $48 million annually in revenue from new taxes, registration fees and licensing fees. He says he is ""extremely optimistic"" his bill will pass the House this year. In the Senate, Stivers says he is ""ambivalent"" to sports wagering.\Advocacy groups for city and county local governments are also looking to Frankfort for budget relief through new methods of revenue, hoping state government provides them with new taxing authorities.\The Kentucky League of Cities and Kentucky Association of Counties is making a renewed push for a constitutional amendment to allow a local option sales tax, in which voters via referendum could approve a 1% sales tax increase with revenue directed to a specific project.\Faced with increased pension obligations and corrections costs, medium and large cities will also push for legislation to raise their restaurant tax, which could create an additional $31 million annually for Louisville Metro Government.\A 50-cent tax increase on packs of cigarettes in 2018 has generated over $100 million in tax revenue, and legislators may return to that well this year. A bill prefiled by Rep. Jerry Miller, R-Louisville, would also add an excise tax on the sale of e-cigarettes, which is estimated to raise $35 million a year in new revenue.\The Kentucky Chamber of Commerce and local governments have also endorsed modernizing the revenue model for the Kentucky Road Fund, supporting a bill that would include raising the state gas tax by 10 cents per gallon, imposing new fees on electric vehicles, and raising existing annual fees on all vehicles.\While this proposal would direct more road funding to local governments, it also faces stiff opposition from conservative groups like Americans for Prosperity-Kentucky, which argues that current funding is sufficient and mismanaged by the Transportation Cabinet.\In addition to new tax revenue, there is always a chance the Republican-dominated legislature will pass additional tax cuts that decrease revenue, such as the 2019 bill that cut taxes for banks by $105 million.\While many Republicans still favor new public funding for charter schools and legislation creating tax credits for those who donate to private K-12 scholarship funds, such conservative education policies now have an active opponent in the new governor.\The scholarship tax credit bill may still show signs of life, but its advancement may also reawaken teacher protests that have swept through Frankfort in the past two sessions.\Proposals to increase spending on public schools, expand kindergarten and pre-K, increase teacher salaries and fund the 2019 student safety bill are likely to fill much of the budget and revenue debate.\Education groups may also throw their weight behind efforts to curb the rising use of e-cigarettes among teens, with Miller prefiling a bill to reduce youth access to flavored e-cigarettes and a bill from Rep. Buddy Wheatley, D-Covington, seeking to ban the sale of flavored vape products entirely.\Rep. David Hale, R-Wellington, also prefiled a bill to ban transgender students from using restrooms that align with their gender identities, which he says could save non-transgender students from ""potential embarrassment, shame and psychological injury."" Past bills instituting such a ban have failed in the General Assembly, and North Carolina, the only state to pass such a law, has since repealed it.\Rep. Jason Nemes, R-Louisville, has once again prefiled his bill to legalize and regulate medical marijuana in Kentucky. The bill received a House committee vote for the first time in 2019, passing nearly unanimously.\But it never came to a vote on the House floor, despite nearly half of the chamber's members co-sponsoring it. Nemes is optimistic the House will pass it this year – although the Senate appears more skeptical.\Also in the House, Rep. Cluster Howard, D-Jackson, has gone a step further to prefile a bill legalizing and taxing recreational marijuana, which he estimates could create up to $800 million of annual revenue.\Howard's bill would decriminalize the possession of less than 1 ounce of marijuana and allow those previously convicted of a marijuana-related misdemeanors to have their offense expunged for free. Permits to grow cannabis plants at home also could be purchased for $250 per year under the bill, which faces long odds for passage.\Four Republican members of the House from the Louisville region have prefiled a resolution asking the Beshear administration and a Louisville pollution agency to examine doing away with the federally mandated use of reformulated gasoline in the city and parts of Oldham and Bullitt counties.\If the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approves such a request, as happened recently in Northern Kentucky, the legislators claim it could save motorists $73 million annually at the pumps at no cost to the environment.\As LG&E moves forward with its controversial plan to build a natural gas pipeline through a section of Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest, Rep. Jim Gooch, R-Providence, has prefiled a bill to crack down on civil disobedience protests to block natural gas pipelines.\Gooch's bill would make ""tampering with, impeding, or inhibiting operations of a key infrastructure asset"" of such a pipeline a felony, in addition to making the employer of such a protester civilly liable. As of last summer, seven states had already passed a similar law.\The 2020 regular session of the Kentucky General Assembly will kick off on Tuesday, Jan. 7.\Michael Reaves/Special to Courier Journal\CREDIT: Joe Sonka"
175,"NEWARK - The speed limits on some Ohio roads could vary from day-to-day or hour-to-hour and the shoulder of the road could become a driving lane to help manage congestion during peak hours.\Ohio Department of Transportation District 5 Deputy Director Sonja Simpson told the Licking County Commissioners on Tuesday of the state's ideas to keep traffic moving safely and reduce congestion. Gov. John Kasich has proposed giving ODOT the authority to use the new concepts.\The state may combine the two new concepts -- using the shoulder as a driving lane and reducing the speed limit by 10 miles per hour during peak travel times. Use of the shoulder for driving may be tested on a stretch of Interstate 670 in Columbus, she said.\""If it's successful there, it may be realistic to try elsewhere,"" Simpson said. ""We have to think our way out of congestion and not just build our way out.""\ODOT must determine it the shoulder is wide enough everywhere, and make sure the lane is free of debris like tires, or dead deer, Simpson said.\The variable speed limit is currently only allowed for school zones and work zones. In Europe, crashes decreased by 30 percent since variable speed limits were implemented, according to ODOT. A digital speed limit sign could be changed at any time, based on traffic congestion, accidents or adverse weather conditions.\""Our goal is safety, and a part of safety is ensuring traffic moves in a manner allowing people to get where they want to go at a safe speed,"" Simpson said.\The most likely place to test the variable speed limit will be in northeast Ohio, where lake-effect snow or fog can suddenly make driving treacherous, especially in urban areas.\Simpson said it's too early to know if the speed limit on Ohio 16/37 should be increased since the Cherry Valley interchange opened, eliminating traffic backups at the former Ohio 16-Cherry Valley Road intersection.\""There are a lot of variables on speed limits,"" Simpson said. ""You can create a problem if you make it faster. It's something, maybe, to look at."" Granville village and township officials said in December that ODOT informed them of the study of a possible closure of River Road access to Ohio 16, due to safety concerns. There are no acceleration/deceleration lanes to ease exit and entry to the westbound portion of the state route.\""A lot of people are talking about it,"" Simpson said. ""People have mentioned it as a desire (to close it), and others said, 'don't ever close that.' "" Simpson said the ODOT focus is on maintaining the current infrastructure rather than building new roads. Commissioner Tim Bubb said more money is needed for roads and bridges, but discussion of increasing the gas tax is a forbidden topic.\""The future of infrastructure and the maintenance of infrastructure is really the future of the county,"" Bubb said. ""It's so hard to pull it out of the political environment. It's so hard to have a real conversation."" Commissioner Duane Flowers said, ""I'm in favor of a mileage tax, not a gas tax."""

Ohio senator says he will fight for $50M to fix Brent Spence
\
WASHINGTON - When a conference committee writes a final version of the $284 billion transportation spending bill now working its way through Congress, only one person from Ohio or Kentucky is likely to be in the room.
\
And that person, U.S. Sen. George Voinovich, said Wednesday he plans to fight for at least $50 million to complete the design and environmental review of a Brent Spence Bridge replacement over the next five years.
\
The Ohio Republican's strategy is simple. Once the designs are done for a new bridge, it would again be time for Congress to pass another massive transportation spending bill - and the two states would be in position to get the bulk of the estimated $750 million needed to build it.
\
""A lot of this will have to do with the willingness of my colleagues on the House side to look at other projects that they have and understand the importance that this bridge has,"" Voinovich said. ""But the main thing right now is that (Ohio and Kentucky officials) need to have the money to move with speed in terms of preparation to get this up and on its legs.""
\
Voinovich expects to be on the conference committee because he is a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. He also was on a conference committee that failed to settle on a final version of the same bill last fall.
\
The senator and other members of the regional congressional delegation met Wednesday with a group of about 50 representatives from the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce, who visited the capital to push for funding to replace the nearly 42-year-old bridge and lobby for other issues. The chamber and its counterpart in Northern Kentucky have asked for $82 million over the next five to six years for the bridge.
\
Business and elected officials from throughout the region have been pressing for a replacement for the bridge for years. Opened in late 1963, the Brent Spence carries Interstates 71/75 across the Ohio River and now is a major traffic chokepoint. It's considered functionally obsolete due to its narrow lanes, poor signage and complicated merges.
\
Wednesday, the Senate Environment and Public Works committee passed its version of the multi-year highway bill that funds major projects such as the bridge. It called for $284 billion over the next five years, matching the amount authorized in the version that passed the full House last week.
\
The Senate bill names no specific projects, unlike the House version, which includes $2 million specifically for the Brent Spence.
\
That mention was inserted at the last minute by U.S. Rep. Geoff Davis, R-Hebron, whose district includes the bridge. His original allocation of $14 million was dedicated to other local projects. All Republicans last week were given an additional $2 million, which his office put toward the bridge.
\
""That's the important thing - to get it mentioned by name,"" Davis said. ""We're very excited about the momentum we have and are pretty optimistic about what could happen in conference,"" when differences between the House and Senate bill are resolved.
\
Amount could grow
\
As the transportation bill goes through the Senate, there's new talk that the amount could grow from $284 billion. But that could lead to a reprise of last year's showdown with the White House. That showdown killed the bill.
\
""We are very hopeful that this does not turn into another argument with the Senate over the funding level,"" Transportation Undersecretary for Policy Jeffrey Shane told the chamber group Wednesday. ""I am not unsympathetic to the argument that we need more ... but this is the most difficult budgetary environment I've ever seen, and this is more than an adequate number.""
\
Ohio state highway officials have said that construction on any new bridge would probably have to wait until completion of a major renovation of I-75 from the river to I-275, a process expected to take at least seven years.
\
Cincinnati chamber president Michael Fisher said before his group returned to Cincinnati that he was ""very encouraged by the congressional support and that (undersecretary) Shane expressed support for the project.""
\
Meanwhile, Voinovich said that if the Senate debate continues about the bill's total amount - which he argues is not enough to meet the country's infrastructure needs - a possible hike in the federal excise tax needs to be considered.
\
Shane said the administration wants no part of a possible gas tax increase.

Increasing the gas tax and improving infrastructure will help Ohio businesses by enhancing their ability to manufacture and distribute goods and provide services. \Tony Klimek is a practicing \engineer in Cincinnati, \and one of our regular \contributors.\Credit: By Tony Klimek"
178,"MOUNT HOPE — Economic development and infrastructure go hand-in-hand, especially in Holmes County, where development is limited by infrastructure. \That’s according to Holmes County Economic Development Council Executive Director Mark Leininger, who recently welcomed a group of local leaders and business representatives to the annual meeting of the council. \To those, he said, the ability to be successful hinges on the ability to improve the infrastructure. It’s a theory that recently became a reality when local, state and federal funding totaling nearly $450,000 was combined to improve roadways in Walnut Creek Township. \The project was prompted by the construction of a new 300,000-square-foot manufacturing facility along County Road 140, between Walnut Creek and Sugarcreek, by ProVia. \The $10 million project supports relocation of Heritage Stone, purchased by ProVia in 2011, to Holmes County from Muskingum County, according to a prior agreement with the Holmes County commissioners. \The purpose of the road project is to improve local transportation infrastructure to safely accommodate increased heavy truck traffic and other local traffic, according to Leininger, who said ProVia has made a significant contribution to the infrastructure by footing the $600,000 bill to extend more than a mile the public sewer lines to the new building. \Expansion of the facility means increased heavy truck traffic on County Road 140 and Township Road 420, which previously were traveled by automobiles, farm equipment, bicycles and horse-drawn buggies. \Keynote speaker at the annual breakfast meeting was Congressman Bob Gibbs, a Lakeville Republican, who currently is seeking his fourth term in the U.S. House of Representatives. \“The entrepreneurial spirit is great in Holmes County,” Gibbs said, noting that it is bolstered locally by a healthy banking structure, which goes hand-in-hand with business success. \He spoke largely about the federal budgeting process — distinguishing between what is mandatory and what is discretionary spending. \“Because revenues are not increasing at the same rate (as spending), it makes less money available for discretionary spending,” said Gibbs, noting with discretionary spending is funding for defense and infrastructure. \With mandatory spending projected to flatline, with the exception of health care, which is on the rise, he said, available funds for discretionary spending will be less. Consequently, Gibbs said, “Mandatory spending must be addressed. That’s really what drives the problem.” \Tax reform is necessary if companies in the United States are to compete in a global market, he said, noting the regulatory side “gets in the way of job growth.” Gibbs said he supports “common sense: reforms at the federal level. \With more available funding, he said, the federal government can continue to build on the infrastructure initiatives already in place. \Efforts have been made to improve ground, rail and water transportation, all critical in the effort to move products and be competitive in the world market, he said, noting the United States has started to fall behind other countries in the area of infrastructure. \To move forward, he said, the country needs to address a growing debt, which will lead to a debt crisis and “will make the 1930s look like child’s play,” said Gibbs, adding the United States can get on the right track by instituting the right policies. \Questioned by Holmes County Engineer Chris Young about a long-term funding solution to make infrastructure sustainable for the future, Gibbs said he doesn’t think anyone in the legislature is looking at it, although he admits the gas tax is no longer a sustainable option, thanks to the advent of more fuel-efficient vehicles. \One solution, he said, could be hinged on miles driven, but “I don’t think society is ready to go there because of the fear of Big Brother,” said Gibbs, adding, “It has to be a national discussion.” \It’s a discussion that can only happen if the nation is able to carve its way out of a deep economic hole, freeing up funding for infrastructure and national defense, both the responsibility of government. \“We need to create an environment where American people can chase their dreams. When the economy is doing well, the environment is enhanced. When it is not doing well, the environment suffers,” he said. “We have to put more money into the military and national defense. We also have to address the infrastructure. \Reporter Christine Pratt can be reached at 330-674-5676 or cpratt@the-daily-record.com. \CREDIT: CHRISTINE L PRATT "

THE North American International Auto Show, one of the global auto industry's most prominent annual celebrations of itself, is under way in Detroit. The industry has ample reason to feel festive these days: New-vehicle sales in the United States set a record in 2015 -about 17.5 million cars and trucks, surpassing the previous top performance in 2000. Many analysts predict the industry will do even better in 2016.
\
This year, the Detroit show is featuring high-dollar luxury vehicles as well as new and redesigned crossovers. Automakers' preparations for the self-driving cars of the not-so-distant future also are getting plenty of attention. But amid the good cheer, there is cause for concern about other industry trends.
\
As gasoline prices have declined- a reflection of plummeting global oil prices- American consumers again are embracing sport utility vehicles, light trucks, and crossovers, and are relatively disdaining small and midsized cars.
\
If that becomes a long-term trend, it's good news for brands such as Jeep; its Cherokee and Wrangler SUVs, built at the Toledo Assembly Complex, set model sales records last year. (At the Detroit show on Monday, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles CEO Sergio Marchionne confirmed that the company will shift production of the Cherokee elsewhere but will keep the Wrangler in Toledo and add a Wrangler-based pickup here.)
\
But overall vehicle fuel efficiency, which had improved substantially since the Great Recession began, is falling again. That development is limited by stronger federal fuel-economy rules, which automakers to their credit have signed onto, yet it is still worrisome.
\
At the same time, automakers, both domestic and international, are moving production of increasingly unprofitable small cars from the United States to Mexico. These developments are troubling for the American economy and for the environment, as growing fuel consumption by larger vehicles threatens to aggravate human-made climate change.
\
Relying on lighter-weight manufacturing materials and other advanced clean-car technologies can help automakers promote fuel efficiency. But such innovations cannot permit backsliding on other aspects of fuel economy.
\
Auto executives insist that they are building the products their customers want, and that the dictates of the market should be allowed to prevail. They note that they aren't responsible for changes in gas prices. They assert, correctly, that the industry's recovery since the depths of the recession is a testament to its resilience and focus on the future.
\
But they didn't do it all by themselves. During the recession, the federal government - read: taxpayers - bailed out General Motors and Chrysler (which includes Jeep), enabling the companies to emerge quickly from managed bankruptcies and preventing the domestic supply chain from collapsing. The government also provided loan guarantees to help keep the industry solvent.
\
The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates low, promoting car and truck sales. These policies have especially benefited auto states, notably Ohio and Michigan.
\
While gasoline prices remain low, this would be an ideal time for Congress and President Obama to raise the federal gas tax of 18.4 cents per gallon, which has stayed the same for 23 years. Such an increase not only would discourage wasteful fuel consumption, it also would provide badly needed new revenue for highway repair and other infrastructure maintenance.
\
The ability to use the gas tax to these good ends will diminish in future years, as production of electric and other alternative-powered vehicles increases. But President Obama is a lame duck, and lawmakers are preoccupied with getting re-elected above all other concerns. So there is little prospect for action in Washington this year.
\
By all means, let's enjoy the Detroit auto show. But when the celebration is over, the auto industry's long-term reckoning will need to resume.

WOOSTER -- Given the state of the state budget, Wayne County residents should not expect any new major infrastructure projects coming out of the Ohio Department of Transportation District 3 office, rather a heavy emphasis on maintaining and preserving existing state roads.
\
Even so, District 3 Deputy Director Allen Biehl announced nearly $12 million in resurfacing, bridge and culvert projects this construction season within the county during a presentation Monday at the Wayne County Administration Building. There also are other projects in which Wayne County is included either through districtwide or local jobs.
\
Tim Farley, highway management administrator for District 3, gave an overview of the county projects.
\
Making up more than half of the amount are two big-ticket resurfacing projects: $4.1 million to improve U.S. Route 30 from Kansas Road to the Stark County line and $3.1 million for U.S. Route 250 between state Route 83 and Kidron Road.
\
The sole local-let project for this season is a $1.8 million reconstruction project of state Route 585/Akron Road between Gateway Drive and Old Airport Road, which Wooster will do in conjunction with ODOT, city Engineer Joel Montgomery said.
\
As the city builds new roads, it wants to include bike paths, Montgomery said, and he hopes ODOT will agree to put them in on this project. Ultimately, he would like to see Wooster connect with Orrville through bike paths or lanes.
\
Districtwide projects include reactive maintenance work along Interstate 71, which will include Wayne, Ashland and Richland counties. A microsurfacing project along state Route 83 from state Route 302 to the Holmes County line is scheduled to begin toward the end of July.
\
Wayne County Engineer Roger Terrill talked about some of the county projects anticipated this year, which includes bridge and box culvert replacements, like one on Sterling Road between Friendsville and Canaan Center roads.
\
Like other governmental entities feeling the constraints of lower revenue and increasing costs, Terrill indictated fewer projects are able to be completed because of how costs have skyrocketed since 2003.
\
Biehl said the recently passed transportation budget of $5.6 billion will help create an environment for job creation and help spur economic development.
\
However, there seems to be some bumps on the path to recovery.
\
""Slowly and surely we seem to be coming out of the recession,"" but the recovery could be affected by gas prices, which rose to $4.15 recently, Biehl said. The high gas prices mean people drive less, which leads to fewer gallons of gas purchased, resulting in lower gas tax revenue for transportation projects. The tax is paid based on the gallon, not dollar, amount.
\
Inflation also is hindering how many projects ODOT can do because, ""it costs 50 percent more to do (a project) today than it cost seven years ago,"" he said.
\
Placing a further strain on limited funding is an abundance of projects approved by the Transportation Review Advisory Council, a nine-member panel authorized by state law to guide the selection process and to approve major ODOT projects, said Ken Wright, administrator of planning and programs at ODOT District 3. The group did not say ""no"" to enough projects, Wright said, though it did scrap a high-speed rail project.
\
""We don't have money for new infrastructure,"" Biehl said, so ODOT will direct its resources primarily to maintaining and preserving the infrastructure in place. But, not all major projects will be killed, he said, but the number of them will be ""dialed back."" He also noted raising the gas tax is ""not in the cards.""
\
Presently, federal dollars that come into Ohio require a 20 percent local match. ODOT would like to see the local match drop to 10 percent, Biehl said. Discussions at the federal level have included thoughts of raising the local match to 30 percent. Biehl said he recently spoke with Congressman Jim Renacci (R-Wadsworth) about the issue.
\
""The cuts at the federal level have me concerned, and we will keep our eye on funding shifts handed down from D.C.,"" said Jeff Griffin, president of the Wooster Area Chamber of Commerce. ""The Chamber has consistently advocated for ODOT dollars to Wayne County. We are fortunate that our local officials have made good use of the funds and have great relations with ODOT. Obviously, our infrastructure is essential to job retention and growth.""

181,"WASHINGTON -- Something strange has been happening to taxes in Republican-dominated states: They are going up. \Conservative lawmakers in Kansas, South Carolina and Tennessee have agreed to significant tax increases in recent weeks to meet demands for more revenue. They are challenging what has become an almost dogmatic belief for their party, and sharply diverging from President Donald Trump as he pushes for what his administration has billed as the largest tax cut in at least a generation. \And now some Republicans say that what has played out in these states should serve as a cautionary tale in Washington, where their party's leaders are confronting a set of circumstances that looks strikingly similar. \Republicans, with control of Congress and the White House and a base that is growing impatient for tax reform, are trying to solve a difficult math problem: paying for critical programs like infrastructure, health care and education while honoring their promise to deliver lower taxes without exploding the deficit. \The debate promises to test the enduring relevance of one of the most fundamental principles of modern conservatism: supply side economics, the idea that if you cut taxes far enough, the economy will expand to the point that it generates new tax revenue. \With the federal deficit growing and economic growth sputtering along in the low single digits, the Republican Party is facing questions from within over what many see as a blind faith in the theory that deep tax cuts are the shot of economic adrenaline a languid economy needs. \""Tax cuts -- good. And that's about as much thinking that goes into it,"" said Chris Buskirk, a radio host and publisher of American Greatness, a conservative online journal. \Now, he said, Republicans in Washington seem to be in an arms race to the lowest rates possible. \""Everybody is trying to overbid each other,"" Bus-kirk said. ""How much more can we cut?"" \Outside Washington, Republicans are discovering there are limits. \In South Carolina, Republicans overrode their governor's veto and blocked a filibuster to increase the gas tax. They also rejected a series of broader tax cuts on the grounds that they were too expensive and voted instead to create a smaller tax incentive for low-income families. \The Republican governor of Tennessee, Bill Haslam, signed into law the first increase in the state's gas tax in almost three decades. \He defied conservative groups that said a state with a $1.1 billion budget surplus had no business asking people to hand over more of their money. \And in the most striking rebuke of conservative tax policy in recent memory, Republicans in Kansas have undone much of the tax overhaul that Gov. Sam Brown-back held up as a model for other states and the federal government to emulate. \""A fantastic way to go,"" he said this year, urging Trump and Congress to follow suit with deep reductions to corporate and individual rates. But Republican lawmakers in Kansas decided that they could cut only so much without doing irreparable harm to vital services and voted to increase taxes by $1.2 billion last month. Brownback vetoed the plan, but Republicans in the legislature overrode him. \The situation in Kansas was, for at least some conservatives, a jolting realization that tax cuts can be too blunt an economic instrument. \After Brownback took office in 2011, he pursued a plan that included cuts and, in some cases, an outright elimination of taxes for businesses and individuals to help invigorate the state's underperforming economy. \He described it as ""an experiment"" in conservative governance that could demonstrate what Republicans were capable of if they controlled legislative and executive branches across the country. \The conservative movement got behind him. The plan was approved with the lobbying muscle of the billionaire Koch brothers' political network, which is overseen from Wichita, where one of the brothers, Charles G. Koch lives. \It had the blessing of prominent conservative economists like Stephen Moore and Arthur Laffer, the Republican Party's foremost supply-side evangelist. \In urging the Kansas Legislature to act, Laffer and Moore said the cuts would have a ""near immediate"" positive impact on the economy. Brownback said the plan would pay for itself. \That is where the parallels with Washington start to trouble those who are critical of the plan the Trump administration has laid out. The plan would slash the rate paid by businesses to 15 percent and shrink the number of individual income tax brackets from 7 to 3 -- 10, 25 and 35 percent. \Laffer and Moore, a Heritage Foundation economist, have both helped shape the president's tax policy. \Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said the Trump tax cuts would pay for themselves with the economic growth they would inevitably create. \But in Kansas, the predicted economic bloom did not materialize. Employment and economic growth have lagged far behind the rest of the nation. \The state Treasury had so little money to spread around that the Kansas Supreme Court found that the state's spending on public education was unconstitutionally low. \In a world in which Trump's ""deconstruction of the administrative state"" reduces the size and cost of the government, the tax cuts make sense. \But if lawmakers do not have the nerve to find savings somewhere, like in the social safety net for retirees, the outcome could end up resembling something close to Kansas' failed experiment. \""The question is whether you can put together some kind of revenue-neutral tax reform,"" said N. Gregory Mankiw, a professor of economics at Harvard and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush. \""I don't see the political will to do that right now. Certainly not in this environment.""\Credit: Jeremy W. Peters, (c)2017 New York Times"
182,"For anti-sprawl advocates like Gene Krebs, the news that the Ohio Department of Transportation will begin falling short of revenues for construction projects in 2009 is both a crisis and an opportunity. \With gas prices rising, oil production peaking and the highway construction industry facing double-digit inflation, Krebs and his land-use reform group Greater Ohio are hoping ODOT officials will begin to recognize there are more ways than just highways to move people and freight around. \""ODOT needs to get away from the highway department mentality and get into a people-moving mentality,"" he said. ""We're going to have to look at streetcars in the city and high-speed rail between major metropolitan areas."" \ODOT's 2008-09 Business Plan, released last week, shows the agency faces a $114 million shortfall beginning in 2009 that could climb to $3.5 billion by 2015, with major construction projects losing half of their needed funding by that year. \Oil price increases are mostly to blame. Gas tax revenues, which account for the bulk of ODOT's funding, have flattened as motorists drive less and switch to higher mileage vehicles. Meanwhile, highway and bridge construction costs have climbed 41 percent in four years, thanks to higher energy costs and competition with India and China for building materials. \The shortfall already has led to political wrangling in Columbus. Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland's administration blames the previous Republican administration for not adjusting ODOT's budget for inflation, over-committing to major new projects and stripping as much as $1 billion from future budgets for repairs and maintenance. \But Republican Speaker of the House Jon Husted, R-Kettering, said the Republicans in the House had a plan to solve the problem for the next budget biennium, but it was rejected by the Democrats. \None of this is comforting for local government officials and citizens who are counting on major road improvements over the next decade. \""Obviously, we have some serious concerns,"" said Donald Spang, executive director of the Miami Valley Regional Planning Commission. \The $670 million modernization of Dayton's Interstate 75 corridor is under way, with Phase I set to eliminate Malfunction Junction. But Phases II and III -- which will add an extra lane in both directions through the region and improve downtown ramps -- are considered new projects and may be in jeopardy, according to Spang. \Spang said a big reason Dayton-area voters supported the state's 6-cents-a-gallon gas tax increase in 2004 was the promise that Interstate 75 would be improved. ""There is a dramatic need for that corridor to be modernized,"" he said. ""It's handling 125,000 vehicles a day when it was designed for only 60,000."" \ODOT officials say they have committed to all repair and maintenance projects, but have put on hold any new major road projects until those already funded have begun construction. Funding for current projects is guaranteed for the next two years, but many projects are spread out much longer, some to 2015. \ODOT spokesman Scott Varner said the agency will soon organize a statewide task force of citizen groups, government officials and industry representatives to set priorities for new construction projects and to look at longterm solutions to the shortfall, including ""new and innovative ways of financing"" Ohio's transportation needs. \Those options could include creating toll roads and charging developers more of the costs associated with access to and increased traffic around new businesses, he said. \But Krebs believes ODOT has been backed into a tax revenue corner. Truckers and motorists will avoid toll roads by using other routes. Another tax generator -- hiking registration fees on new vehicles -- will lead many Ohio residents to register their cars through family and friends living in neighboring states. \Simply raising the gasoline tax will create even more incentives for motorists to curtail driving and purchase higher mileage vehicles -- a demand that the auto industry is poised to meet, Krebs said. On the cost side, ODOT will face increasing competition for oil and building materials from rapidly developing countries like China, India, Malaysia and Singapore, adding to inflationary pressures on prices, Krebs said. \""It's a perfect storm"" for a continuing budget crisis for ODOT, Krebs said. \ODOT's top managers say they're committed to exploring alternatives to new highway construction, including rails, urban transit and waterways. The 42-page Business Plan calls for ""a new commitment to a multi-modal approach to modernizing the state's transportation system"" and ""a sensitivity to the environment,"" including a requirement that all new construction projects be evaluated for their land-use impact before they can be funded. \Andrew Bremer, executive director of the rail passenger advocacy group All Aboard Ohio, said his talks with Strickland administration officials have assured him they are serious about ""all different forms of transportation."" \But changing long-ingrained attitudes among ODOT's civil servants may be difficult, Krebs said. And before Ohio can divert from its endless highway expansion, suburban sprawl and big-box retail construction, many agencies will have to change, not just ODOT, Krebs said. \The Ohio Public Works Commission will have to stop funding water and sewer lines in unincorporated areas. The Department of Development will have to revise its Job Ready Sites requirement of a minimum of 200 acres for development. The Ohio School Facilities Commission will have to encourage construction of new buildings in densely populated areas rather than busing students to the outskirts of town. \""It will take a completely integrated approach"" to land use and transportation planning, Krebs said. \But Bremer fears the biggest obstacle to change is the same one facing new highway construction -- lack of money. ""We are dismayed that there may be a shortage of funds down the line to implement these multi-modal packages."" \Contact this reporter at (937) 225-2437 or jdebrosse@DaytonDaily News.com."

Punishment, compassion both needed
\
I want to thank Blade ombudsman Jack Lessenberry for addressing the issue of ""sympathizing"" with accused drunken driver Michael Gagnon. I, like everyone else, was horrified that such a senseless loss of lives had occurred. I haven't been able to stop thinking about the victims and their surviving family and friends. I can't begin to imagine the pain they are in, and my heart breaks for them.
\
However, I think that Mr. Lessenberry hit the nail on the head. By reading about the pain this has caused the Gagnon family, people can truly understand how many lives this accident has touched and the irreversible damage it has done to everyone. Regardless of how people feel about Mr. Gagnon or his family, I hope they will always remember the repercussions of this accident and think twice about the choices they make.
\
Furthermore, I don't believe that Mr. Gagnon is a monster who woke up that day and decided to kill five people. He made a terrible choice, and he will pay dearly for it. His family also will suffer because he is their son, brother, grandson, etc., and they love him unconditionally. Imagine how his parents must feel, knowing that their son is responsible for such a horrible accident and that his life is basically over. I'm sure they will replay the events of that night over and over in their heads for the rest of their lives.
\
I, too, want Mr. Gagnon punished, but I think people need to find it in their hearts to have compassion for him and his family. ""Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ, God forgave you (Ephesians 4:32).""

Justice is doubtful in fatal I-280 crash
\
Will Michael Gagnon, the 24-year-old who was legally drunk times three, really receive a just punishment for crashing his pickup into a van, resulting in the death of five people on I-280? If recent history is any indication, one may doubt it.
\
Just a few short years ago, a drunk driver caused an accident on State Rt. 2 in Ottawa County that resulted in the death of six people from Michigan who were on their way home from Cedar Point. That driver served less than three years for his crime.
\
The residents and elected officials of Lucas County need to be sure the justice system does not duplicate the unjust punishment that is all too frequent in drunk-driving accidents.
\
It is time to put away the politics and plea bargaining.

Driver knows pain caused by accident
\
What Michael Gagnon did is indeed a tragedy and I am not trying to justify it. But in response to a Jan. 16 letter in the Readers' Forum that states he needs to witness the pain and suffering of the family, good grief. Is the writer so cold that she thinks this young man doesn't already know the pain he has inflicted?
\
Has she thought about Mr. Gagnon's family and what they are going through?
\
Enough is enough. My heart goes out to both families.
\
I am sure that the knowledge that he has killed so many people is far worse than any punishment the state of Ohio could ever give him. As for the letter writer, how wonderful it must be to be so perfect. God forbid that she ever make an error in judgment and turn into the wrong lane, run a red light, or pull out in front of somebody because she didn't look or was talking on her cell phone while driving.

Essays ensure right of all to live in peace
\
Having read Rob Vincent's July 7 and Dec. 22 essays regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I was dismayed by the Dec. 29 letter in the Readers' Forum describing these essays as promoting ""ethnic cleansing."" Since when does majority rule mean ""ethnic cleansing""? Was majority rule for South Africa ethnic cleansing? This makes no sense.
\
Far from being weak historically, Mr. Vincent gave an in-depth historical overview that supported his position. I did not come away with the sense that he wanted to force anybody to move anywhere. Instead, he seemed to bend over backwards to ensure that the people of the region - both Arab and Jew - can stay where they live now, in peace.

U.S. must become a nation of savers
\
I have read countless stories about the presidential candidates, learning how each person would solve the problems of our nation. I have seen stories about the economy, war, education, the environment, religion, and various other topics. To a lesser extent, I have seen information about our national debt. This is the issue that each of us should be very concerned about.
\
Each child born in the United States owes about $35,000 to the federal government. In short, we are quickly becoming a nation of debtors. Imagine if, instead of giving newborn babies fluffy bears or cute dolls, we handed them IOUs for $35,000 or, worse yet, demanded payment from their parents.
\
The United States was built upon wealth creation and saving for the future. Our present society, to a large extent, is built upon spending and spending and spending. We must demand of our candidates that each one commit to balancing the budget each and every year. We have to do it in our homes, our cities, and our states. We must learn to do more with less. We must become a nation of savers.

'Made in U.S.A.' now a rare label in stores
\
A recent letter in The Blade's Readers' Forum about products ""Made in U.S.A."" struck a chord with me. At age 79, I've been a passionately patriotic American since childhood. In 1994, I enacted my own boycott of products not made in America. I had accompanied my daughter and her two young daughters to a store for the annual children's photos to be sent out in Christmas cards. While they waited their turn, I idly walked up and down the aisles, glancing at the displays and noting the products' country of origin. What I found was that most were not made in the United States.
\
That was the beginning of my personal boycott. I was determined to purchase new shoes made in the United States. It took two years to find shoes not made in China (and even then they were made in another foreign country). I still check the labels and feel a sense of triumph when I find the (sadly) rare label, ""Made in U.S.A.""

Middle-aged people need chance to work
\
As a divorced woman in her 40s and a single parent, it doesn't seem to me that employers treat us equally in job interviews. Why is this? We are trainable and very dependable. Although our previous work experience may not be exactly what is wanted, why not give us a break and try us out before judging us?
\
I've tried every avenue that's available in Toledo to get a job. Recently, I was at a business in Maumee that ran an ad that claimed it was ""hiring on the spot,"" which it wasn't. And, since I didn't have the ""exact"" experience, I was turned away without being considered.

MAYORAL ELECTION 2005
\
WHO WILL LEAD CINCINNATI
\
They are single, young and have famous fathers, but Mark Mallory and David Pepper have different priorities as they campaign for mayor
\
On Nov. 8, Cincinnati voters will elect a new mayor, the second under the ""stronger mayor"" system. Their choices: City Councilman David Pepper or State Sen. Mark Mallory.
\
The two candidates are both young, single, and ambitious, the sons of famous fathers: Procter & Gamble Chairman John E. Pepper Jr. and former Ohio House Minority Leader William L. Mallory Sr., a legend in the Statehouse.
\
After graduating from Yale University, Pepper worked at a Washington think tank and later landed an economic development job in St. Petersburg, Russia.
\
He returned to Yale to get a law degree and now works at Squire, Sanders & Dempsey, a Cincinnati law firm. He ran for city council in 2001 and in 2003, finishing first both times.
\
Mallory went to the University of Cincinnati, and then spent 14 years working for the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, starting as a shelver and moving into administration. He won a state House seat in 1994 and his state Senate seat in 1998; he is now the assistant minority leader, the No. 2 Democrat.
\
They've both represented the city in legislative bodies. Now they are running for the top job in the city.
\
But what are their records?

COLUMBUS - During his decade in the Statehouse, first as a member of the Ohio House and now as a state senator, Mark Mallory has fought for better prison conditions, more drug and alcohol treatment, and tougher lemon laws.

But his top achievement, he says, was fixing a long-forgotten, century-old mistake.

In 2003, Mallory convinced the General Assembly to re-ratify the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

The Ohio General Assembly originally ratified the amendment that gave freed slaves citizenship in 1867, but a newly elected Democratic-controlled legislature rescinded the ratification in 1868.
\
""I think that's the one I'm most proud of because it took a lot of work,"" Mallory said. ""That was the highlight of my legislative career.""
\
Mallory said hate groups and militia groups could have used Ohio's inaction as a way to challenge the 14th Amendment nationwide, saying it was never properly a part of the U.S. Constitution.
\
""It established due process. It established citizenship. The 14th Amendment is a huge amendment as far as the impact it has on people,"" Mallory said.
\
Mallory, 43, is described - by Democrats and Republicans - as quiet and effective. He never rocks the boat, but he gets the job done in his 9th District seat, according to legislators on both sides of the aisle. The district includes most of Cincinnati, Norwood and St. Bernard.
\
Karen F. Dudley, past community council president of the College Hill Forum, credited Mallory with helping revive her neighborhood.
\
""Senator Mallory was a big help to us in College Hill,"" Dudley said last week. Dudley said several major businesses, including Kroger, vacated the intersection of Hamilton Avenue and North Bend Road two years ago. ""We found ourselves with three vacant corners,"" she said. Dudley said Mallory helped get financial support from National City Bank to complete a $40,000 market feasibility study at the site. Now, developers are hoping to break ground in the spring for offices, shops and housing.
\
Stefanie Sunderland, co-chair of the Coalition against the Colerain Connector, praised Mallory for helping defeat a proposed state highway project in her Northside neighborhood, ending a more than 40-year battle.
\
Sunderland said that every four years Ohio Department of Transportation planners would cart out drawings and try to rejuvenate the project. But Mallory, as a member of the House and while running for the Senate, worked to kill the project altogether in the 1990s. His intervention, she said, helped get the state-seized land transferred back to the city for park and future economic development. ""Mallory went to bat for Northside,"" Sunderland said last week. ""The community was getting worn down. We had always been able to postpone it but never able to defeat it.""
\
In Columbus, Mallory has a reputation for being intelligent, gentlemanly - and always showing up. In fact, he's one of a handful of state lawmakers who never missed a session. Mallory only missed one vote on a minor Senate resolution and was excused for two others involving pay raises and the appointment of his father to the Ohio Elections Commission. ""When I say I've never missed a vote, I always say I've never missed a vote on a bill and I've never missed a vote on an amendment. I've never missed a session,"" Mallory said. ""To recuse yourself is not missing a vote, by the way.""
\
Mallory has managed to get legislation passed at the Statehouse despite the fact he is one of only 11 Democrats in the 33-member Senate. Of the 31 bills he sponsored, nine passed the House or Senate and five became law.
\
His critics use the word symbolic to describe many of the bills Mallory authored. But those familiar with Mallory's quiet style and the inner workings of the Statehouse say he has made his mark. Counting himself among Mallory's admirers is state Sen. Randy Gardner, a Republican who succeeded Mallory's father, William, as majority floor leader of the House.
\
""It certainly isn't fair to measure, especially someone like Sen. Mallory, on the basis of whether you were the prime sponsor of a bill that was signed into law,"" Gardner said. ""His reputation is, 'I'm not worried about the headline, I just want to get it done and it doesn't even have to be me.' ""
\
The Bowling Green lawmaker said Mallory is respectful of the General Assembly as an institution and ""strong in his beliefs While it may not get as many headlines, I think it gets the job done more often.""
\
Indeed, a restless Mallory can be seen crisscrossing the back of the Senate chamber during session catching the ears of other lawmakers and lobbyists. During floor debates, he chooses his words carefully and can be seen standing with his arms crossed, listening intently.
\
Rep. Tyrone Yates, a fellow Democrat from Cincinnati, said, ""He is extremely bright He has focus and a discipline that is admirable.""
\
Yates also admires Mallory for placing social concerns, such as getting more money for halfway houses and the Ohio Public Defender, at the top of his priorities.
\
Mallory is equally confident he can alter his leadership approach from a legislative to executive role. ""The dynamics are a little bit different as the mayor,"" he said. ""You have to work the dynamics of whatever situation you are in. I've found my style to be very, very effective in getting things done in Columbus.""
\
Mallory has a long record of voting against tax increases, but in 2003, he joined the Republican majority in supporting the largest package of tax increases in the state's history. Mallory defends that vote, saying the budget included more money for child care and health care for working families
\
""You have to take each budget cycle, each vote, based on the situation you are presented with,"" Mallory said. ""You have to make a decision about what you feel is a priority. At some level it is important that we take care of the needs of people at the state level so they can continue to provide for their families and grow and be productive.""
\
In 1999, Mallory voted against the education budget because ""we did not do what the (Supreme) Court said we needed to do We had not fundamentally changed the way we fund education. We still relied too heavily on local property taxes. We hadn't relieved people of that burden. And we hadn't provided any significant resources for the urban school districts throughout the state.""
\
Rep. Tom Brinkman Jr., a Cincinnati Republican, said he is not endorsing either candidate for mayor because both support abortion and both are for higher taxes.
\
Brinkman said he is not backing Mallory because, ""I do not like where he stands on issues important to me and my constituents.""
\
For example, it concerns Brinkman that Mallory supports gay rights and has the backing of organized labor unions.
\
Mallory bristles at being labeled a capital city insider, especially with accusations of corruption flying about.
\
""People recognize that I'm clearly not a part of the majority in Columbus. They know my record over the last 10 years. David (Pepper) might not know my whole record. People know that I am not a part of the mess as he describes it in Columbus but they also know that he is a part of the mess in Cincinnati.""

185,"
COLUMBUS - Ohio Governor Ted Strickland joined U.S. Labor Secretary Hilda Solis, state and local officials, and rail supporters from across the state to announce that Ohio has received $400 million in federal stimulus resources to invest in passenger rail.
\
With the goal of launching service by 2012, the 3C ""Quick Start"""" Passenger Rail Corridor will connect Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton and Cincinnati with daily train service for the first time in nearly 40 years.
\
The announcement comes as a result of months of far-reaching public and private support among Ohioans for intercity passenger rail.
\
""With today's historic announcement by President Obama, Ohio takes a major step toward modernizing our state's transportation infrastructure,"" said Governor Strickland. ""The 3C Corridor will create economic development opportunities and serve as a model of environmental sustainability. Most importantly, it will put thousands of Ohioans to work over the next few years.""
\
""I'd like to acknowledge all of the members of Ohio's congressional delegation who had the courage to support the Recovery Act - the federal stimulus bill - without which this historic announcement would not have been possible,"" Strickland added. ""Today, we are seeing the beginning of a new way to travel, and this new way to travel has left the station and is bound for Ohio.""
\
Ohio's 3C ""Quick Start"" Plan has drawn unprecedented support from citizens and community leaders, business owners and organized labor, sports teams and universities.
\
In October 2009, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) and the Ohio Rail Development Commission (ORDC) submitted a strong application seeking a share of $8 billion in federal passenger rail fonds made available under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
\
""Based on ridership, the 3C 'Quick Start' service would rank as the nation's 12th largest generator of passenger rail traffic in its inaugural year,"" said ODOT Director Jolene M. Molitoris. ""At the same time, we will work with Amtrak to strengthen Ohio's existing service connecting Cleveland, Toledo, and Cincinnati with Chicago, Pittsburgh and the East Coast.""
\
The application detailed the state's plans for investing, constructing, and operating a passenger rail service corridor that would serve an estimated 478,000 passengers in its first year of operation - based on projections by Amtrak, the nation's largest passenger rail service provider.
\
""Connecting Ohio's largest cites through rail will create immediate jobs and set our state on a path towards long-term economic growth,"" Senator Sherrod Brown said. ""Rail is good for business and good for our cities. For too long, our government passed tax cuts for the rich and giveaways to special interests. An investment in rail infrastructure is an investment in Main Street.""
\
Nearly six million Ohioans live within 15 miles of the 250-mile long 3C Corridor, a federally-designated high speed rail corridor and one of the most densely-populated corridors in the U.S. currently without passenger rail service.
\
""The 3C Corridor will bring sustainable, quality jobs to Northeast Ohio and high speed connectivity throughout the state,"" said Rep. Marcia L. Fudge. ""I was proud to vote for the Recovery Act, which funded this economic development and transportation project.""
\
Ohio's initial application requested $564 million in federal stimulus funds - a figure from a fall 2009 Amtrak study that provided estimates for needed investments in infrastructure, station stops and equipment. Those costs included a 30 percent construction cost contingency.
\
ODOT and ORDC will work with Amtrak and the state's freight railroads to quantify final investments needed to maximize capacity for fluid freight and passenger operations, and safely provide passenger service at speeds of up to 79 miles per hour.
\
""This Recovery Act funding is not only going to create jobs in Ohio, but it is a critical step in building the economy of America's future. We know that putting resources into transportation, infrastructure and clean energy projects will help to move our nation forward, revitalize manufacturing and strengthen the middle class,"" said Rep. Steve Driehaus. ""This smart investment is going to help speed our recovery, and put Cincinnati and Ohio on the path toward future growth and prosperity.""
\
In addition, the state will work with local communities on the costs and needs of eight station stops, including locations in downtown Cleveland, southwest Cleveland, downtown Columbus, downtown Dayton, the Cincinnati suburb of Sharonville, and Cincinnati, as well as in Springfield and near the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Riverside.
\
""I was so proud to work with the Governor, administration and a bipartisan delegation to get the President on board with funding that is crucial for a stronger economy in Ohio,"" Rep. Mary Jo Kilroy. ""We are the best place in the country for rail service restoration, expansion, and high speed manufacturing, and have a labor force that is just right for these types of investments in our infrastructure.""
\
Based on the same Amtrak study, ODOT estimates that annual revenue - including ticket sales - from the initial 3C ""Quick Start"" service will be approximately $12.2 million each year. The study then estimates that Ohio would need to identify approximately $17 million in additional annual state investment.
\
ODOT is identifying non-gas-tax dollars for these operating funds, including existing federal grant dollars, revenues from advertising on the train, and innovative public-private partnerships.
\
""Today's announcement is welcome news. This important funding will strengthen Ohio's rail system, create jobs, boost Ohio's economy and create an additional mode of transportation for more than six million Ohioans,"" said Rep. Betty Sutton. ""This project will provide an alternative option for those who commute to other parts of the state for work, and will give Ohioans an opportunity to travel and visit other parts of Ohio. Over time, it will spur economic development, which will create additional jobs. The enhanced rail system will also reduce our dependence on foreign oil and improve our environment.""
\
""I welcome Secretary Solis and this new investment in Ohio. Our location and transportation infrastructure make Ohio one of the most competitive manufacturing centers in America, and this can only help. Joining our cities together is good for our economy, good for our environment and good for Ohio,"" said Rep. Dennis Kucinich.
\
""This rail corridor is long overdue. I want to commend Governor Strickland for his tremendously bold leadership on this project,"" said Rep. Tim Ryan. ""Now is not the time for half-measures. This project will have a transformative effect for generations to come. I also look forward to the addition of a Cleveland-Mahoning Valley-Pittsburgh corridor as the next step in rail improvement.""
\
The $400 million stimulus investment in the 3C ""Quick Start"" is expected to result in at least 255 immediate construction jobs over a two year period. According to job-creation formulas by the U.S. Department of Commerce, this investment in Ohio will generate at least 8,000 spin-off jobs and could add at least $1.2 billion to Ohio's economy.

186,"
The three Republicans running to replace Katie Stine have similar positions on many issues - but different inspirations for running.
\
Stine, the Kentucky Senate's president pro tem, is retiring at the end of the year. Duking it out in the GOP primary for the Southgate Republican's 24th Senate District seat are Wil Schroder, Deb Sheldon and Brandon Voelker.
\
Schroder, 31, of Wilder is a felony prosecutor in Campbell County who wants to stop the ravages of the heroin epidemic.
\
Sheldon, 54, of Alexandria is a former Methodist minister who doesn't think the average person in Campbell County feels connected to state government and wants to change that.
\
Voelker, 41, of Cold Spring, was spurred to run by the controversy over the library tax.
\
Whoever wins the Republican primary will face Democrat Jason Steffen in the general election.
\
All three oppose using tolls to fund a new Brent Spence Bridge. All three also believe special taxing districts, such as libraries, need more oversight. What sets them apart is what they see as the top issue facing the district and the state.
\
Schroder
\
Schroder, in his job as a prosecutor, has seen the damage caused by the heroin epidemic first hand. Tougher penalties for heroin traffickers, he believes, would reduce heroin overdoses.
\
Reforms three years ago made by the General Assembly to reduce the jail population lowered penalties for heroin trafficking from a range of five to 10 years in prison to one to five years. Schroder wants to restore the penalty to five to 10 years and push the time back for parole eligibility.
\
""I think we need to punish the traffickers - I'm not talking about the users,"" Schroder said. ""These are people that are poisoning our society. They shouldn't get a lighter sentence.""
\
Voelker
\
For Voelker, special districts that can levy taxes concern him.
\
Voelker, an attorney, represented the tea party plaintiffs in Campbell and Kenton counties who challenged the ability of the library district boards to raise property taxes. Circuit court judges in both counties agreed the law didn't give the authority for libraries created by petition. That would wipe out the last 30 years of property tax increases for libraries in Kenton and Campbell counties as well as 70 other counties across the state. The libraries have appealed the decisions.
\
Voelker wants to pass a constitutional amendment that would require any tax increase from special districts, such as libraries, to have the approval of elected officials.
\
""Special districts give elected officials the ultimate cop-out to blame unelected boards,"" Voelker said. ""The buck needs to stop with elected officials.""
\
Sheldon
\
Sheldon said she decided to run because she felt state government ignored Northern Kentucky residents. Sheldon has worked in the local Republican Party and is the wife of Fourth Congressional District GOP chairman Troy Sheldon.
\
She pointed to the fact that both the state and federal government have not stepped forward to pay for the $2.6 billion Brent Spence Bridge project and have tried to toll the bridge instead.
\
Sheldon said she would hold several town hall meetings a year when the General Assembly wasn't in session to get feedback from residents to take down to Frankfort. This would be in addition to the caucus meetings all Northern Kentucky legislators hold in Northern Kentucky during the General Assembly sessions.
\
""I don't see the actual citizens of the commonwealth are being heard on the issues,"" Sheldon said. ""It is our responsibility as public servants to get input from citizens rather than sit in Frankfort and make up the rules.""

I cover how the actions of Congress and the General Assembly impact you. Read my blog at Cincinnati.com/blogs/ politics/category/kentucky or reach me at swartman@enquirer.com.
\
Wil Schroder Q&A
\
Where should the money come from to pay for the major projects such as the Brent Spence Bridge and the Ohio River Bridges Project in Louisville? Do you support tolls?
\
I believe that the Brent Spence Bridge should be paid for by the federal and state government, and I am a supporter of Sen. Rand Paul's emergency bridge fund proposal. As Sen. Paul stated, ""We are sending billions in foreign welfare, and spending hundreds of billions blowing up and rebuilding infrastructure in far-off countries."" I am not in favor of tolls. It is unfair and unrealistic to force Northern Kentuckians to pay 95 percent of the cost of the Brent Spence Bridge while at the same time the proposal for financing the Mountain Parkway in eastern Kentucky had 80 percent of its required funding coming from the state and federal government. As a state senator, I will fight to ensure that Northern Kentuckians are getting their fair share when it comes to the allocation of Kentucky's portion of federal road money.
\
Do you support amending the Kentucky Constitution to allow casinos?
\
I am in favor of letting the citizens of Kentucky decide this issue by putting it on the ballot for a constitutional amendment. This is a major issue that can and should be put to the voters directly. Having said that, I recognize that Northern Kentuckians have the option of driving short distances to casinos in Indiana, and more recently, Ohio. Kentucky would benefit by having that money remain in the commonwealth. While I believe that casino gaming would generate revenue for Kentucky that would help alleviate some of the state's current financial problems, I do not believe that it will solve all of Kentucky's financial issues. We still need sound financial stewardship from Frankfort, which I will help bring as a senator.
\
What tax reform do you support to make border areas more competitive with surrounding states?
\
Kentucky needs fundamental tax reform to stay competitive, not just with neighboring states but with states across the nation. Just recently, with Toyota's announcement that it will be relocating its Engineering & Manufacturing North America headquarters from Erlanger to Texas, Northern Kentucky again lost a significant number of jobs to a state that has a more business-friendly tax code. From day one, fundamental tax reform has been a key issue in my campaign, and it will be one of my top priorities as a state senator.
\
Should the General Assembly approve a tax-reform plan that would raise state revenue?
\
As a Republican, I believe that the best way to create revenue is by having a healthy, vibrant economy. Unfortunately, it seems that almost every month Northern Kentucky misses another opportunity to attract a new business. Companies continue to choose neighboring states because of their business-friendly atmosphere, which often includes tax incentives to locate to that state. We currently have an out-of-date tax system that is not business-friendly in today's modern economy. The General Assembly's focus should not be how to quickly raise revenue for the state, but rather how to create a healthy environment for businesses to be attracted to the region.
\
Should Kentucky raise its minimum wage from the current minimum of $7.25 per hour?
\
Kentucky should not raise its minimum wage. Study after study shows that such a move will result in higher unemployment rates and a higher cost of living in Kentucky, which will further weaken our already fragile business climate. A recent Legislative Research Commission analysis, for example, ""estimates 13,800 workers would lose their jobs"" if Kentucky increased its minimum wage. Raising the minimum wage would not only affect private businesses but also local governments and school districts, both of which are already struggling. I agree with Senate Majority Leader Damon Thayer, R-Georgetown, who recently stated in an Enquirer article that ""(w)e need to let the marketplace work when it comes to setting wages in this country and in this state.""
\
Do you support or oppose banning smoking statewide in all workplaces and indoor gathering places such as bars and restaurants?
\
I oppose statewide smoking bans. Personally, I dislike being around smoke and often choose to go to smoke-free businesses. However, I value private property rights as well as the free market. I believe that individual businesses should decide for themselves whether to become smoke-free. Within the last few years, Campbell County has seen an increase in smoke-free establishments because business owners realize that the clientele for smoke-free settings continues to grow. When enough people who dislike smoking continue to support smoke-free businesses only, establishments that currently allow smoking have the option of remaining as they are or changing to a smoke-free setting to remain competitive. I believe that the citizens of the commonwealth of Kentucky are perfectly capable of deciding for themselves whether they want to support restaurants, bars and other businesses that allow smoking and believe that the government should not interfere with those decisions.
\
Should Kentucky legalize marijuana, either outright or for prescribed medical purposes?
\
As the only candidate in this race who deals with Northern Kentucky's heroin and drug problem on a daily basis in my job as a felony prosecutor, I am always concerned about calls for the legalization of drugs. I was, however, in favor of the recent passage of Senate Bill 124, which will allow doctors at Kentucky's two university research hospitals to prescribe cannabidiol to patients who suffer from seizure disorders. And I believe there could be other medicinal purposes that as a state senator I would be willing to consider. Having lost both my parents to cancer, I have seen the numerous prescription drugs that are often given to combat pain. But I know from my experience as a prosecutor that these same legal prescription drugs are highly addictive and can lead to further problems with illegal drugs like heroin. For these reasons, I am open to considering the therapeutic value of medicinal marijuana as long as we are satisfied that it won't exacerbate our current problems with illegal drugs. And as with any prescribed medicine, we must ensure that patients are not abusing it. I am currently not in favor of legalizing marijuana outright.
\
Should convicted felons who have completed their sentences have their voting rights automatically restored?
\
When a person commits a felony, they must accept the repercussions for that action. I would not be in favor of automatically restoring the voting rights of convicted felons and believe there are numerous felony charges that are serious enough for a person to lose their voting rights. Furthermore, many first-time felony offenders are offered an opportunity to prevent their felony charge from going on their permanent record by successfully completing a period of supervision referred to as diversion. When completed successfully, these individuals are allowed to vote. For other felons, there is currently an established pathway through the Governor's office to petition to have their voting rights restored.
\
Deb Sheldon Q&A
\
Where should the money come from to pay for major projects such as the Brent Spence Bridge and the Ohio River Bridges Project in Louisville? Do you support tolls?
\
The money should come from the federal government. When the Brent Spence Bridge was first built, it was done with a 90 percent/10 percent match with the federal government. The bridge affects six states - Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida. It promotes interstate commerce and is vital to homeland security. Through the gas tax, we have been paying for infrastructure for years, only to see the funds go elsewhere. It seems a lot of Band-Aids are being applied throughout the commonwealth with no real fixes. Also, it appears that certain sections benefit more than others, and we need to find an equitable solution. Perhaps for each six-year plan, we concentrate on a different area, such as during the first plan, concentrating on Northern Kentucky; the second, Louisville; the third, Eastern Kentucky; and so on.
\
I do not believe at this time that tolls are our only option. We need to bring all ideas to the table and explore the alternatives. If it becomes apparent that tolls are inevitable - only after all other avenues have been thoroughly examined - I would recommend that the tolling collection systems be located where they least affect Campbell, Kenton, and Boone counties, so that the majority of the cost of this federal bridge is not on the backs of our Northern Kentucky residents.
\
Do you support amending the Kentucky Constitution to allow casinos?
\
Although I am aware of the issues Kentucky horse racing faces as more and more owners head off to greener pastures where the purses hold greater winnings, I still cannot say I would support extended gaming in Kentucky. Again, we are considering ways to raise revenue, when our goal should be to expand the tax base. I feel like everyone wants the quick fix rather than being accountable for what has already been wasted, providing the utmost transparency into government and getting rid of the special perks those holding office are now enjoying at the taxpayers' expense. Until the General Assembly realizes that they are public servants and not bosses who hand out goodies as they see fit, we will never realize real growth and prosperity in the commonwealth.
\
For this reason, I will refuse to enroll in the public pension system offered to the legislative body. Furthermore, you, the taxpayer, will not need to worry about me having better health care than you do. I am only one voice, but I will be YOUR voice - on that, you can surely depend!
\
What tax reform do you support to make border areas more competitive with surrounding states?
\
The first step in tax reform is to have transparency in where all the tax revenues are being deployed and then have an honest, public, bipartisan discussion on how we address the unfunded liabilities. I will support and champion any effort to bring transparency to all departments of the Kentucky General Assembly. Kentucky ranks in the bottom 10 percent in unfunded liabilities, and when viewed through the lens of a business owner who may be considering relocating here or remaining here, the risk of increased taxes to cover the unfunded liabilities outweighs the other strengths that we can put forward.
\
Another area that needs to be addressed is the cost of unemployment insurance (UI) that we are saddling our small business owners with today. Again, Kentucky ranks as one of the most expensive states in regard to UI.
\
Finally, we need to have an honest discussion regarding the funding we are putting forth to our state colleges and universities. We must insure that those precious tax dollars are getting the highest return for the commonwealth, by providing our young people with the skills and education necessary to be highly sought after by employers.
\
Should the General Assembly approve a tax-reform plan that would raise state revenue?
\
I believe the best way to raise revenue is not to raise taxes, but to expand the tax base. And this will only be accomplished when we succeed in making Kentucky a business-friendly environment. Obviously, we not only need to attract business to the commonwealth, we need to find a way to keep the companies we have here, wanting to stay here.
\
Should Kentucky raise its minimum wage from the current minimum of $7.25 per hour?
\
It's long been believed in some circles that Republicans do not care about the poor in society. However, just the opposite is true. Republicans want everyone to succeed, but we do not believe that can happen if there is no incentive for success. Raising the minimum wage is really not the issue. We must look at the bigger picture - education.
\
There is no reason any child graduating from high school should have to settle for minimum wage-paying jobs. Common Core is not going to help this. In our district, we have one of the very best independent school systems in the country. Wouldn't it make more sense to look at that system and recreate what it has already accomplished in all our other school systems rather than trying to reinvent the wheel for the whole nation?
\
Most people believe the answer is more money, smaller classrooms or longer school years; however, there comes a tipping point - not unlike a bell curve - where those very things become detrimental to the success of the system. If we model our less successful districts after the more successful ones, we not only improve all our schools, but we keep decision-making at the most local level, the place where we raise our children.
\
Do you support or oppose banning smoking statewide in all workplaces and indoor gathering places such as bars and restaurants?
\
I oppose a statewide ban on smoking in those areas because the decision whether to allow smoking in a privately owned business should be left up to the discretion of the owner. The free market will ultimately determine which businesses thrive, and which should change their policy.
\
For example, over one half of the businesses across the commonwealth have already gone smoke-free because they know what works best for themselves and their patrons. Furthermore, many counties and communities have passed resolutions concerning this issue, and it is not the state's place to usurp those decisions.
\
Should Kentucky legalize marijuana, either outright or for prescribed medical purposes?
\
I will support legalizing the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes, as studies prove that is beneficial in reducing seizures and in pain management.
\
I am a bit baffled why we spend so much time focusing on whether or not we should legalize marijuana for recreational use, when children are dying at an alarming rate all over the commonwealth due to the horrendous heroin epidemic. Do we really need to be adding to the problem at this time?
\
Addiction to heroin and other drugs is a disease that needs to be treated. Instead of locking up these addicts like monsters, we should be focusing our efforts on treatments and rehabilitation so these people may return to society as productive citizens and not criminals.
\
Moreover, I do not see how locking up addicts on a daily basis gives one unique expertise in solving this complex problem in our community.
\
Should convicted felons who have completed their sentences have their voting rights automatically restored?
\
Personally, I believe this voting issue is a red herring. Is this really about voting, or should we be having a discussion about how Kentucky has the third highest per capita (number of) felons in the United States? Currently, Kentucky has 243,842 total felons, including 180,984 that have done their time and are no longer under any type of supervision.
\
Kentucky law holds that being in arrears of $1,000 or missing three child support payments is a Class D felony. Theft of $500 also is a Class D felony. The interesting thing to note is that the prosecuting attorney has the power to decide who may receive probation, which remains on their record as a felony for life, and who may receive diversion, in which case, after a period of time, their record may be expunged - they are free to vote, be gainfully employed and enjoy their life no longer tagged as ""felon.""
\
I believe we should go further than only being concerned about voting rights. I would recommend that first-time, nonviolent Class D felons have the opportunity to have their records expunged at the end of their probation period, just as those who receive diversion have theirs expunged. This way, they not only will regain their voting rights, they will be able to rebuild their lives as productive members of our society.

Brandon Voelker Q&A
\
Where should the money come from to pay for major projects such as the Brent Spence Bridge and the Ohio River Bridges Project in Louisville? Do you support tolls?
\
It is the responsibility of the federal government. As Congressman Thomas Massie advised, we have spent $80 billion in nonmilitary spending in Afghanistan, more than enough to be build a single bridge. It is a matter of priorities.
\
Do you support amending the Kentucky Constitution to allow casinos?
\
The issue is one that should be presented to the voters for a yes or no vote and the will of the people decide.
\
What tax reform do you support to make border areas more competitive with surrounding states?
\
Tax reform is a fancy word for raising taxes. We do not need to reform, but rather reduce the taxes. For example, elimination of the state corporate income tax, since the money is taxed when paid out to shareholders. In addition to, we must lower taxes across the board, since lower taxes will attract more businesses creating more taxpayers. It is better to have more paying less than less paying more.
\
Should the General Assembly approve a tax-reform plan that would raise state revenue?
\
No, taxes are high enough already and the current tax code is not bringing in businesses. Again, we need more taxpayers paying taxes, not less taxpayers paying more.
\
Should Kentucky raise its minimum wage from the current minimum of $7.25 per hour?
\
No, free market should take precedence over any government mandated form of benefits.
\
Do you support or oppose banning smoking statewide in all workplaces and indoor gathering places such as bars and restaurants?
\
No, it is a private business owner's decision. While I do not smoke and avoid smoking businesses when with my children, it is a business owners right to decide, not government.
\
Should Kentucky legalize marijuana outright or for prescribed medical purposes?
\
Only for medical purposes and prescribed by a doctor. Medical professionals should determine whether it is needed for a patient, not a local drug dealer.
\
Should convicted felons who have completed their sentences have their voting rights automatically restored?
\
Not automatically, but certain offenses should be eligible to have their rights restored once they have fulfilled their sentence and taken time to become a productive member of society.

190,"INDIANAPOLIS – Democrat J.D. Ford made history on Election Day, Nov. 6, becoming the first openly gay person elected to the Indiana General Assembly.\He did so by defeating Sen. Mike Delph, a conservative stalwart perhaps best known for his staunch opposition to gay marriage.\Ford claimed victory at the Indiana Democratic Party election night gathering. He had 54.4 percent of the vote to Delph's 45.6 percent with 94 percent of precincts reporting.\""I just want to pause for a second to appreciate the historical significance that has happened tonight,"" he said to cheers. ""Tonight, I become Indiana's first openly gay lawmaker. Ladies and gentlemen, we just made history, and no one can take that from us.""\Ford, who turned 36 on Election Day, was one of the few bright spots in the election for Indiana Democrats. He ran an unabashedly progressive campaign in the district that includes suburban Indianapolis and Carmel.\Ford's win comes after narrowly losing to Delph four years earlier. Ford campaigned on increasing funding for public schools, raising the minimum wage, protecting the environment, fighting opioid addiction and passing hate crimes legislation that includes protections for gender identity and sexual orientation.\Indiana is among five states without some type of hate crime law, which generally includes enhanced sentences.\""Every marginalized group – people of color, women, Muslims, Jewish Hoosiers, seniors, LGBTQ+ Hoosiers, just to name a few – you now have a voice in the Indiana General Assembly. And I only intend to amplify it,"" he said.\Delph, who has held the seat since 2005, was a polarizing figure at the Statehouse, drawing criticism and praise, depending on your point of view, for his socially conservative policies on religious freedom, marriage, immigration and abortion. He also opposed expanded mass transit, hate crimes legislation and a gas tax increase to pay for road work.\Those positions sometimes brought Delph, 48, into conflict with his own party's leaders in the Senate and with business interests in his district, including the Indy Chamber, which threw its support behind Ford.\His detractors accused him of political grandstanding when he cited potholes as a reason to stop momentum on a bill that would have lifted a state ban on taxpayer funding of light rail.\IndyStar Reporter Chris Sikich contributed.\CREDIT: Tony Cook"

McCain and Hillary Clinton are feeding the clamor. They're out there pretending that a suspension of the 18.4-cents-a-gallon federal tax at the pump would do more good than harm. \In truth, it would encourage consumption of gas, which, among other things, would tend to send the price up while increasing U.S. dependence on foreign sources, and not exactly nurturing the environment. \What it would nurture is the delusion that high gas prices are a problem that the government can solve in a wonderful way: cutting taxes. \The holiday would just delay the arrival of the full impact of price hikes, without accomplishing anything big. \Its positive impact on family budgets would be at the slight rate of about $1.84 for every 10 gallons. \And yet, if you're Barack Obama, the temptation to embrace this gimmick must be intense. \Here we have a black presidential candidate who is having all manner of questions raised about whether he can connect with struggling white voters. \And here we see those voters staggering under the impact of gas-pump shock every time they fill up. And here we see polls showing that high gas prices are the main public problem on voters' minds these days. \And then we see this Harvard guy -- via a certain church on the South Side of Chicago -- asking people to trust him when he says the apparent gift they are being offered is a hoax. \Would you would want to be that guy? \Every veteran politician can point to some occasions when he or she has taken a tough stand.

We preferred Democrat Richard Cordray, both for his own long record of public service and out of concern that DeWine would do too little to counter the backward tendencies of a General Assembly dominated by his fellow Republicans.\His tenure so far has been a welcome surprise.\From a much-needed gas-tax hike to spending on children's needs to environmental protection, DeWine has focused on problems that the Republican legislature over the years largely has yawned at. In some cases, he has done so against opposition from others in his party.\Working with a supermajority of conservative Republicans, many of them to the right of right wing, parts of DeWine's agenda are only slightly more popular than a Democrat's with some members of his party. Yet he has been resolute in pursuing it, and part of the reason seems clear: Unlike most of his predecessors, Mike DeWine can do what he really wants.\The 72-year-old governor won't be running for any further public office other than re-election, and that's a different prospect from seeking the presidency or a senate seat. DeWine doesn't have to worry about alienating President Donald Trump's hard-right supporters or collecting chits from Statehouse politicians with their own ideological agendas.\And so it was that DeWine began his term in the wee hours of Jan. 14, swearing his oath of office in his Cedarville home and immediately issuing a raft of executive orders, including one to continue former Gov. John Kasich's order extending anti-discrimination protection in state hiring on the basis of gender identity or expression.\Another extended protection against discrimination to foster parents or parents of young children. Others created new positions and offices to tackle opioid addiction and focus on the needs of children and families in foster care.\We don't share all of DeWine's priorities; his race to sign a destructive nuclear-bailout bill was unfortunate, as was his support for an anti-abortion ""heartbeat bill"" that is extreme and clearly unconstitutional.\Those who know DeWine say it's easy to see what helps him find the possible in Ohio's contentious political environment: boundless energy and a genuinely likeable personality.\Where Kasich quarreled with lawmakers, they say, DeWine hosts lunches and picnics and listens. Local government officials, including the County Commissioners Association of Ohio, marvel that he shows up at their meetings and new-courthouse openings and listens to their concerns.\""He obviously loves being governor,"" one friend said. ""He enjoys the people.""\We thank Gov.

193,"
BURLINGTON - On June 21, Boone County Fiscal Court passed the 2017 budget without raising or adding taxes.
\
The county will see an estimated 5.2 percent increase in revenue and regular expenditures are down 1 percent.
\
Boone County Judge-executive Gary Moore said the budget was strong, and it is great to know there are no new taxes or fees.
\
""We really believe that the court has demonstrated strong leadership in approving this budget,"" County Administrator Jeff Earlywine said.
\
Earlywine said the 5.2 percent revenue increase can be attributed to payroll tax and the expansion of the tax base.
\
""It's our job to create an environment where the private sector can make that investment. They're the ones who create the new jobs,"" Earlywine said. ""Our role comes into play by good planning, making sure the infrastructure is in place and making sure ... we can provide the kind of services they need in a prompt manner.""
\
What the budget covers
\
Total government funds for Boone County in 2017 is a whopping $127,618,606.
\
Not all of it goes to the government; some funds are restricted by ordinances and the money goes straight to other programs. For example, $11.1 million will go to Boone County Board of Education Fund and $5.5 million will be transferred to the Assisted Housing Fund.
\
The operating budget for the county is $55 million, which includes the general fund, the jail fund and public works.
\
Over the course of fiscal year 2017, recurring general fund expenses are $33.1 million, down 1 percent from last year.
\
""We're pleased about that. When we look at the cost of government, we're holding expenditures down and doing it without impacting the quality of the services we're putting out there,"" Earlywine said.
\
The county will fund about 12 road and sidewalk projects. Restoring the Historic Burlington Courthouse is budgeted to cost $1.25 million.
\
Boone County has had a few good budget years, Earlywine said, and the county has started making efforts to pay off debt.
\
The county has a policy to allocate 25 percent of the total annual general fund revenue to emergency reserve funds. This year, Boone County will have more than $17 million in emergency funds.
\
In 2017, the county will spend $1.9 million on debt services. Earlywine said this time next year, the county will owe about $11 million. Compare that to 2007, when the county had just under $50 million in outstanding debt and paid $6.1 million in debt services.
\
Earlywine said the county has set aside about $4 million to pay off a portion of debt early. Last year the county prepaid $2.6 million, which took the debt services cost down $500,000.
\
""Every time we do that, it helps us out that following year because it reduces the total amount of principal payments that we have to make and it reduces our interest,"" Earlywine said.
\
There are struggles
\
Earlier in the year, county leaders realized they needed to reinvest in the public safety communication service, and while Earlywine said the budget sets aside $1 million for that, it will not be enough.
\
The county will receive less state funding in county road aid because the state gas tax is collecting less money. Earlywine said cuts from the state make the public works budget tighter.
\
Another struggle is the 911 fee. With fewer landline users and more cellphone users calling dispatch, the cost doesn't even out. Earlywine said the county will get $1 million, but will spend $4 million.

But that day has been put off.\ As senators were trying to finalize an energy bill before they left for a summer break, Republicans, at the last minute, got pushy and tried to shove through controversial judicial nominations that changed the subject to life-time appointments. So it looks like time has run out, and finishing up the energy bill likely will be put off until fall.\ In the end, that may not be so bad. The energy legislation is massive and complex. Many say this version is better and less pro- business than the last one, but it still favors conventional energy sources, and it does little to compel industry to reduce its or consumers' dependence on oil. Among the bill's incentives, it provides billions in subsidies for oil and gas producers, and it also eases the permitting process for these industries.\ Decisions were being made so quickly, some things weren't being sorted out well. It's not clear, for instance, whether the legislation really would prevent the market manipulation that led to California's energy crisis, and that is supposed to be one of the bill's reform measures.\ When the legislation comes back up, those who'd favor a more energetic effort at conservation and forcing less reliance on foreign oil might be able to make a few more incremental improvements. But, in the end, the biggest energy bill in years will be more pro-industry than pro-environment; that side simply has more power.\ But back to Ohio: Advocates for the state say they've convinced Senate leaders that Ohio is being unfairly penalized for its use of ethanol, a corn-based additive to gasoline that makes it a cleaner fuel. The policy quirk makes no sense when federal policy is to encourage wider usage of ethanol.\ The problem arises because ethanol is taxed by the feds at a lower rate than gasoline. As a big user of ethanol, Ohio sends less fuel tax money to Washington than it would if drivers were gassing up with plain gas, rather than gas laced with ethanol. But the more fuel tax money a state sends to Washington, the more it gets back from Washington to pay for its roads and bridges.\ By Ohio's estimates, the state loses $150 million every year because it favors a cleaner fuel.\ For perspective, the 6-cent gas tax increase that Ohio adopted this year and that will be phased in over three years will raise more than $500 million annually; even next to that number, an infusion of $150 million every year is real money.\ Ohio's case for fixing the ethanol penalty is compelling, and delaying passage of the energy bill won't change the essential facts. But, still, U.S. Sens. George Voinovich and Mike DeWine will have to make sure that recent promises really are kept in the fall."
195,"WASHINGTON - A federal highway bill approved by a Senate committee on Wednesday would give Ohio billions of dollars more for transportation projects from the gasoline taxes it collects.\The bill could come with a price, however: Gas taxes might increase as well.\Senators haven't decided how to pay for the $255 billion highway bill. Part of the money could come from a gas tax increase to cover inflation, said Sen. George Voinovich.\""That is a whole lot better way to do it than to borrow the money and make people who don't use the highway system pay for it,"" said Voinovich, an Ohio Republican and member of the committee.\Still, the change made Wednesday in the funding formula marks a significant victory for states like Ohio that collect more money in federal gas taxes than they are allotted in highway funding.\Ohio is called a ""donor"" state because it gets back 90.5 cents for every dollar it collects in federal gas taxes. The rationale is that more populated states should help pay for a national highway system that runs through less populated states.\Under the bill approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Ohio would get 95 cents back for every dollar it collects. That means Ohio would get $2.1 billion in extra revenue over the six years covered by the bill, for a total of $7.9 billion.\The bill still must pass the full Senate and be reconciled with the House version.\Coupled with a bill pending in Congress that would increase the amount of money Ohio gets back for ethanol fuel taxes, the state is looking at a possible surge in highway funding.\""It's a bonanza, it really is. It would create the most aggressive highway construction effort ever seen,"" Voinovich said. ""We are going to see jobs all over the state.""\Gov. Bob Taft said the bill's passage represents ""a key milestone"" in his transportation funding agenda.\""For too long, Ohio has sent more federal highway dollars to Washington than it has received,"" Taft said. ""This committee vote clearly signals that our concerns have been heard in Washington.""\Although ranked 35th in the nation by geographic size, Ohio has the fourth largest interstate network that carries the fourth largest amount of truck traffic. The state is within a 600-mile drive of half of the nation's population and is considered a crossroad for America's manufacturing and agricultural industries."
196," Just as gasoline prices are settling back to the $2-per-gallon range, a new study sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce suggests that one answer to the growing need for highway maintenance funds would be to levy an extra tax on drivers of fuel-efficient cars.\ That's right: at a time when this country desperately needs to overhaul its energy policy to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels, there's a serious proposal being floated to penalize the use of hybrid cars, thereby subsidizing the gas-guzzlers.\ Could anything be more wrongheaded?\ The suggestion grows out of an otherwise thoughtful analysis by the National Chamber Foundation that warns our highway system will fall into disrepair unless we find additional dollars.\ Highway maintenance is paid for by taxes on gas at the pump. But because these taxes are not indexed for inflation, their buying power has not kept up. The upshot is that in order to fill the potholes and resurface the bridges, we will need to raise an additional $500 million during the next decade.\ And that's just to keep roads repaired. The cost of improvements - - new interchanges and the like -- raises the shortfall during the next 10 years to $1.1 trillion.\ Where should the money come from?\ The simple answer is to raise gasoline taxes. While we've all cried the blues in recent days as prices at the pump shot skyward in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the truth is that gasoline is comparatively cheap.\ How cheap? Gas at $2 a gallon is a bargain compared to soft drinks. Doing a little supermarket research, the least expensive I could find Coke was $3.84 a gallon. Designer coffee can cost more than $30 a gallon. Sparkling water: $7.40 a gallon. Bottled tea more than $10 a gallon. And so forth.\ In Europe, gasoline is commonly more than twice the price here, ranging from $5 to $7 per gallon. Small wonder you see smaller cars with higher gas mileage on the roads across the Pond.\ The cost of raw gasoline is the same there as here. The difference in price is attributable to taxes. The net of which is that fuel economy is emphasized, the consumption of our dwindling oil reserves is slowed, and the environment is treated more kindly.\ All good things.\ Even raising federal and state gas taxes a few pennies would solve the projected highway fund shortfall. But, really, that doesn't go far enough.\ We have a sensible and longstanding tradition in this country of using tax policy to influence behavior. That's why home mortgages are tax deductible. The idea is to encourage home ownership.\ Similarly, higher taxes on gas would build a market for more fuel- efficient cars and trucks. And they would generate funds needed to develop more and better mass-transit systems.\ It must be acknowledged that the gas tax is regressive, putting a disproportionately larger burden on the poor and working poor. Some accommodation would be necessary for people of limited means -- a tax credit, perhaps.\ But let's face it: there is only so much oil in the ground. Generations hence will marvel in dismay that we actually burned this stuff instead of preserving it for all its alternative uses (plastics, medicine, dyes, etc.).\ We need to change our habits. And let me confess: I'm as guilty as anyone. I've got an SUV, built right here in Moraine, sitting in my driveway. I love that car despite the pain it causes at the pump.\ But we can't keep this up. We have to find ways to conserve. Higher gasoline taxes, while burdensome, make good sense. Levying additional taxes on hybrids and other fuel-efficient cars is just nuts.\ Jeff Bruce is the editor of the Dayton Daily News.

197,"KETTERING -- Ohio Gov. John Kasich's proposal to raise taxes on the oil and gas industry and use the money to lower income taxes was met with applause on Thursday when he spoke at the Montgomery County Republican Party's Lincoln/Reagan Gala dinner fundraiser. \Kasich, in his first opportunity to pitch his tax proposal to crowd of Republicans and business leaders since he announced it on Wednesday, said his ""modernization"" of the state oil and gas taxes is an opportunity that the state cannot afford to miss. \""Thar's gold in them thar' hills in Ohio,"" he said. \The eastern portion of the state has oil and gas buried in the Utica and Marcellus shales, resources that drillers want to reach using hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking."" Kasich proposes a 1 percent tax on natural gas and 1.5 percent initially on crude oil from shale wells. The new money -- as much as $500 million annually --would be used for an across-the-board reduction in income taxes. \His proposal has been criticized by some Republicans, the oil and gas industry and Zach Schiller of the left-leaning think tank, Ohio Policy Matters, which contends the income tax cut will not boost the economy but will create a wider gap between the rich and the poor. \During the dinner Kasich told the crowd of about 350 people that Ohio taxes total 20 cents on a $107 barrel of oil. \He said energy companies will make a lot of money if the drilling performs as expected and he believes Ohioans should benefit from it, rather than have all the profits leave the state. \Kasich also called for strong regulations on the oil and gas industry, saying officials must be sure ""we don't choose between jobs and the environment."" \Kasich said Ohioans will not support the industry if wells explode and ground water gets contaminated. \In comments afterward Kasich acknowledged that natural gas is not as profitable as it once was and so may not be as reliable a source of taxes as oil. But he said his proposal would tie the tax cuts to the revenue, so that schools and local governments would not be subject to additional cuts in state funding. He said he has heard the concerns of local officials about the state cuts they've already endured. \Kasich also outlined his proposals to raise student achievement in schools, make state government more efficient and use ""common-sense"" regulations so businesses can grow. He said Ohio is on the right track -- with an auto industry that is growing and new jobs coming to the state. \""People have a sense that things are getting better,"" Kasich said. \Those interviewed after the speech said they liked what they heard. \""I like the idea of creating jobs and I think he's doing it,"" said R.C. Harrison, of Kettering. \He and Merle F. Wilberding, a Dayton attorney, both said the oil and gas tax idea is an opportunity for the state and would be a good way to cut income taxes. \""I was shocked at how low the (tax) levy is on those companies,"" said Wilberding.\Credit: By Lynn Hulsey, Staff writer"

BURLINGTON - On June 21, Boone County Fiscal Court passed the 2017 budget without raising or adding taxes.
\
The county will see an estimated 5.2 percent increase in revenue and regular expenditures are down 1 percent.
\
Boone County Judge-executive Gary Moore said the budget was strong, and it is great to know there are no new taxes or fees.
\
""We really believe that the court has demonstrated strong leadership in approving this budget,"" County Administrator Jeff Earlywine said.
\
Earlywine said the 5.2 percent revenue increase can be attributed to payroll tax and the expansion of the tax base.
\
""It's our job to create an environment where the private sector can make that investment. They're the ones who create the new jobs,"" Earlywine said. ""Our role comes into play by good planning, making sure the infrastructure is in place and making sure ... we can provide the kind of services they need in a prompt manner.""
\
What the budget covers
\
Total government funds for Boone County in 2017 is a whopping $127,618,606.
\
Not all of it goes to the government, some funds are restricted by ordinances and the money goes straight to other programs.
\
For example, $11.1 million will go to Boone County Board of Education Fund and $5.5 million will be transferred to the Assisted Housing Fund.
\
The operating budget for the county is $55 million which includes the general fund, the jail fund and public works.
\
Over the course of fiscal year 2017, recurring general fund expenses are $33.1 million, down 1 percent from last year.
\
""We're pleased about that. When we look at the cost of government, we're holding expenditures down and doing it without impacting the quality of the services we're putting out there,"" Earlywine said.
\
The county will fund about 12 road and sidewalk projects. Restoring the Historic Burlington Courthouse is budgeted to cost $1.25 million.
\
Planning for the future
\
Boone County has had a few good budget years, Earlywine said, and the county has started making efforts to aggressively pay off debt.
\
The county has a policy to allocate 25 percent of the total annual general fund revenue to emergency reserve funds. This year, Boone County will have over $17 million in emergency funds.
\
In 2017, the county will spend $1.9 million on debt services. Earlywine said this time next year, the county will owe about $11 million.
\
Compare that to 2007, when the county had just under $50 million in outstanding debt and paid $6.1 million in debt services.
\
Earlywine said the county has set aside about $4 million to pay off a portion of debt early. Last year the county prepaid $2.6 million, which took the debt services cost down $500,000.
\
""Every time we do that, it helps us out that following year because it reduces the total amount of principal payments that we have to make and it reduces our interest,"" Earlywine said. ""It really helps us with the operating budget.""
\
Even with a strong budget, there are struggles
\
""There's a lot to feel good about and there's a lot to be thankful for but our budget and our county isn't without challenges,"" Earlywine said.
\
Earlier in the year, county leaders realized they needed to reinvest in the public safety communication service, and while Earlywine said the budget sets aside $1 million for that, it will not be enough.
\
The county will receive less state funding in county road aid because the state gas tax is collecting less money. Earlywine said cuts from the state make the public works budget tighter, because they have to continue to fix roads without the funding.
\
Another struggle is the 911 fee, which doesn't cover the cost of dispatch services in the county. With fewer landline users and more cellphone users calling dispatch, the cost doesn't even out. Earlywine said the county will get $1 million, but will spend $4 million on services.
"
200,"There are a lot of reasons for Midwesterners -- still tied to the auto industry, despite everything -- to like an idea proposed by Akron-area Democratic Congresswoman Betty Sutton (and supported by local Republican Reps. Mike Turner and Steve Austria). \Her idea is to use $4 billion in Energy Department stimulus funds to spur auto sales while helping to reduce emissions and increase fuel efficiency in the nation's auto fleet. \The proposal, known as ""Cash for Clunkers,"" would offer up to $4,500 to car owners who agree to trade in their old, gas-guzzling vehicles for new cars with better gas mileage. The plan still needs work. That's coming now that it has passed the House and is headed to the Senate. But it's promising, both as a stimulus and for its environmental benefits. \In Europe, where versions of ""cash for clunkers"" are already in play, the results have been promising. Car sales have jumped significantly. The Wall Street Journal reports Germany saw a 20 percent gain in auto sales in February alone, and there is evidence car owners truly did swap primarily for compact, fuel-efficient vehicles. \Would the impact be as great here? It's hard to say. Germany has more incentives for drivers to be fuel-sensitive. A high gas tax makes the per-gallon cost of gasoline well above U.S. prices. And the Germans tax big cars heavily. \The bill the U.S. House passed may not have the right incentives. In that version, the vouchers can only be used for new cars, not used cars. And owners would have to just turn over their old cars for no tradein. (Remember, they're being scrapped). \The old cars have to be operable and have been insured for the past year. So they can't really be true junkers. At the same time, it wouldn't make economic sense for an individual to turn over a car worth more than $4,500. You'd be better off selling it or doing a traditional trade-in. \Also, if you're buying a new car, you can probably expect to pay at least $12,000. That could be a tall order for many folks worrying about their jobs in an economic downturn. \Meanwhile, environmental groups aren't sure the bill, as it stands now, serves the planet well enough to justify its cost. For instance, the sliding scale in the law would allow a car owner to get $3,500 for trading up from a vehicle getting 18 miles to the gallon to one that gets 22 miles to the gallon. Environmentalists say that's not enough payoff. They'd like to require the new car be even more fuel-efficient. \The opportunity is there for fixes to be made. If senators put some work into refining it, ""cash for clunkers"" could be good for the environment, could reduce demand for oil and could spur car sales. \All of those outcomes would be good for Ohioans. Despite the dramatic downsizing of General Motors and Delphi, Ohio still has a lot of jobs tied to the auto industry directly and indirectly. The state needs the industry to prosper and hopefully even start growing eventually. Given that the stimulus funds are to be spent one way or another, this is a well-conceived way."

COLUMBUS - A major Wall Street credit-rating agency has lowered Ohio's long-term fiscal outlook to negative, a move that could be a precursor to a lowered credit rating.
\
Moody's Investors Service lowered the state's outlook from stable to negative, citing Ohio's ongoing tax cuts and weakening manufacturing sector. The state's credit rating, however, remains at Aa1, the second-highest possible.
\
Moody's took the action just as Ohio was preparing to go to the bond market today to borrow $250 million as part of its ongoing school construction and renovation program.
\
Just last week, Gov. Ted Strickland, preparing his first budget proposal, had cited the high credit rating as a bright spot in the state's weak revenue picture, helping to save the state millions in interest when it comes to bonds for schools, roads, bridges, and other projects.
\
He will propose a two-year transportation budget today that is dependent on long-term bonds largely guaranteed with gas-tax revenue.
\
""The state is facing spending pressure for health care and education. That, combined with the enacted tax cuts, means Ohio's revenue performance has been relatively weak,"" said Robert Kurttier, Moody's team-managing director in public finance. ""It is facing difficult economic challenges at a time when many states are experiencing strong revenue growth.""
\
Moody's and other credit-rating houses had lowered Ohio's long-term outlook in 2001 during Gov. Bob Taft's administration when the state was depleting its reserves and relying on one-time money to patch a hemorrhaging state budget.
\
But the state's credit rating was never lowered, and its outlook eventually was restored to stable in 2004 after passage of a budget that included, among other things, a temporary penny-on-the-dollar increase in the state sales tax, half of which was eventually made permanent.
\
""One of the strengths that contributed to Ohio's high-credit rating during prolonged economic weakness was that the state worked very aggressively to maintain its budget balance and made hard decisions over a long period of time to bolster or maintain the state's credit,"" Mr. Kurttier said. ""But those pressures have continued for a long period of time and continue to this date.""
\
The state is in the middle of a five-year overhaul of its tax structure, including massive changes in business taxation and a gradual 21 percent cut in personal income taxes. Mr. Strickland has said he has no plans to interfere with the tax reforms nor to ask tax or fee hikes in his upcoming budget plan.
\
""[Moody's] outlook is not much different than what the governor has been talking about - flat revenues and a challenging budget environment,"" said Strickland spokesman Keith Dailey.
\
""He is committed to living within our means and investing in what matters most.""
\
The state has about $9.15 billion in outstanding debt guaranteed by general budget tax collections. Less than $1 billion of that carries a variable interest rate that could be adversely affected by a downgrade of the state's credit rating.
\
Meanwhile, House Republicans again said one of their top priorities will be to reduce or eliminate Ohio's estate tax, while Senate Republicans said a personal income tax deduction for college tuition was near the top of their goals.

When the $2.6 billion Brent Spence Bridge replacement suffered two major setbacks in Frankfort last week, supporters of the project were troubled, its opponents cheered, and outside observers wondered, ""What the heck is going on in Kentucky?""
\
To some in the region, the path forward seems obvious: The bridge is outdated, overcrowded and unsafe, and it needs to be replaced as soon as possible.
\
Federal transportation officials and members of Congress have said they won't foot the entire bill, so the region has to pick up some of the tab in the form of tolls.
\
But the issue seems equally clear to others: The bridge carries an interstate critical to national commerce, and drivers already pay federal gas tax, so Congress should be forced to replace it - and we can afford to wait until they do.
\
It's a wide gap, and the divide runs deeper in Northern Kentucky than in any other part of Greater Cincinnati. But the reality is that the project is unlikely to move forward without some common ground.
\
When Kentucky's House of Representatives yanked $37 million in state money and allowed a ban on Brent Spence tolls to pass the chamber last week, legislative leaders were essentially telling Northern Kentucky, ""You need to figure this out, and then get back to us.""
\
""One of the ways you judge a region is its ability to develop and execute strategies on behalf of its future. And we're just not demonstrating our ability to get behind a strategy and work it in the competitive environment of Frankfort,"" said Jim Votruba, chairman of the Northern Kentucky CEO Roundtable, which came out in support of tolls for the project last month.
\
But why is the region so divided? And how can those divisions be bridged?
\
For the past 15 years, the Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce has advocated for the project in Washington, D.C., Frankfort and within the region, making the case that replacing the now 50-year-old span is a critical priority.
\
For more than a decade, nobody really disagreed with that premise.
\
Then, two years ago, tolls came into the equation.
\
More than 150 Greater Cincinnati companies formed a coalition in mid-2012 called Build Our New Bridge Now to advance the project. The group publicly raised the possibility of tolls - or, euphemistically, ""user fees"" - for the first time.
\
Some advocates of the project now privately concede that may have been a miscalculation: pushing for tolls so early in the process allowed opposition to emerge and coalesce.
\
By the time Ohio and Kentucky transportation officials issued a preliminary financial plan in December 2013 that officially recommended tolls, opposition was already strong.
\
The Northern Kentucky Tea Party has been the loudest voice against tolls, mobilizing its members and working to convince others to oppose tolls. Local lawmakers say their offices in Frankfort are flooded with messages to that effect.
\
""So much of the debate over the bridge and over tolls is a debate over the role of government, the size of government and what government should do,"" Votruba said. ""I think our legislators have a difficult time charting a course among these various political interest groups, and it makes it difficult.""
\
A growing number of cities - at least 10 - have passed anti-toll resolutions since 2012, along with both Boone and Kenton counties.
\
Fort Mitchell Mayor Chris Wiest has led the charge to convince cities up and down Interstate 75 to sign on to the resolutions. Some, like Covington, are concerned tolls will divert a large amount of local traffic through their communities.
\
""This is not a business-versus-tea-party issue. I think this is a big-business-versus-community sentiment,"" Wiest said. ""You have a number of jurisdictions in Northern Kentucky that have passed resolutions against tolls. This is a community that does not want tolls, adamantly.""
\
For Wiest and many others, the issue is one of fairness: We pay federal gas taxes, so why should we pay tolls for a federal interstate bridge?
\
Federal officials have said the money is simply not there, but toll opponents disagree.
\
""As soon as you accept that as an answer, you give the federal government a free pass on it,"" Wiest said.

Ask a GPS for directions from central Cincinnati to Batavia and you'll likely be sent through northern Kentucky via I-471 and I-275. It's a geographical peculiarity that puzzles newcomers, the fact that many Cincinnati drivers must cut through another state to head east in Ohio.
\
The lack of a direct traffic artery between Downtown and the eastern portions of our region is a major reason behind the proposed Eastern Corridor, a collection of transportation projects that include a new highway, a commuter train, bike and pedestrian paths and upgrades to existing roads. Designed to alleviate congestion and improve access between the East Side and Downtown, the Eastern Corridor project has spent years on the drawing boards, and the communities in its path have spent much of this year debating and reacting to current plans.
\
There are benefits to building transportation options through the eastern portion of the region, but there are significant drawbacks as well. We believe the potential damage of much of this project - to significant cultural and historical assets, to East Side businesses and communities, to the environment and to the region as a whole - is too great to justify it. Irreplaceable treasures and essential components of our heritage lie in the path of proposed development, and experience shows that the damage wrought by projects such as this is impossible to reverse.
\
The goals of the Eastern Corridor are also insufficient to justify both the cost - estimated at $1.4 billion for all the components - and the damage it could inflict. Research suggests that building new roads only temporarily alleviates traffic congestion; after a period, the greater capacity attracts more drivers, and the congestion returns. Especially in an era of tight budgets and declining gas-tax revenue, major road projects should be approved only if the congestion they're alleviating will lead directly to greater economic development. Several regional projects, such as the MLK interchange on I-71 and the new Brent Spence Bridge, meet those requirements; the Eastern Corridor does not.
\
In addition to a relocated Ohio 32 from Eastgate to Red Bank Road, the Eastern Corridor project also proposes a light-rail line from Milford to Downtown known as the Oasis Line. Again, there is much to like about this proposal: It uses an existing rail line, and it is lower-hanging fruit than many other proposed rail lines in the region.
\
But there are significant negatives as well. It fails to connect employment centers and instead concentrates on bringing eastern commuters Downtown, a pattern that rejects the contours of recent job-growth patterns. Its ridership is projected to be around the same as the Cincinnati streetcar but would cost several times as much to build. The region's first rail project needs to be a slam dunk; anything less would give ammunition to the region's ample rail opponents and potentially torpedo other, more logical rail projects. The Oasis line as proposed is not a slam dunk.
\
The Eastern Corridor consists of four separate components: the relocation of Ohio 32, the Oasis rail line, a set of upgrades to 32 around the I-275 interchange in Eastgate, and improvements to Red Bank Road from U.S. 50 to I-71. The Eastgate improvements, some of which are already under way, make sense, and the Red Bank improvements, if handled correctly, could also help traffic run more smoothly along that increasingly important corridor.

206,"
Taxpayers filing their 1040s are likely wondering just where all their hard-earned tax dollars are going, anyway.
\
Washington will spend $31,406 per household in 2010 - the highest level in American history (adjusted for inflation). It will collect $18,276 per household in taxes. The remaining $13,130 represents this year's staggering budget deficit per household, which, along with all prior government debt, will be dumped in the laps of our children.
\
Government spending has increased by $5,000 per household since 2008, and nearly $10,000 per household over the past decade. Yet there is no free lunch: If spending is not reined in, then eventually taxes must also rise by $10,000 per household.
\
Washington will spend this $31,406 per household as follows:
\
Social Security/Medicare: $9,949. The 15.3 percent payroll tax, split evenly between the employer and employee, covers most of these costs. This system can remain sustainable only if there are enough workers to support all retirees, which is why it risks collapsing under the weight of 77 million retiring baby boomers. Unless these programs are reformed, paying all promised benefits would eventually require doubling all income tax rates.
\
Defense: $6,071. The defense budget covers everything from military paychecks to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to the research, development and acquisition of new technologies and equipment. Lawmakers drastically reduced military spending after the collapse of communism in the early 1990s. The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks reversed this trend, and the inflation-adjusted $2,472 per household increase since 2000 has returned military spending closer to its historical levels (but still lower than during previous wars).
\
Anti-poverty programs: $5,466. Nearly half of this spending subsidizes state Medicaid programs that provide health services to poor families. Other low-income spending includes: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps, housing subsidies, child-care subsidies, Supplemental Security Income and low-income tax credits. President George W. Bush increased anti-poverty spending to record levels, and it has grown an additional 32 percent since the end of 2008 under President Barack Obama.
\
Unemployment benefits: $1,640. Unemployment costs have surged by 411 percent during the recession.
\
Interest on the federal debt: $1,585. The federal government is $13 trillion in debt. It owes $9 trillion to public bond owners, and the rest to other federal agencies (mostly to repay the Social Security trust fund, which lawmakers raided annually before the program went into deficit in 2010). Record-low interest rates have recently held down these costs. However, the national debt is set to double by 2020, which will combine with higher interest rates to raise annual interest costs to nearly $6,000 per household.
\
Veterans' benefits: $1,052. The federal government provides income and health benefits to war veterans. Spending is up 83 percent since 2000.
\
Federal employee retirement benefits: $1,018. This spending funds the retirement and disability benefits of federal employees, including the military.
\
Education: $914. Education spending is primarily a state and local function; 9 percent of the total comes from Washington. The federal education budget has leaped 125 percent since 2000. Most federal dollars are spent on low-income school districts, special education and college student financial aid.
\
Highways/mass transit: $613. Most highway and mass-transit spending is financed by the 18.4 cent per-gallon federal gas tax. Washington subtracts an administrative cost and sends this money back to the states with numerous strings attached.
\
Health research/regulation: $550. This spending is up 50 percent since 2001, and much of this growth is concentrated in the National Institute of Health. The category also includes the Food and Drug Administration and dozens of grant programs for health providers.
\
Mortgage Credit: $470. While most of the bank bailouts occurred last year, the bailouts of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the rest of the housing market continue.
\
The programs listed above cover $29,328 per household. The remaining $2,078 is allocated to all other federal programs, including justice, international affairs, natural resources, the environment, regional development, farm subsidies, social services, space exploration, air transportation and energy.
\
Taxpayers - and the next generation that will be paying nearly half of the bill - must decide for themselves if they're getting their money's worth.

207,"State and local bridges aren't ready for pending moves by Congress that could allow heavier trucks on U.S. roads and quickly hit Ohio taxpayers with a $40 million bill, Ohio county engineers said Wednesday. \The U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is scheduled to vote today to allow heavier trucks on the roads -- up to 97,000 pounds for single-trailer trucks and 100,000 pounds for double- and triple-trailer trucks, an increase of up to 25 percent. The limit is now 80,000 pounds. \It's the biggest weight hike in memory, said Montgomery County Engineer Paul Gruner. County engineers would be required to retest all local bridges and post new load limits, racking up the millions in compliance costs, Gruner said. \Meanwhile, trucking firms would cut costs by fielding fewer drivers and trucks, he added. \A group of small-business truckers condemned the legislation, calling it the product of ""big business interests."" \""Truck drivers know firsthand that heavier and longer trucks are much harder to maneuver and put additional stress on our already deteriorating highways and bridges,"" said Todd Spencer, executive vice president of the 150,000-member Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association. He said heavier trucks will require more distance and time to merge onto highways than current on-ramp designs allow. He added that ""traffic flow will be interrupted and the resulting speed differentials could increase the chances for collisions."" \""This is an all-out assault on the current weight and length limits that help protect the safety of all drivers, and our roads and bridges,"" said Fredrick B. Pausch, the County Engineers Association of Ohio's executive director. \State bridges have not been adequately maintained, Pausch said, with 22 percent of the nearly 26,000 bridges in the county road system deemed structurally deficient -- meaning they need maintenance, repair, rehabilitation or replacement -- or functionally obsolete -- meaning they do not meet modern federal requirements for clearance and other safety factors. \Gruner said a similar percentage of the 507 bridges maintained by Montgomery County need upgrades. \""We are at a critical juncture in planning our future structural needs,"" said Pausch. ""Currently, there is not enough money to meet the severe needs of our highway system. How can we take on a new burden due to greater truck weights and sizes?"" \Darrin Roth, director of highway operations for the American Trucking Association, said the legislation only applies to federal highways and said states still have the option to restrict heavier trucks. \As written, the bill known as the American Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Act of 2012 would allow the Department of Transportation to study a fee assessment on trucks that should offset additional road and bridge wear. Roth said the higher weight limit should create fuel savings and cut back on overall costs to shippers because fewer trucks would be on the road. Additional truck axles would be required to raise the weight above the current maximum, reducing road wear. \Citing Ohio Revised Code, Roth said that the state already allows trucks hauling coal, farm products, logs, solid waste, minerals, asphalt, concrete, manure, turf, sod, silage and various wood products to operate off the Interstate system at 7.5 percent above legal limits. \The last increase in the federal highway gas tax was in 1993, Pausch said, and the cost to repair and maintain roads and bridges under current conditions exceeds federal funding. Pausch noted that congressional committee members include Ohio Reps. Bob Gibbs, R-Holmes County, and Jean Schmidt, R-Clermont County. A spokesman for Schmidt's office said a federal study found that raising truck weights could cut road repair expenses because fewer trucks would be on the road. \Last year, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that some of Georgia's largest companies, including Coca-Cola and Georgia-Pacific, were lobbying state and federal officials to raise weight limits on highways, a move they said would help the economy and the environment. There have been previous attempts to raise the weight limit, all of them unsuccessful, Pausch said.\Credit: By Steve Bennish, Staff Writer"
208,"Staff Writer\and PERONET DESPEIGNES\USA TODAY\ZANESVILLE -- A federal bill which would provide millions of dollars in road improvements to the area has been held up in Congress and faces a possible presidential veto.\However, officials remain hopeful that the money will come this way.\The highway bill, which Congress has to reauthorize every six years, extends the government's authority to tap the Highway Trust Fund, financed chiefly by the 18.4-cents-per-gallon federal gas tax. The bill, now stuck in Congress, would authorize at least $280 billion in new federal aid for highways and mass transit systems nationwide over the next six years.\Locally, the House version of the bill includes more than $10 million for Muskingum County, which was secured through efforts by U.S. Representative Bob Ney (R.-St. Clairsville). The projects included in it are $10 million for the Ohio 93/ U.S. 40 connector road, $600,000 for the Ohio 146 traffic light and lane expansion project and $65,000 for signs and shelters for the ZBus Southeast Area Transit System.\""Although I understand the need for Congress not to overspend in these tight budget times, this is an important safety project,"" said James Fonseca, Ohio University-Zanesville dean. ""With the increased enrollment at OUZ and MATC and with more traffic in general on Newark Road, we have had a number of serious accidents.""\The two colleges which share the Newark Road campus have worked actively working with city, county and state officials on this project. It is expected to have benefits beyond the two colleges.\""The project will also improve traffic flow and increase safety ... where entrances to Starlight School, the County Home and the Animal Shelter,"" Fonseca said.\A temporary traffic light was installed this week, with electricity expected to be connected Wednesday. The light will go fully operational in early June.\""I don't know why they didn't do this a long time ago. I mean thousands of people go to these schools,"" said Nikki Roberts, 19, a student at Ohio University-Zanesville.\The Ohio 146 project is only one of many which is depending on funds from the federal government.\The key to making things better nationwide is the huge highway bill now stalled in Congress, many congressional Republicans argue. Ohio Sen. George Voinovich and other Republicans say the bill not only will reduce traffic woes nationwide but also will provide thousands of jobs, an invaluable commodity in an election year still plagued in many areas by a troubled job market.\That combination would seem irresistible, but congressional Republicans' plans are vigorously opposed by another Republican: President Bush.\The White House, eager to enhance its credibility on budget issues as the federal deficit approaches a record $500 billion this year, is threatening to veto any highway bill that exceeds $256 billion as part of its pledge to cut the deficit in half in five years.\""This is the first test for the Congress when it comes to spending restraint,"" White House spokesman Scott McClellan says.\Brian Walsh, spokesperson for Ney, said since the House version was less money -- $284 billion compared to $318 billion -- the congressman is hopeful that the money for the 18th Congressional District will be included in the final version.\Larry Merry, Zanesville-Muskingum County Port Authority executive director, said it was Ney's work within the House which has set up Muskingum County to work on some important projects with the money.\One of those projects is the Ohio 93/U.S. 40 connector road, which Merry has been working on for a couple of years. ""These highway projects become more important each every day,"" he said.\Like the Ohio 146 project, this one is designed to provide for a safer driving environment. By connecting the two roads, Merry said it will alleviate the traffic load on the other county roads people are currently using to get between the two roads. The project calls for a new roadway from the Ohio 93/U.S. 22 corridor on the south end of Zanesville, to the U.S. 40 corridor near Rehl Road. Construction is not expected until 2007.\""What NorthPointe Road did for the north side of town, this project would do for the southern part,"" Merry said.\Mark McClanan, ZBus general manager, said he will just wait and see what money comes from the federal government, before decisions are made as to the scope of the sign and shelter project.\The project would put more signs up along the bus routes and shelter areas for passengers.\""We want our passengers to have a safe place out of the whether to wait, and it will also help our drivers know whether a person is merely walking along the road or trying to wave down a bus,"" he said.\The project will help cut down on any confusion the public may have about the routes by posting signs. McClanan said they were initially ""looking big"" when it came to the project, but not knowing how much money ZBus will receive decisions will be postponed until written notification is received.\tshipley@nncogannett.com\450-67676"
209,"
COLUMBUS -- Gov. John Kasich urged support from the state's agriculture community Friday for his proposal to increase taxes on fracked oil and gas while decreasing income tax rates for other Ohioans.
\
The governor, backed by the current director of agriculture and a former longtime director of that office, said he was ""disappointed"" the state's largest farm-related group has not endorsed his proposal.
\
""I'm told that there's growing support on the board of the Farm Bureau,"" Kasich told reporters during a press conference in his ceremonial office at the Statehouse. ""... It isn't right that a farmer, you know, theoretically could be paying more taxes then Exxon Mobil in Ohio and taking the low taxes out and giving it to their shareholders who live in Switzerland....""
\
He added, ""When people realize what this plan is, which is out-of-state oil companies pay more and all Ohioans pay less and it improves our business environment, that's a fantastic story. And that's why I know this is ultimately going to become law.""
\
But a Farm Bureau spokesman said the organization has not yet taken a stance on the severance tax plan, and it wasn't clear that the members would opt to adopt a policy position anytime soon. The group solidifies such stances during its annual meeting in December.
\
""We're studying it,"" said Joe Cornely, noting discussions among members are ongoing. ""We have heard from the governor. We've heard from representatives of the oil and gas industry. We have a pretty good understanding of where both of them stand. ... Whether or not we actually put it into the official policy process, that will largely depend on what the members tell us they want.""
\
The governor for months has been seeking lawmaker support to increase in tax rates on oil and gas produced through fracking, an emerging means of extracting fuels from deep underground shale formations by pumping in large volumes of water, chemicals and sand.
\
The industry is expected to add billions of dollars into the state economy in years to come, and Kasich wants to increase severance taxes on fracking production and use the proceeds to implement a corresponding decrease in the state's income tax rates.
\
The governor has said the changes are needed to ensure some economic benefit for Ohio from big profits expected by out-of-state energy companies.
\
""It's fair to industry, it's fair to everybody in Ohio that pays taxes ...,"" said Fred Dailey, who served as the director of the Ohio Department of Agriculture for 16 years and endorsed Kasich's tax proposal Friday. ""Farmers are going to benefit from it -- not just the farmers in eastern Ohio, but farmers all over the state of Ohio are going to benefit from it.""
\
He added, ""Once this is passed, most of those out-of-state companies will still be paying less severance tax in Ohio than they will in their home states.""
\
But some Republicans in the Ohio House are questioning the plan. They pulled related sections from a larger budget bill, saying they would consider them in separate legislation at a later date. They recessed for the summer without acting on the proposal and likely won't pick it up again until after the November election, at the earliest.
\
Statehouse Democrats favor upping the oil and gas tax rates, but they want the resulting collections to be used to help local governments and school districts.
\
""Ohio has one of the lowest severance tax rates in the country so reviewing those rates only makes sense as large oil and gas companies attempt to capitalize on Ohio's natural resources,"" House Minority Leader Armond Budish said in a released statement. ""On this, I agree with Gov. Kasich and frankly I can't understand why House Republicans have stood in the way.""
\
He added, ""... We should determine a fair frack tax rate, but we shouldn't shortchange our schools and local communities along the way.""
\
Industry representatives oppose the plan, saying a tax hike could stifle growth and hurt farmers and other landowners.
\
""When the governor discusses a severance tax increase, he often paints a picture of it applying only to big, out-of-state companies that appear to be cashing in on Ohio's mineral riches,"" Thomas E. Stewart, executive vice president of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, said in a released statement. ""In fact, hundreds of homegrown Ohio-based energy producers and hundreds of thousands of Ohio landowners, in most cases farmers in economically depressed areas, will be burdened with a huge tax bill if the governor's proposal comes to fruition.""

210,"Ohio Senate Republicans are offering an 8% across-the-board income-tax cut over two years while restoring many of the reductions the House made in a $1.2 billion annual tax cut for business owners. \Senate President Larry Obhof, R-Medina, was joined by his caucus members Tuesday in unveiling the chamber’s rewrite of the two-year, $68.8 billion state operating budget passed by the House. \Obhof said the Senate’s proposed budget affords $300 million in annual tax cuts for Ohioans while making needed investments to benefit the environment, education and struggling families. \Foremost among the changes is a coming showdown with the House over taxation — particularly over business taxes — in the budget, now known as Substitute House Bill 166. \The House proposal would erase the state’s bottom two tax brackets on income below $22,500 a year, award a 6.6% income tax cut to all other brackets and reduce the top income-tax rate from 5% to 4.67% on income above $222,200. \The GOP-led chamber also would significantly scale back the current business income-tax deduction that allows partnerships, LLCs and sole proprietors to pay no income tax on up to $250,000 in income, plus get a 40% tax cut on income over $250,000. The House budget would eliminate the extra tax break for Ohio’s wealthiest business filers above $250,000 and lower the new no-tax level to $100,000. \With business groups and Republican Gov. Mike DeWine calling for restoration of the full tax break, the Senate kept much of it. \Senate Finance Committee Chairman Matt Dolan, R-Chagrin Falls, said the business tax break, with the House changes scheduled to be retroactive to the beginning of the year, would remain unchanged this year. \In 2020, the Senate plan would eliminate the extra tax break on annual business owner incomes above $250,000, with filers paying the full 4.6% rate on income in excess of that amount. The change would cut the break by a total of $300 million. Dolan said the tax break creates jobs and dismissed suggestions it is a “loophole.” \House Speaker Larry Householder, R-Glenford, and others have expressed doubts about the tax break generating more jobs and investment and suggested that it largely went to the bottom lines of business owners. \Obhof said he hoped the 8% income-tax cut — 4% annually for two years — would offset the 10.5-cents a gallon increase in the state gas tax Ohioans will pay beginning July 1 to raise more money to fix deteriorated state and local roads. The Senate cut would save a single taxpayer with $45,000 in annual taxable income roughly $67, while the larger Senate cut would increase the savings to about $81. \In reversing the House, the Senate also would keep state tax breaks for movie and TV productions and on purchases of rare coins and bullion. \The proposed budget retains moves made by the House and DeWine to route more state assistance to children and adults afflicted by the state’s opioid crisis and, at $170 million, fully funds the first two years of DeWine’s H2Ohio initiative to help clean algae-fouled Lake Erie and other state waterways. \Under the House plan, beyond the first two years funded at half of the governor’s request, borrowing would be used to create a long-term funding source for H2Ohio, which the Senate rejected. DeWine wanted nearly $900 milllion set aside up front to avoid borrowing. \The Senate also agreed with DeWine’s request, which was approved by the House, to raise the legal age for purchasing all tobacco and vaping products to 21 from 18. \Amid legal challenges over the “heartbeat” law to forbid abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected around six weeks of pregnancy, the substitute bill also proposes $5 million for the Ohio Parenting and Pregnancy Program, which provides funding for pregnancy resource centers around the state. Such centers provide pregnant women with resources designed as an alternative to abortion. \Stephanie Krider, vice president and executive director of Ohio Right to Life, championed the funding as a victory for abortion opponents. “This funding will impact countless mothers and babies by increasing the effectiveness and reach of Ohio’s 140-plus pregnancy resource centers,” she said. \NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio Executive Director Kellie Copeland decried the funds and called for funds to be allocated to reduce infant mortality. “For years, this legislature has been prioritizing bills based on fake science, and now they are continuing this trend by greatly increasing the funds distributed to fake women’s health centers,” she said. \In other moves, the Senate proposed restoring a $15 million federal set-aside to help provide assistance to family members who take children into their care, often because a parent is addicted to opioids or other drugs. \In a statement, Senate Democrats saw some encouragement in the Senate budget proposal, but cast a wary eye on continuing tax cuts. “After the last administration’s decade of cuts, I remain encouraged by the potential reinvestment we could see in this bill. The devil is in the details, but we are hopeful for progress aimed at improving the quality of life of all Ohioans,” said Minority Leader Kenn Yuko, D-Richmond Heights. \Dispatch reporter Ben Deeter contributed to this story. \rludlow@dispatch.com \@RandyLudlow \CREDIT: RANDY LUDLOW"
211,"Recent editorials of statewide and national interest from Ohio and Kentucky newspapers.\The Columbus Dispatch, Dec. 22\For Gov. Mike DeWine, 2019 has been the first year of the culmination of a life in public service, and Ohio is better for it.\DeWine was not our choice in the 2018 gubernatorial race. We preferred Democrat Richard Cordray, both for his own long record of public service and out of concern that DeWine would do too little to counter the backward tendencies of a General Assembly dominated by his fellow Republicans.\His tenure so far has been a welcome surprise.\From a much-needed gas-tax hike to spending on children's needs to environmental protection, DeWine has focused on problems that the Republican legislature over the years largely has yawned at. In some cases, he has done so against opposition from others in his party.\Working with a supermajority of conservative Republicans, many of them to the right of rightwing, parts of DeWine's agenda are only slightly more popular than a Democrat's with some members of his party. Yet he has been resolute in pursuing it, and part of the reason seems clear: Unlike most of his predecessors, Mike DeWine can do what he really wants.\The 72-year-old governor won't be running for any further public office other than reelection, and that's a different prospect from seeking the presidency or a Senate seat. DeWine doesn't have to worry about alienating President Donald Trump's hard-right supporters or collecting chits from Statehouse politicians with their own ideological agendas. ...\Those who know DeWine say it's easy to see what helps him find the possible in Ohio's contentious political environment: boundless energy and a genuinely likeable personality.\Where Kasich quarreled with lawmakers, they say, DeWine hosts lunches and picnics and listens. Local government officials, including the County Commissioners Association of Ohio, marvel that he shows up at their meetings and new-courthouse openings and listens to their concerns.\""He obviously loves being governor,"" one friend said. ""He enjoys the people.""\We thank Gov. DeWine for his hard work and we look forward to at least three more years of progress on behalf of all Ohioans.\The Toledo Blade, Dec. 22\The Republicans started this.\It was the Republicans who defined impeachment down. No longer would it be a matter of grave seriousness for the nation. No, it would be political. And it would be personal.\The Republicans hated Bill Clinton and could not accept him as the president. And so impeachment, which Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution says shall be ""for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" became, not a constitutional remedy but a weapon of raw, and ongoing, power politics.\It is not unreasonable to assume that, if President Donald Trump is reelected, he will be impeached again. It is not unreasonable to assume that the next Democratic president who faces a Republican House will be impeached.\This House impeached this president, not for treason or bribery or high crimes, but for obstruction of Congress and abuse of power. This lowers the standard for impeachment. This is a standard that could be applied to every president since Theodore Roosevelt.\And this is indisputably unwise.\One can search the Federalist Papers and the records of the Constitutional Convention for clear intent in the minds of the Founders on impeachment. One will search in vain.\What is clear, with apologies to those on the originalist spectrum, is that the Founders gave us the structure of a political system and expected us to make it work, in different ways, in real time and through time. And throughout American history, impeachment has been regarded as what we today would call ""the nuclear option.""\Up until Richard Nixon, who was about to be impeached by the House before he resigned, impeachment had been invoked only once in almost two centuries. In the Nixon case, two sound principles were established: First, that impeachment would have to have some bipartisan support to move forward, and second, that it should be established that a crime was committed. We have now seen impeachment invoked twice in roughly 20 years. And in neither case was there support from the party of the president. In neither case was a ""high crime"" proven.\A majority of Americans might easily agree that Donald Trump violated norms and decency, and sound policymaking, in playing hardball with the government of Ukraine, hoping to damage a political foe. But that rises to the level of impeachment only if impeachment is no longer nuclear but just one more weapon of political warfare.\By applying such a potent weapon to political conflict, we have plunged ourselves into a state of permanent political warfare – an endless politics of payback with no interruption for governing.\And this, in turn, means a politics of permanent division, with no bridges and no bridge builders. ...\The Frankfort State Journal, Dec. 19\Though not what she expected, Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman's quick ascent in Kentucky politics while visibly pregnant and simultaneously juggling a family has struck a familiar chord with many across the state – ourselves included.\A former high school girls basketball coach and mother, Coleman certainly doesn't fit the mold of a hardened politician, but perhaps that is what makes her so relatable. Already a ""bonus"" mom to husband and Frankfort High School boys basketball coach Chris O'Bryan's two sons, Will and Nate, the family's adoption of daughter, Emma Young, (became) official recently, and the newest family member, Evelynne, is due in February.\In fact, when she announced her pregnancy via Twitter in August, Coleman wrote, ""Most of the blessings in my life have been completely unexpected.""\We agree. Whether anticipated or not, the new lieutenant governor has been thrust into a leadership role and is an inspiring example for all Kentucky women, but especially those of the younger generation. She is proof that women can hold prominent positions while being a mother and raising a family.\While Coleman readily admits there is ""no playbook"" for the future, she does hope more mothers take on leadership positions.\""We certainly need more moms – women certainly, but also moms – helping to shape public police because it affects our kids,"" she told a State Journal reporter last week.\But the road to the Capitol wasn't lined with roses for Coleman either. In 2014, she lost an election for a House seat that her father, Jack Coleman, held to Republican Rep. Kim King.\But she didn't take the defeat personally and got back on the proverbial horse, perhaps taking a piece of advice from former fellow coach John Wooden, who said, ""Things turn out best for the people who make the best of the way things turn out."""
212,"LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS 2002 VOTERS GUIDE ELECTION 2002\ * Duties: The governor sees that all state laws are faithfully executed, communicates the conditions of the state and recommends measures to the Legislature at each session, and issues all grants and commissions. The supreme executive power is vested in the office of the governor. The governor serves as one of the five members of the Apportionment Board, which establishes the district boundaries for the Ohio House and Senate. The lieutenant governor succeeds to the office of governor in the event of the death, impeachment, resignation or removal from office of the governor, and carries out other executive duties assigned by the governor or by law. The governor and lieutenant governor are elected in tandem.\ * Question for governor candidates: How would you maximize use of federal funds to benefit Ohioans?\ * Term: 4 years\ * denotes incumbent\ John A. Eastman (I)\ CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR\ * Education: Ph.D., 1977, University of Washington, Environmental Engineering; M.S.E., 1972, Johns Hopkins University, Environmental Engineering; B.S., 1970, Antioch College.\ * Occupation: Chief Environmental Engineer, LJB Inc., Dayton, Ohio.\ * Question for lieutenant governor candidates: How do you plan to help the governor resolve the school funding issue?\ * Training and experience: 30 years professional experience. Clerk of Quaker meeting. Past candidate: State senate, lieutanant governor, U.S. Senate. Steering Committee Greene County Environment 2000. DACC Environmental Committee.\ * Answer: Federal funds originate from taxes paid by Ohio residents so we must ensure that Ohio receives all funding for which we are eligible. Federal funds generally come earmarked for specific purposes. For maximum utilization of these funds, we must minimize bureaucratic and administrative waste and distribute resources where they are most needed without political favoritism. Wherever possible, discretionary funds should be used as seed money to empower local communities in partnership with local business to solve problems within their communities, and to revitalize local communities so they can tackle issues for themselves.\ Sadie Marie Moore Stewart (NL)\ CANDIDATE FOR LT.

One example is the state prison system. The root causes of crime have already been identified by numerous commissions and other social/academic studies. Yet most of the state budget is spent incarcerating criminals.

Ohio ranks 34th in its share of federal funds - in short, we ship more money to the federal treasury than we get back. We will also guarantee affordable training opportunities for all workers seeking to upgrade their education and skill level by drawing down all available federal Workforce Investment Act (WIA) funds.

Work to bring the Ohio budget crisis under control, talking with Ohio's citizens to explain the problems and the possible solutions. Without a balanced and fiscally accountable budget, nothing else we would like to accomplish will be possible.

When the $2.6 billion Brent Spence Bridge replacement suffered two major setbacks in Frankfort last week, supporters of the project were troubled, its opponents cheered, and outside observers wondered, ""What the heck is going on in Kentucky?""
\
To some in the region, the path forward seems obvious: The bridge is outdated, overcrowded and unsafe, and it needs to be replaced as soon as possible. Federal transportation officials and members of Congress have said they won't foot the entire bill, so the region has to pick up some of the tab in the form of tolls.
\
But the issue seems equally clear to others: The bridge carries an interstate critical to national commerce, and drivers already pay federal gas tax, so Congress should be forced to replace it - and we can afford to wait until they do.
\
It's a wide gap, and the divide runs deeper in Northern Kentucky than in any other part of Greater Cincinnati. But the reality is that the project is unlikely to move forward without some common ground.
\
When Kentucky's House of Representatives yanked $37 million in state money and allowed a ban on Brent Spence tolls to pass the chamber last week, legislative leaders were essentially telling Northern Kentucky, ""You need to figure this out, and then get back to us.""
\
""One of the ways you judge a region is its ability to develop and execute strategies on behalf of its future. And we're just not demonstrating our ability to get behind a strategy and work it in the competitive environment of Frankfort,"" said Jim Votruba, chairman of the Northern Kentucky CEO Roundtable, which came out in support of tolls for the project last month.
\
But why is the region so divided? And how can those divisions be bridged?
\
There is no easy answer.
\
For the past 15 years, the Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce has advocated for the project in Washington, D.C., Frankfort and within the region, making the case that replacing the now 50-year-old span is a critical priority. For more than a decade, nobody really disagreed with that premise. Then, two years ago, tolls came into the equation.
\
More than 150 Greater Cincinnati companies formed a coalition in mid-2012 called Build Our New Bridge Now to advance the project. The group publicly raised the possibility of tolls - or, euphemistically, ""user fees"" - for the first time.
\
Some advocates of the project now privately concede that may have been a miscalculation: pushing for tolls so early in the process allowed opposition to emerge and coalesce.
\
By the time Ohio and Kentucky transportation officials issued a preliminary financial plan in December 2013 that officially recommended tolls, opposition was already strong. Never mind that the governors of Ohio and Kentucky have repeatedly said the project will not happen without tolls - many in the region had already made up their minds.
\
The Northern Kentucky Tea Party has been the loudest voice against tolls, mobilizing its members and working to convince others to oppose tolls. Local lawmakers say their offices in Frankfort are flooded with messages to that effect.
\
""So much of the debate over the bridge and over tolls is a debate over the role of government, the size of government and what government should do,"" Votruba said. ""I think our legislators have a difficult time charting a course among these various political interest groups, and it makes it difficult.""
\
Northern Kentucky is also a politically-fractured community with no clear leader. With more than three dozen cities spread across three counties, no one person or group speaks for the entire region - so nobody has been able to steer the debate over the Brent Spence Bridge in a more constructive direction.
\
A growing number of cities - at least 10 - have passed anti-toll resolutions since 2012, along with both Boone and Kenton counties. Fort Mitchell Mayor Chris Wiest has led the charge to convince cities up and down Interstate 75 to sign on to the resolutions. Some, like Covington, are concerned tolls will divert a large amount of local traffic through their communities.
\
""This is not a business-versus-tea-party issue. I think this is a big-business-versus-community sentiment,"" Wiest said. ""You have a number of jurisdictions in Northern Kentucky that have passed resolutions against tolls. This is a community that does not want tolls, adamantly.""
\
For Wiest and many others, the issue is one of fairness: We pay federal gas taxes, so why should we pay tolls for a federal interstate bridge? Federal officials have said the money is simply not there, but toll opponents disagree.
\
""As soon as you accept that as an answer, you give the federal government a free pass on it,"" Wiest said. ""I do not understand how we can be sending billions of dollars to Ukraine in foreign aid and not find this money for an interstate bridge. I don't get it.
\
""It is incredible to me: We've got the Senate Minority Leader from Kentucky and we've got the Speaker of the House from Ohio, and we cannot seem to get this bridge built?""
\
The divide between supporters and opponents continues to grow.
\
Advocates for the project hope to buy some time to bridge that divide by convincing the state Senate to restore the $37 million needed to keep the project moving forward toward construction. Senate Majority Floor Leader Damon Thayer, R-Georgetown, said Saturday that he is working to restore those planning funds, although he believes the federal government needs to pay for construction.
\
The $2.6 billion cost includes a new span over the Ohio River and the reconfiguration of a 7.8-mile stretch of I-75. About $100 million has already been spent on planning and design work. The project needs $60 million to keep it from stalling; it's currently slated to receive $23 million earmarked years ago by former U.S. Rep. Geoff Davis of Hebron.
\
If the General Assembly restores the other $37 million, the next challenge is getting both sides to come to the table and find some common ground.
\
""We need to have a fact-based, truth-based conversation on policy, not one simply driven by emotion,"" said Davis, who helped earmark $50 million for the project during seven years in Washington. Today, Davis owns a consulting firm that is lobbying for the project in Washington, D.C.
\
Chamber leaders are trying to get that conversation started. For several weeks, they've been meeting with toll opponents and trying to find some common ground somewhere. They're also trying to dispel myths surrounding the project: There are no plans for $6.50 tolls, as the tea party's website claims.
\
It's unclear whether that's working; Wiest believes toll advocates should come around to opponents' way of thinking and apply more pressure on Congress.
\
In the end, the local lawmakers who oppose tolls are only doing ""what the average citizen wants,"" said Brent Cooper, the chamber of commerce's interim president. ""But I don't think the average citizen realizes what they're saying: No tolling at all means no bridge.
\
""What we're saying to people is, 'What if the toll is 50 cents? Are you still against it? What if there were no tolls at all between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.?'"" Cooper said. ""Just saying no is not a way to work through this problem. That's what we've been trying to explain to people. Right now, just saying no is getting us absolutely nowhere.""

To respond to the letter ""Protestors shouldn't forget to thank a vet,"" (Feb. 19), thank you for your service to this country. And thank you to all who serve or have served in the United States Armed Forces.
\
I know it is probably painful for you all to watch the citizens you have defended protest now against military action in Iraq. But take a moment to remember that when you swore to protect this country and its people, you were also swearing to protect all of its values and freedoms. Freedom of speech and the freedom to demonstrate peacefully are part of the foundation upon which our country was built.

Don't condemn Americans for exercising the rights that you fought so hard to keep safe for them.

Krings' cushy deal will always taint him

At some point, David Krings may be interviewing for another job. So, what employer would want to touch this tainted past?

New anti-hate law is welcome message
\
I am writing to thank Cincinnati City Council members who voted to add sexual orientation and disability to the pre-existing hate crimes ordinance. Some call this new measure ""symbolic."" Some call it placing one category of persons above another. Not I.
\
I call it ""sending a message."" In these times of impending war, terrorism and racial unrest in our own back yard, I think this measure sends a message to those who would single out folks for abuse, battery and cruelty because they're seen as different.
\
For those who disagree, consider this: What if your son, daughter or loved one was targeted for abuse for being perceived as different? For example, what if your son was beaten repeatedly on the playground and called ""faggot""? That happened to me then and it still does now. I was grabbed, beaten and robbed in this city and called ""faggot"" 30 times. And this wasn't in grade school this time. It was this month, the third time this year.
\
I don't know why I'm targeted. I just know that it's morally wrong, mean, and downright evil to single someone out for abuse because you're afraid, you need to feel macho, etc.
\
We all have a right to our own religious and moral beliefs, but not one of us has the right to abuse another. Thanks, City Council, for sending out this message. As for any potential hatemongers out there, I hope you get this message. Your disgusting acts of ""macho aggression"" are no longer tolerated.

Broad brush stains Amelia High teachers
\
In the editorial and related articles concerning the Amelia High School staff and their supposed responsibilities in the recent incidents at the school, you use a broad brush in staining the reputations of the vast majority of teachers in the school.
\
It is not unusual for many teachers to work an entire year in this large school with little or no contact with other staff members. Most teachers actually had no knowledge of these activities. Others who might have heard rumors did not give them credence because they had no facts or evidence. If this extensive activity should have certainly been noticed by someone, then how could administrators, students, or even parents have no knowledge of this behavior. The accusation that there was some sort of ""code of silence"" is without merit.
\
The faculty and staff at Amelia High School continue to work hard with a tremendous group of young people, and together they are striving to build a better school community. The teachers are committed to maintaining a safe environment for the students. Misinformation from sources not directly involved in the school has made a very bad situation worse.

What about diversity in major sports?
\
Regarding local and national companies defending the policies and practices of the University of Michigan's racial preferences for diversity:
\
My only question would be: Were all these racial diversity policies and practices in the top three professional sports - baseball, basketball and football? Whereas in these aforementioned three areas the true American spirit thrives: The best people get to play and earn their millions no matter what their race, national origin or whatever else that diversity does not allow to happen.

Stress on diversity can harm a school
\
In response to the letter ""Diverse students teach each other"" (Feb. 19), the letter writer needs to realize that students with good high school grade point averages and SAT scores are being turned down so that the University of Michigan can make their campus ""diverse.""
\
Diversity is highly overrated.
\
I attended Walnut Hills High School, which has an extremely diverse student body. This diversity was good, sometimes. The school almost placed too much emphasis on their claim to diversity, straying from its reputation of academic excellence.
\
The University of Michigan is doing the same thing. It is accepting students based upon their race before they accept a student with a good academic record. I thought that people of the minority wished they were treated equal. It seems a shame that they are getting preferential treatment over students who really deserve the spot.
\
How can a school give a minority 20 points toward admission when a perfect score on the SAT is worth only 12?

Let's judge by performance, not race
\
When will the equality begin? Kudos to President Bush for recognizing the fact that by awarding extra points to a student's admissions form because they are African-American, the University of Michigan is discriminating against white students. The reverse discrimination in this country is getting worse every day.
\
Equality means no preferential treatment in that both sides are the same. What's next? No taxes if employed? Extra votes if running for office? Let the equality begin for all. Let all men and women be judged on who they are and how they perform regardless of their race, religious preference or nationality.

Government gouging us with gas taxes
\
Gasoline is pushing $2 a gallon all over the country. Sure it's expensive, and it's very easy to attack the oil companies as gouging us during a national crisis. I'd like to point out one bit of this equation that conveniently gets passed over: the gas tax. How much would the price of a gallon of gas fall if the federal and state tax was removed - 50 cents, 75 cents?
\
We'll never know, of course, because as soon as it's proposed some bureaucrat in Columbus or Washington will start shrieking about the highways falling apart , etc., ad nauseum. The gas companies have a right as capitalists to make a profit. The state, however, does not have a right to oppress its citizens in tough economic times and especially in time of war.
\
Removing the tax on fuel is not only the right thing for Washington and Columbus to do - it's their obligation, and it is our right to demand it.

A massive repair bill confronts the nation to fix our roads and bridges
\
Local roads, bridges, railroads, bike trails and mass transit need more than $7 billion worth of upgrades in the next 20 years.
\
Almost half the regional total - or $3.2 billion - will buy a replacement for the Brent Spence Bridge, a chronically congested but critical link in the nationwide highway network because it carries Interstates 71 and 75 across the Ohio River. It's due for replacement in 2015, although nobody is sure where all the money will come from.
\
Similar needs are commonplace across the country. Louisville, for example, needs three new Ohio River bridges.
\
The major source of federal road money is the Highway Trust Fund. Congress voted last week to shift $8 billion into the fund, days after Transportation Secretary Mary Peters warned the fund would be broke by the end of the month. Even with the emergency infusion, the fund faces bankruptcy in 2009 unless Congress votes for to re-authorize it and find new revenue for it.
\
State highway funds, primarily based on gasoline and other fuel taxes, also aren't growing as people drive less or use more efficient vehicles. Meanwhile, highway construction costs keep rising faster than inflation, shrinking the buying power of the feds and states.
\
As a result, the national gap between money needed to fix aging roads and bridges and money on hand is enormous - and growing.
\
Failure to maintain and repair the nation's road isn't just causing concern about the safety of drivers or about the time and money lost - and pollution caused - by traffic congestion. It's becoming an economic problem, too.
\
In some parts of Ohio, lack of good roads is ""already affecting the ability to get good jobs and expand"" businesses, said U.S. Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
\
How to pay for transportation and other infrastructure is a question that the new administration - whoever wins the presidency - and the new Congress will face from their first day in office.
\
Because the trust fund is on life support, ""unlike many other issues that Congress will deal with over the coming year, action appears inevitable."" wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Alec Phillips in a June 30 report.
\
Bold proposals for closing the funding gap are already emerging. Among them:
\
Tax hikes. Advocates say raising the 18.4-cents-a-gallon federal gas tax, unchanged since 1993, could re-energize vital infrastructure and by extension, the economy. Opponents say it would cause inflation and destroy jobs.
\
Infrastructure bank. Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama supports a financing high-priced projects by selling government-backed bonds.
\
Merit-based choices. Republican candidate John McCain wants to ban congressional earmarks, which provide money to projects without standard analysis of need and value. Instead, he wants to set priorities based on systematic reviews.
\
Public-private partnerships. The Bush administration has been a strong proponent of agreements that allow private concerns to collect tolls in return for building, operating and maintaining public facilities. Indiana collected more than $3 billion after it recently turned its toll roads over to a private contractor.
\
Streamlining. The planning process required for federally funded projects is universally condemned as onerous, exhausting, inefficient and expensive.
\
Among the advocates for collapsing the process is Mark Policinski, executive director of the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana Regional Council of Governments. Policinski, whose agency came up with the $7 billion local list of needed projects as part of report to federal authorities, believes faster planning could save so much money that a tax hike would be unneeded.
\
Funding gap
\
The size of the nation's transportation funding gap is a matter of debate.
\
The National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission, which Congress authorized to study the problem in 2005, earlier this year estimated it will cost $225 billion every year for 50 years to meet all the nation's needs.
\
The American Society of Civil Engineers puts the cost of repairing and upgrading existing structures - including water, flood control and other systems - at $320 billion a year for five years.
\
Meanwhile, the major federal transportation bill, known as among Washington's policy wonks as SAFETEA-LU, provides $48 billion a year.
\
Most of the money in the federal Highway Trust Fund comes from gas taxes, which have been falling in recent years as vehicles become more fuel-efficient. In 2007, tax receipts are down even more sharply because high gas prices and a weak economy have kept drivers and their vehicles off the road.
\
Congress this summer ran into a stalemate over an emergency $8 billion infusion to keep the trust fund from going bankrupt next year. Democrats wanted the $8 billion to come out of general funds; Republicans wanted to take it from mass transit funds.
\
Lawmakers will face much tougher conflicts when they tackle the bill that authorizes the trust fund; it will expire on Sept. 30, 2009.
\
Washington typically puts up about 45 percent of road and bridge construction costs; the rest comes from states, local governments and private interests, such as toll road operators.
\
But states are not in a position to pick up that share, much less the slack in what Washington isn't providing. Economic weakness is battering their revenues, while costs are exploding.
\
How will we pay?
\
Kentucky estimates its road plans are underfunded by $1.8 billion. Ohio could be as much as $3.5 billion short, thanks in part to what Ohio Transportation Secretary James Beasley called ""devastating"" inflation in the price of construction materials.
\
Where all the money for transportation will come from is a question being asked with increasing frequency across the nation. Governors, mayors, builders and engineers have been calling for decisive action - and fast.
\
""As a country, it's embarrassing when we have bridges falling in Minnesota and pipelines bursting in New York,"" said Robert T. Greenbaum, associate director of the Center for Urban and Regional Analysis at Ohio State University.
\
Greenbaum stressed a need for action ""because keeping up the infrastructure affects the location of economic activity.""
\
Voinovich, a member of the Senate subcommittee that will shape the new highway funding bill, has been urging his fellow lawmakers to buckle down and find new sources of revenue.
\
""We need to face up to our infrastructure needs or we're going to put ourselves in a position were not going to be as competitive as we need to be,"" he said.

Taking the toll
\
Earlier this year, when the Kentucky Legislature briefly considered a bill that would have allowed tolls on the new Brent Spence Bridge, local reaction was fast, furious and adamantly opposed. Much of it focused on the inconvenience of stopping at booths to drop coins in a basket.
\
That outdated image is being supplanted by electronic tolling systems that allow traffic to flow continually without slowing or stopping - advanced versions of electronic passes already used on most toll roads.
\
By the time the new bridge is finished decade or so from now, so-called ""open road tolling"" is likely to be the technology of choice.
\
If the new Brent Spence were to be a toll bridge, traffic would pass under scanners mounted over and beside the highway. Monitors would read a code on radio chips that would identify each vehicle and automatically charge a toll account.
\
License plates on vehicles without chips would be photographed, and bills mailed to the owners, who would pay an extra fee. Charges potentially could be tied to vehicle registrations.
\
Chips could be purchased like license tags., or could be factory installed and eventually programmed to auto-pay other charges, from gas to fast food.
\
Local residents could avoid heavy toll charges by paying a nominal yearly fee, perhaps $5 to $10, said Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana Regional Council of Governments Executive Director Mark Policinski.
\
Tolls may yet re-emerge as a funding option, if proposals to raise fuel taxes fail

Reconsider the use of old oil wells
\
The only major oil spill resulting from a ruptured pipeline occurred in January, 2000, in Guanabara Bay, Brazil. Iraq intentionally spilled crude oil into the Persian Gulf during the Gulf War in 1991.
\
All other major spills have resulted from collisions, leaks in ships, or ship groundings.
\
Oil-producing installations, drilled, built, and maintained by Americans, are historically and obviously safe and trouble free.
\
I even spoke to a welder who worked on the Alaskan pipeline for two years, and his greatest problem was having to climb onto a high section of the line to avoid being trampled by migrating caribou.
\
Today, the average cost of a gallon of regular in Ohio is over $3.50, with higher costs expected.
\
We buy much of our oil from Venezuela, and its chief, Hugo Chavez, who admits his hatred for the United States; from Mexico, which has sent millions of illegals to this country who get citizens' benefits without being required to earn them as have all immigrants in all past generations; from Nigeria, which is embroiled in a civil war, and from historically unfriendly nations.
\
At the same time, while Cuba openly considers licensing Russia or Japan to drill for oil in the ocean between our countries, we refuse to allow any drilling within miles of our shores, voicing unwarranted concerns over our environment.
\
Within our shores are hundreds of old, abandoned wells which, with modern fractionating methods, could again produce needed petroleum.
\
It is time that we reconsider our position.

High gas prices revise vacations
\
I have just revised my plans for the summer. I will not be traveling to North Carolina to visit my sister as I had planned since last year. Also, she will not be visiting here this year.
\
Gasoline prices have become so out of sight as to be a joke. The oil companies have posted billions of dollars in profit for the last several quarters, and yet have the nerve to insist they are not ""gouging.""
\
One excuse is that they don't have enough refinery capacity.
\
Well, with all that profit why don't they build new refineries? Guess not. That would make too much sense, wouldn't it?
\
And as if this isn't ridiculous enough, the government agrees with them.
\
At the very least, there should be a congressional investigation. After all, it's simply not possible that every single senator and congressman is in the oil business like our (so-called) President.
\
The man is a disgrace and should be impeached for the rape of the American people. Thank God he can't run again.

Petroleum industry takes it on the chin
\
For years gas prices go up just before a holiday weekend and drop back down after, and the news media try to explain why.
\
There can be four gas stations on any given street corner and they all raise their prices at exactly the same time and exactly the same price. Then they go down at exactly the same time to exactly the same price. That used to be called ""price fixing"".
\
In these times of highly competitive competition, industry has to spend millions of dollars on research to stay competitive. They say we don't have enough capacity to keep up with the gas demand in this country.
\
Do you suppose the petroleum industry has had its head in the sand and that is why a refinery has not been built in this country for the last 25 or 30 years, or do you suppose things have gone exactly like the oil people in this country have wanted it to go.
\
The oil companies in this country control, to a great extent, our economy. Motels and resorts and everyone will suffer monetarily for the vacations and trips cancelled this summer because of gasoline prices. They will get the gas price up to $4 so when they drop it to $3.50 we will be happy.
\
Lord knows the petroleum industry has really taken it on the chin. Their profits show exactly how they have taken it on the chin.

Consumer controls stretch of fuel dollar
\
It's quite obvious that the rise in gasoline prices has yet to affect any of the Toledo drivers. On my way into work every morning, I still see everybody zooming down the expressway at speeds of 70 mph-plus putting on makeup, talking on phones, eating breakfast, etc.
\
Until people realize that they are in total control of how much they spend on gas, the pain in the wallet will not subside. Optimum fuel efficiency is well below the posted speed limits on our highways. However, the more drivers slow down closer to the posted speeds or even slightly below, I don't want to hear that the price of gas is ridiculous.
\
It is out of control, but the consumer has total control as to how to stretch the fuel dollar.

'Don't kill goose that lays gold egg'
\
There is an axiom in business: ""Don't kill the goose that lays the golden egg.""
\
The oil companies are now telling us the cost of gasoline has risen to $4 a gallon as their refineries are operating at less than full capacity due to breakdowns and some are operating less than 50 percent of capacity.
\
The operating inefficiencies of the refineries have caused a shortage in the supply of gasoline at the neighborhood pumps. So the oil companies tell us. Another axiom, this time in statistics: ""Shortage-of-supply prices rise. Excess-supply prices fall.""
\
The oil companies have been telling us for several months various reasons why there is a shortage of gasoline.
\
I'm surprised they haven't told us the geologists have been suffering from various maladies, which has affected their performance in seeking new oil fields.
\
I hold that refineries are the geese that lay the golden eggs. If the oil companies are that stupid not to recognize this in not plowing some of their ""bottom line profits,"" in keeping their refineries operating at full capacity, we are doomed at the pump.
\
Or are we that stupid in accepting the oil firms' smoke screens and not pressuring our elected congressmen to tell us the secrets they know about the oil companies they are keeping from us. We have a right for quick and positive legislation action.

Excess profits tax merits a comeback

If Congress would re-enact the excess profits tax that was in effect in the 1940s and early 1950s and divert the money to road repairs, it would help the American people recoup some of the profits from the gouging oil companies.

Why not invest here? Why not make new, fuel-efficient four cylinder engines? They're closing plants, laying off employees, closing dealerships, and getting ready to be owned by a USA corporation - yet they'll spend millions outside the USA as part of their ""restructuring plan.""

220,"The Trump administration, determined to overhaul and modernize the nation's infrastructure, is drafting plans to privatize some public assets such as airports, bridges, highway rest stops and other facilities, according to top officials and advisers. \In his proposed budget, President Trump called for spending $200 billion over 10 years to ""incentivize"" private, state and local spending on infrastructure. \Trump advisers said that to entice state and local governments to sell some of their assets, the administration is considering paying them a bonus. The proceeds of the sales would then go to other infrastructure projects. Australia has pursued a similar policy, which it calls ""asset recycling,"" prompting the 99-year lease of a state-owned electrical grid to pay for improvements to the Sydney Metro, among other projects. \In the United States, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) explored privatizing Midway International Airport several years ago but dropped the idea in 2013, after a key bidder backed away. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao says such projects should be encouraged. \""You take the proceeds from the airport, from the sale of a government asset, and put it into financing infrastructure,"" Chao said. St. Louis is working with federal officials to try to privatize Lambert International Airport, she said. \Officials are crafting Trump's initiative, and he has yet to decide which ideas will make the final cut. But two driving themes are clear: Government practices are stalling the nation's progress; and private companies should fund, build and run more of the basic infrastructure of American life. \A far-reaching proposal from the Trump administration earlier this year to take the nation's air-traffic control system out of government hands was fueled, in part, by frustration at sluggish efforts to modernize technology. \To speed up infrastructure projects, officials are preparing to overhaul the federal environmental review and permitting system, which they blame for costly delays. Trump asked advisers whether they could collapse that process, which he said takes at least 10 years, down to four months. ""But we'll be satisfied with a year,"" Trump said. ""It won't be more than a year."" \In a bid for broader support, Trump and some of his advisers have also signaled an openness to raising the gas tax to pay for needed projects. The 18.4-cent-per-gallon levy is the federal government's main source of highway funds and was last raised in 1993. \The infrastructure initiative is being shaped by White House officials and a task force representing 16 federal departments and agencies. In addition, there is a committee of outside advisers co-chaired by billionaire developer Richard LeFrak, a Trump friend. \LeFrak said the administration's effort, which is being led by Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, Chao and others, is a sweeping attempt to rethink how infrastructure gets built. LeFrak said the issues are intensely personal for Trump, who spent his career in real estate and sees this as an area where he can make a lasting impact. \""He does think he's the president to rebuild America. He's a builder. It's just logical,"" LeFrak said. ""He's highly enthusiastic about this idea and getting it done."" \Critics said Trump and his advisers are putting ideology ahead of the national interest and oversimplifying how the process works. \Public stewards should not be ""trying to figure out how to extract maximum value"" by selling off government assets or ""making huge, multibillion-dollar wagers"" that span decades, said Kevin De-Good, director of infrastructure policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal advocacy group. ""Building infrastructure faster and without adequate study or time for community input may be good for developers, but it's lousy for everyone else."" \Still, there are bipartisan concerns that important projects have been stymied by politics and bureaucracy, and that Washington has been unwilling to allocate the money for needed improvements. A civil-engineering group in March tallied a ""$2 trillion, 10-year investment gap"" in the nation's roads, transit systems, bridges, water systems, power grids, parks, ports and schools. \In February, Trump told Congress that he would seek legislation ""that produces a $1 trillion investment"" in infrastructure and creates ""millions of new jobs."" Officials have since said that the plan will probably include $200 billion in direct federal funds, which would be used to ""leverage"" the larger figure over a decade. LeFrak sees the chance for a deal, noting that Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) also ""wants a trillion-dollar program."" \But when Trump's budget proposal was released, Schumer condemned the president's ""180-degree turn away from his repeated promise of a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan,"" saying the budget contains deep cuts in spending on roads, transit projects, public housing and more. \""The fuzzy math and sleight of hand can't hide the fact that the President's $200 billion plan is more than wiped out by other cuts to key infrastructure programs,"" Schumer said in a statement. \Trump administration officials disputed Schumer's calculations, saying they included budget items that should not be considered cuts. \At a recent White House event, Trump stood alongside one of his top infrastructure aides, DJ Gribbin, who held up a seven-foot-long flow chart illustrating the highway permitting process. The colorful boxes and baffling array of crisscrossing lines were meant to drive home a point about regulatory overreach. \The chart also could have been a graphic representation of the difficulty of crafting a $1 trillion package capable of making it through Congress at a time beset with political division. \Democrats, including Schumer, and some Republicans favor a heavy reliance on federal spending, while others in the GOP want to cut that spending and push more responsibility onto states. Agreeing on ways to better manage arcane state and federal regulations would be tough in even the most forgiving of climates. \Add in the priorities of numerous government agencies, and the puzzle becomes even more complex. \""This is a democracy,"" Chao said. ""They're not easy questions."" \They also are trying to account for dizzying technological advances. How do you plan for a 10-year broadband expansion, for example, when the technology could easily shift in five years, Chao asked. \LeFrak, who co-chairs the advisory committee with another Trump friend, Vornado Realty Trust Chairman Steven Roth, said they have also been wrestling with another challenge: the controversy over high-speed rail, ""which is one of the things people dream about."" \But he has seen studies showing a much lower per-mile cost for using driverless cars instead. So should the government invest in rail, which takes passengers station to station, or in ""some kind of road network which is going to allow these cars to travel at relatively high speeds"" and take a passenger door to door, he asked. \The administration's focus on shortening the environmental-review process has concerned environmental groups that point to Trump's moves to reverse efforts to fight climate change, including Thursday's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. \Trump's advisers say it's possible to speed up projects that have clear support and a good business case -- while also doing more to protect the environment. But Trump's push for strict new deadlines would require major changes to environmental laws, which would face fierce opposition. \""There's no reason why the U.S. cannot function as efficiently as other Western-style democracies in getting worthy projects through the system and permitted,"" LeFrak said. ""The math speaks for itself. What we're doing in six years, seven years, eight years, 10 years, these other countries get done in a year or two."" \DeGood said Trump's team is relying on exaggerated figures and playing down recent reforms to speed approvals. Administration officials cited a report saying it took the Federal Highway Administration more than six years to approve major environmental reviews for projects that need them. While that was true in 2011, DeGood said, that figure has since dropped to 3.6 years. \Chao said that things still move too slowly and that many permitting processes can be done simultaneously rather than sequentially. Officials will cut ""duplicative or wasteful steps,"" she said. \""If we can make these construction projects come online faster without compromising the environmental concerns, it's good for the quality of life of a community.. . . It helps people. It creates more jobs. It creates less congestion,"" Chao said. And faster approvals create less-risky, more-attractive opportunities to invest in the United States. ""What I heard from the private sector is there's lots of money available, but there are not enough projects."" \The administration plans to push states to use public-private partnerships -- P3s in industry jargon. \In such arrangements, a private firm might bring together investors and low-cost federal loans to expand a highway, for example, then collect tolls from motorists to recoup costs and earn a profit. Companies can more nimbly tap technology and other innovations in building and maintaining such projects, advocates say. Critics say relying on tolls will not work in rural or distressed communities. \Australia, which has long advocated privatization, launched its ""asset recycling initiative"" in 2014. Cohn, a former president of Goldman Sachs, said officials are looking at importing the idea. \""Instead of people in cities and states and municipalities coming to us and saying, 'Please give us money to build a project,' and not knowing if it will get maintained, and not knowing if it will get built, we say, 'Hey, take a project you have right now, sell it off, privatize it, we know it will get maintained, and we'll reward you for privatizing it,' "" Cohn told executives at the White House. ""The bigger the thing you privatize, the more money we'll give you."" \The Australian treasury said the central government has reached agreements to pay out $1.7 billion in ""incentive payments"" that will ""unlock"" $12.6 billion in spending. \All of this still leaves the question: How do you get to $1 trillion? \""Everything's on the table,"" Chao said. \Administration officials are putting together a menu of options to hit that total, including big-ticket possibilities such as ""repatriating"" funds parked overseas by U.S. firms, and smaller ideas such as privatizing highway service plazas, Chao said. \""I've come to the conclusion that the wish of everybody is we have divine intervention, that somehow a bridge gets floated down from on high. People say, 'Wow, we got a free bridge!' "" Le-Frak said. ""But the answer is, it's an expensive investment."" \(c)The Washington Post\Credit: BY MICHAEL LARIS"

222,"
The Nov. 5 election brought big changes to the U.S. Congress, with Republicans taking control of the Senate, and with new faces and leadership changes in both parties. What will this mean to the nation when the 108th Congress convenes in January? We asked members of the Tristate's congressional delegation to share their thoughts. Here are their responses to our four questions:
\
What will your top personal priority be in the new Congress?
\
Sen. DeWine: Since I was first elected to the Senate in 1994, I have focused a great deal of my efforts on improving the lives of children. I will continue to focus on that mission every day. Nothing is more important than the health, well-being and future of our children.
\
Sen. Voinovich: Several major issues will be before Congress next year: access to affordable health care, a Medicare prescription drug benefit, an energy bill, budget reform, and welfare and workforce reauthorizations, to name a few. I will be closely involved with all of these as well as with rewriting the federal highway bill. Improving the quality of our infrastructure and increasing the amount of Ohio's gas tax dollars we get back from Washington will be priorities.
\
Sen. Bunning: First, I think Congress needs to pass legislation to help stimulate the economy - tax cuts, job-creation incentives. And then there are many important issues left over from the current session: Medicare prescription drug reform, further welfare reform, terrorism insurance legislation, bankruptcy reform, confirming vital judicial nominations.
\
Sen. Bayh: Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, America's national security has become the No. 1 priority for Congress and the president. Both parties need to work together to protect Americans from terrorist threats, increase our domestic and international intelligence capabilities, and otherwise protect our national security. But we must also take action to create jobs and stimulate the economy. A strong economy is vital to America's national security.
\
Rep. Chabot: We must work to improve the economy and protect jobs. In part, this can be accomplished through tax relief that allows hard-working men and women to keep more of the money they earn. Continuing our efforts to strengthen our national security is another top priority. I am also extremely hopeful that my bipartisan legislation to ban partial-birth abortion will pass Congress and will be signed by the president.
\
Rep. Portman: First, to see that our country is better prepared to protect all Americans from the terrorist threat. I have spent the past week or so working hard on getting the Department of Homeland Security legislation through Congress. I think we'll finally get it done. In the new Congress, I will continue to work to ensure the new Department can do the job. I will also continue my efforts to reform and simplify the tax code. It is too complicated, too big and the way it works is unfair. Finally, I will be spending a lot of time on retirement security: Being sure Medicare is strengthened for the future and prescription drug coverage for seniors is provided now, and continuing my work to let people save more for their own retirement through 401(k)s, IRAs and other pensions.
\
Rep. Boehner: As Chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, my top priority for the 108th Congress is to continue the progress we've made on education reform - progress that began right here in Southwest Ohio when President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act. If the federal government is going to be involved with education, it needs to do more than just spend money, because money alone isn't the answer to problems that exist. We need to ensure results for children, restore local control, expand parental choice, and ensure teachers and principals have the tools and freedom to do their jobs. In the new Congress, we will work to bring this focus on results to special education, Head Start, and higher education as well.
\
Rep. Lucas: My goal remains to create good-paying jobs, improve access to health care, including the enactment of a meaningful prescription drug benefit through Medicare, and make certain our children can take advantage of college and job training. These steps foster an environment where our families and economy prosper.
\
Given the narrow margin between the two parties, what will their working relationship be like, and will we see a clearing of the present legislative logjam on various issues?
\
Sen. DeWine: Senate rules dictate that 60 votes are needed to break a filibuster. Since the 51 Republicans e are not enough to break a filibuster, the Democrats could, if they choose, frustrate the process. I am optimistic that the Democrats will work with the Republicans and with President Bush to pass laws that are important to all Americans.
\
Sen. Voinovich: Despite a Republican victory the Senate still is almost evenly divided. Republican committee chairs will be able to move legislation easier and set the floor agenda, but the Senate's unique rules still require 60 votes to pass legislation. Bipartisan cooperation will continue to be required to get work done and, as I did as governor, I will continue to reach out to the other side of the political aisle to help set a constructive tone.
\
Sen. Bunning: I disagree that there is a ""narrow"" margin. Republicans won a strong majority of the votes in contested Senate races across the country on Nov. 5. Still, the numbers in the Senate are relatively narrow, and since 60 votes are needed to pass most major bills we need to work harder to build bipartisan coalitions to pass them. I am cautiously optimistic that we can do this beginning in 2003.
\
Sen. Bayh: I am hopeful that both parties will put politics aside and come to agreement on critically important issues. We need to work together to get the economy moving forward again, create new jobs, and fight the war against terrorism.
\
Rep. Chabot: We must make every effort to work in a bipartisan fashion. While we successfully addressed many critical issues in the House during the last Congress - including economic stimulus legislation and a prescription drug benefit for seniors - these initiatives were too often blocked in the Senate. The Republican majority in the Senate will allow more of these issues to be considered, but a significant number of Democrat votes will still be needed to enact meaningful reforms.
\
Rep. Portman: It will be easier to get things done, but still tough. Senate rules on filibusters really mean that you need a super-majority of 60 votes to pass most bills. But we've already seen progress on the homeland security issue, and it will certainly help in getting good judges on the federal bench.
\
Rep. Boehner: I am hopeful that much of the legislation approved by the House over the past two years now can be considered by the Senate. For example, I authored a pension security bill to give workers more freedom to diversify their retirement savings and get better advice. It passed the House but never saw the light of day in the Senate. The House also passed a comprehensive energy plan, a Medicare prescription drug benefit, and permanent tax relief without any action from the Senate. Though the two bodies are fundamentally different in how we consider legislation, I believe the new leadership on that side of the Capitol will be more compelled to act on the president's legislative agenda.
\
Rep. Lucas: It is important that the parties work together in a bipartisan way to address the issues facing the American people. I am confident that Congress can put partisan disagreements aside and place the needs of the nation ahead of political gamesmanship.
\
Given the power shift in the Senate, what is the first major change we are likely to see?
\
Sen. DeWine: President Bush's judicial nominees will be confirmed at a much faster pace. President Bush has nominated extremely well qualified judges to the federal bench. Some of the judicial nominees, including Ohio's Deborah Cook and Jeffrey Sutton, were never even given a hearing. I expect the Judiciary Committee, of which I am a member, will expeditiously move these exemplary judges to the Senate floor for a vote.
\
Sen. Voinovich: Obstruction seemed to be the operative word for Senate Democrats for the past two years. Given that, it will be a significant and welcome change to see the Senate moving legislation and confirmations again, especially the two pending judicial nominations for the 6th Circuit, based in Cincinnati. The appellate bench has been depleted by retirements and is in need of additional judges to handle the normal workload.
\
Sen. Bunning: The first big change we'll see is with the federal judiciary. There are a number of openings on the federal bench, and now we'll see the President's nominees confirmed more quickly. Justice delayed is justice denied.
\
Sen. Bayh: The Senate remains closely divided and both sides will have to reach across party lines and work in a bipartisan way to get things done. The American people expect this of us, and the support of centrists will be crucial.
\
Rep. Chabot: One of the first significant changes should be more expeditious consideration of federal judicial appointees. As Chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee, I held a hearing in October to review the negative impact that the stalled judicial nomination process in the Senate has had on justice in the federal courts. For example, in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals (which serves Cincinnati), seven of the 16 judicial seats are vacant.
\
Rep. Portman: I think the biggest change is that important issues will finally be brought to the Senate floor for an open debate and a vote. Last year, the Senate Democrat leadership did not bring forward important bills ranging from pension security to welfare reform to the president's faith-based initiative. They also kept the president's judicial nominees bottled up in cCommittee. Now, we will finally see these important issues debated and voted on.
\
Rep. Boehner: In the long term, we can expect to see a greater consideration of the president's agenda, as I just described. More immediately, I expect we will see a noticeable difference in the manner the Senate will act on the president's nominees for the federal courts.
\
Rep. Lucas: The first visible changes will be structural, with the election of new Senate leadership and new committee chairs. And once again, it will be incumbent on both parties to work together to address the pressing issues facing our nation, including the need to strengthen our economy and to protect our nation against unprecedented threats.
\
What is Congress' most pressing economic issue, in your view?
\
Sen. DeWine: First of all, it is important to point out that Congress is only one thread of America's economic fabric. That being said, it is up to Congress to pass meaningful trade initiatives, energy legislation and tax cuts to help stimulate the economy.
\
Sen. Voinovich: Increased spending by Congress and the resulting federal budget deficit is the biggest threat to our economic recovery. In the short term, increased federal borrowing puts pressure on interest rates and restricts private capital markets. In the long term, the continued raiding of the Social Security surplus to fund government operations makes it that much harder to deal with Social Security's looming insolvency. Congress must stop spending money like drunken sailors so the federal government can stop borrowing and stop raiding Social Security.
\
Sen. Bunning: We need to kick-start the economy. And the first step is helping ensure that there is an atmosphere of trust in corporate governance where people believe what they read and are told by corporate CEOs. When we fully trust business again, investing and economic growth will pick back up.
\
Sen. Bayh: The most urgent goal for Congress is to get the economy moving again. We must work in a bipartisan manner to create jobs that provide American families with a living wage and financial security, which in-turn provides for retirement security for older Americans.
\
Rep. Chabot: We must pass tax relief legislation that lets working families keep more of their money, improves the economy and spurs job creation. At the same time, Congress should curb the excessive increases in federal spending that have contributed to our growing budget deficit.
\
Rep. Portman: We need to do all we can to get this economy back on track. This means keeping our spending under control because excessive deficits hurt the economy. But it also means being sure we do what we can to stimulate economic growth and investor confidence in the short term. I like the idea of making the existing tax cuts permanent so people and businesses can plan, but I also think we should accelerate some of that relief - for instance getting more money into the markets and into diminished accounts by letting people save more tax-free in an IRA or 401(k).
\
Rep. Boehner: Congress must play a role in addressing the skyrocketing costs of health insurance, which are directly responsible for the fact that more than 40 million Americans - and 2 million Ohioans - are left uninsured. My committee will consider a variety of ways to decrease the ranks of the uninsured without heavy-handed, short-sighted federal government mandates. One such idea under consideration is the expansion of association health plans to allow small businesses, labor unions, and other organizations to pool their resources and purchase health insurance for their employees at lower costs.
\
Rep. Lucas: Economic development is crucial for our communities, and I am working to spur economic growth, create jobs, and provide opportunities for working families. I support worker training programs, infrastructure improvements, and incentives for business development.
\
Note: Our questions also went to these other members of our area delegation who did not respond in time: Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.; Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.; Rep. Baron Hill, D-Ind.; Rep.-elect Mike Turner, R-Ohio.

In right place, small turbines can cut costs
\
By Mike Boyer
\
mboyer@enquirer.com
\
REILY TWP. -- When Ron and Victoria Cox rebuilt their 100-year-old farmhouse after a fire over a year ago, they added a small wind turbine to generate electricity. Although the wind is down in summer on their hillside farm, the Skystream turbine, which sits on a 50-foot pole about 100 feet from their house, cut electric bills almost in half last winter.
\
Now, the Coxes plan to add a second turbine and become distributors.
\
""This doesn't hurt anybody, and it's a good investment in the future,"" Victoria Cox, 60, said.
\
Wind power hasn't stirred much of a breeze in the United States, until now.
\
But as oil and natural gas prices rise, wind power - ranging from small individual turbines to large utility-scale wind farms - is gaining velocity.
\
Suddenly, wind is prime time thanks to Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens' multimillion-dollar media campaign touting his $14 billion wind project to reduce U.S. reliance on imported oil.
\
Wind power represents only 1 percent of the nation's energy, but last year the United States led the world with more than 5,000 megawatts of new wind capacity. The Department of Energy says wind power could produce 20 percent of the nation's energy by 2030.
\
Ohio's only utility-scale wind farm produces 7.2 megawatts of electricity, enough to serve about 1,850 homes, in Bowling Green. Kentucky has no wind farms.
\
By comparison, the nation's leaders - Texas and California - had 4,446 megawatts and 2,439 megawatts of wind capacity, respectively, at the end of last year, according to the Department of Energy. A megawatt of wind- generated electricity can supply about 300 homes.
\
A megawatt is a measure of total capacity, and the length of time it can supply a home depends on how long the wind blows and how much power customers draw, according to the American Wind Energy Association.
\
Potential locations for large-scale wind projects in Kentucky are generally limited to the eastern part of the state, said Andrew Melnykovych, spokesman for the Kentucky Public Service Commission.
\
Nonetheless, Gov. Steve Beshear last month announced plans to develop a comprehensive energy strategy that includes greater reliance on renewable sources such as wind.
\
And Kentucky's PSC is contemplating expanding guidelines for utility net-metering, which gives customers credit for the excess electricity they generate. The PSC change would expand net-metering to include wind turbines and not just solar collection systems as it does now.
\
Ohio's new energy law, initiated by Gov. Ted Strickland, requires the state's four investor-owned utilities to generate 12.5 percent of their power from renewable sources such as wind and solar by 2025.
\
Utilities, including Duke Energy, with more than 600,000 customers in Southwest Ohio, are seeking proposals for renewable energy to feed their electric systems starting next year.
\
Customer-generated wind and solar are still minute in Duke's Ohio and Kentucky service area. Of 29 net-metering customers, with 165 kilowatts of capacity, the Cox family is one of just three customers using wind, for a total of 14 kilowatts of electricity.
\
The remaining have solar collection systems. But Duke says the number of net-metering customers has increased dramatically in the past two years. The utility had just six net-metering customers before 2007.
\
While experts say Southwest Ohio doesn't have sufficient wind to make large-scale projects economical, that doesn't mean homeowners and businesses won't makes investments in smaller turbines to supply a portion of their power.
\
Because the wind itself is free, an investment in a turbine ""is a hedge against future fuel price hikes,"" said Joe Jefferis, managing partner of Powerflo LLC, the Dayton, Ohio, distributor of the Sky- stream turbine bought by the Coxes. Skystream turbines won't supply all of a home's electricity, but they can reduce the power homeowners buy from their utility by as much as 40 percent, he said.
\
""We're in the midst of a dramatic change to renewable energy,"" said Jefferis. ""Skystream turbines allow individuals to participate in the change just like buying a hybrid car.""
\
The Skystream turbines, produced by Arizona-based Southwest Windpower Inc., start around $15,000, but rising steel prices for poles and other costs are pushing up installation expenses. Since 2004, the state of Ohio has offered grants to homeowners for up to half the installation cost of renewable projects, including wind turbines.
\
But that program has been suspended since spring while the Ohio Department of Development, which administers it, makes changes aimed at enhancing the program, said Christina Panoska, outreach manager. The program has made grants for 65 residential wind projects across Ohio since 2004. The agency will be outlining changes in the program to installers on Wednesday and expects to resume making grants later this year, she said.
\
Geoff Greenfield is president of Third Sun Solar and Wind Power Ltd., an Athens company that has installed more than 200 solar and wind systems since 1997, including Southwest Ohio's largest wind installation, a six-turbine system at the Ralph Dull farm northwest of Dayton. Greenfield says the new interest in wind is an important step in developing the nation's energy independence.
\
But he concedes: ""For most homeowners, wind isn't as cost-effective as solar.""
\
The economics of installing a small wind turbine compared with a comparable rooftop solar collection system don't add up for most homeowners in part because there's a $2,000 federal income tax credit for solar, which isn't available for wind, he said. In addition, a wind turbine has a lot of moving parts compared with a solar collector, which can mean ongoing maintenance expenses, he said.
\
Still, wind advocates won't be deterred.
\
""We used to curse the wind,"" said Victoria Cox when she and her husband were rebuilding. But now with their net-metering agreement with Duke, they know when the wind blows it's helping their utility bills down.
\
""We love the wind,"" she says.

Tips for small wind turbines
\
The market for small wind turbines, under 100 kilowatts in size, grew 14 percent last year by homeowners and businesses concerned about rising electric rates and the environment, according to the American Wind Energy Association.
\
But before you spend thousands of dollars on a small turbine, there are a number of things to consider. Among them:
\
Do you have enough wind? Most systems require an annual average wind speed of at least 10 mph. A wind analysis can cost thousands of dollars but the Ohio Wind Resource Explorer, an interactive Web site developed by the Ohio Department of Development, is at www.windexplorer.com/wre/.
\
Talk to your local zoning department about permits, setbacks and other requirements. Most systems require at least half an acre of land.
\
Contact your electric supplier about net-metering contracts which allow the excess power you generate to be fed onto its electric system, generating credit on your electric bill.
"
224,"Installing solar panels on your roof is not just for tree-hugging environmentalists. The increasing ease of the process and the financial returns have made going solar practically mainstream. \""By the end of 2020, the amount of installed solar capacity will be 300 percent higher than today,"" said Dan Whitten, vice president of communications at the Solar Energy Industries Association. ""Nationwide, it grew 10 times between 2008 and 2015."" \In Washington, residential solar installations have tripled since 2011, said Chelsea Barnes with EQ Research. \Sun shining on solar panels generates electricity that goes directly into your home's breaker panel, which supplies electricity to power your appliances and devices. \The power that panels produce but you don't use goes out of your meter and back into the grid for later use. A net meter -- installed by your utility company in place of the standard meter -- rolls backward, and at the end of the month calculates your ""net"" usage from the grid. This is called net metering. \Power generated from the sun is meant to offset your electric bill. How much offset you get depends on how many panels are installed and how much electricity your family uses. \Whatever the amount is, your household remains connected to the grid and you receive an electric bill from the utility. \The goal is to reduce your utility expenses as much as possible. \Eventually, the savings on the electric bill will add up to what you paid for the system, which means from then on you're basically getting free electricity. The average return on investment is 5 1/2 years in Washington, said JD Elkurd, executive director of Solar Solution. \The process starts with a site evaluation. \""We go up on the roof. We look at the direction of sunlight, take measurements of the space, see obstacles like air conditioners, vents, ducts, compressors and skylights. Then we know where everything is, how many panels can fit, and we can set them to maximize sun exposure,"" Elkurd said. \""People assume solar panels have to be on your roof, but they can be on an adjacent structure,"" said Chris Pierce, who lives on Capitol Hill in Washington. ""Our roof is slate, which can't accommodate panels. But the garage is shingled, and Solar Solution said we could put up 18. They made a computerized drawing on the spot to show us what it would look like."" \Installers told Washington resident Greg Crist that based on the sun's position, a porch would be ideal for panels. So as part of a house renovation, he added a front porch and 13 panels were installed on it. \The navy blue, 250-watt, 3-by-5-foot glass panels are manufactured in the United States, China and Mexico. The aluminum racking system Solar Solution uses is made in North Carolina and California. California-made micro-inverters attached to the back of each panel convert the solar energy from a DC current to AC so that the electricity can be used in your home. Panels and micro-inverters have 25-year warranties. \Tax breaks and other incentives reduce the cost of electricity and cover a large portion of a system's cost. ""That's why 90 percent of our customers are in the solar business. For financial reasons, it makes sense,"" said Elkurd. \Here are ways to defray the cost of your system: \- Federal tax credit: One nationwide incentive is an FTC equivalent to 30 percent of the cost. This credit was supposed to expire in December 2016 but was extended for five years. \- Solar Renewable Energy Certificates: Government policy has further incentivized solar on a state level with SRECs. \SRECs are a credit homeowners get when they supply power to a brokerage market and can help offset the initial cost of the system. \Customers can sell SRECs to Solar Solution. ""We'll buy -- in advance -- eight years worth of SRECs and apply that money to your project cost, bringing it down about 35 percent (including federal tax credits),"" Elkurd said. \The average system size installed in Washington last year was five kilowatts, with 20 panels and a cost of $16,000, he said. After a 30 percent tax credit of $4,800 and an upfront credit of $5,500 for the SRECs, the cost would be $5,700. This size system typically provides electricity savings of $950 per year at today's rates. \Homeowners can instead broker their SRECs independently (via SRECTrade.com or another brokerage) and receive a check each time a credit is produced. That's what Crist did. \""I chose to go with a brokerage because I ran the numbers and thought I could make more than the $11,000 Solar Solution offered,"" he said. \Crist said he hopes to pay off his system in a couple of years and make a profit on SREC sales. \- Property tax exemption: In Washington, a property tax abatement ruling allows homeowners to exclude the added value of a solar system from their property value. For every dollar of electricity savings per year, property value is estimated to increase by $20, said Elkurd. The property value of the system described above increased by about $19,000. \- Income-based grants: The federal government sets qualifying income levels. For a household of two, the maximum annual income is $40,967; for a household of four, it's $60,245. \Solar Solution obtained support from D.C. Sustainable Energy Utility, a nonprofit contractor to the D.C. Department of Energy and Environment. DCSEU provides grants to solar contractors who provide and install solar systems for low-and moderate-income District residents at no cost. \- Option to lease: If you don't want to buy a solar system, you can lease one for a small application fee. Solar providers own the system, so you don't pay for installation. You pay for the electricity, but at cheaper rate than the utility charges.\Credit: ByAudrey Hoffer, Special to The Washington Post"

WOOSTER -- Utilizing solar energy has become a new way for agricultural businesses to not only save a couple of dollars, but also potentially save thousands of dollars on their annual tax bills.
\
Farms use quite a lot of electricity,"" explained Frederick Michel, an associate professor of biosystems engineering in the Department of Food, Agricultural and Biological Engineering at the Ohio State University-OARDC. ""And solar panels can provide that energy, at a cost lower than purchasing electricity from the grid in many cases.""
\
Michel noted, ""solar power is also much more environmentally friendly than utilizing energy from the grid simply because it only depends on energy taken from the sun, instead of the energy that is sourced from the use of finite fossil fuels, generates almost no greenhouse gas emissions and does not rely on mining and fracking that permanently degrade the environment.""
\
""Farmers very much depend on the weather and climate for their livelihood. But climate change, which is caused by the use of fossil fuels and the release of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere, threatens that,"" said Michel, explaining the negative effects of using electricity from the grid expected to have on farming operations in the future.
\
Michel said the usage of solar power within agricultural businesses is continually growing, largely thanks to the fact the cost of installing a solar power unit into your business or home has decreased dramatically since the systems first hit the market decades ago.
\
Many businesses that install and work on solar power systems insist they are not only relatively low cost (especially when combined with various government incentives such as the USDA REAP program, net metering, renewable energy credits and a 30 percent federal renewable energy tax credit), but that they are almost maintenance free.
\
Thanks to the USDA's Rural Development REAP (Rural Energy for America Program), there is a 25 percent grant available for the total cost of a system for farmers or any business owners in a rural areas such as Wayne County who make the move to solar energy generation systems. Some of the things that those producers can do that REAP will assist them with include the purchase and installation of a new renewable energy system, the purchase of a refurbished renewable energy system, the retrofitting of an existing renewable energy system and making energy efficiency improvements.
\
Some of those perks provided by REAP include a reimbursement grant, which includes an agreement the producer will report his energy savings for two years after receiving the grant for making energy efficiency improvements. Initially the producer must be the one to make the entire investment in setting up the new systems within his business. REAP also offers loan guarantees, grants and a combination of loan guarantees and grants to get the producer the most bang for his renewable energy investment buck.

226,"
Sylvania residents will soon get a sense of how big their city officials are willing to dream in pursuit of renewable energy - and what that could mean in terms of short-term expenditures and long-term savings.
\
The first of what will likely be several discussions about green energy is scheduled for 6 tonight in Sylvania council chambers, 6635 Maplewood Ave.
\
The program, arranged by Keith Haddad, chairman of Sylvania's Utilities and Environment Committee, was publicized as a brainstorming session for eventually getting the city off the regional electric grid and making it self-sufficient for energy.
\
Whether that's practical or even technologically possible remains to be seen. Mr. Haddad and others conceded that anything close to energy self-sufficiency won't happen overnight and without a multimillion-dollar investment.
\
Only 2 percent of the nation's energy comes from renewable sources. A bill that would have required 20 percent of the nation's energy to come from renewables by 2020 died in Congress, although several states have enacted such mandates. But not Ohio.
\
Wind is the fastest-growing sector. The American Wind Energy Association predicts it will account for 6 percent of U.S. energy by 2020, six times greater than the 1 percent market share it now commands.
\
Whatever the odds, Mr. Haddad said he wants Sylvania to get serious about renewable energy.
\
He said the city needs to reduce its dependence on FirstEnergy Corp. for electricity and do more than just fret over $3-a-gallon gas prices, war in the Middle East, and the prospect of running short of cash while trying to heat buildings with natural gas this winter.
\
""I want to make our council aware of some of the things out there,"" he said.
\
Possible options include:
\
Solar panels for the Tam O'Shanter ice arena at 7060 Sylvania Ave., which the city owns and leases to a private company. The city pays $17,000 a month to make ice.
\
It could do what Bowling Green State University did in the fall of 2004 at a cost of $238,000: Install solar panels to produce electricity that offsets ice-making energy costs. In effect, sunlight is being used to produce some of the ice at BGSU's arena. Sylvania could do the same, Mr. Haddad said.
\
Wind turbines. Bowling Green has four of them in the Wood County landfill, about six miles southwest of the city off U.S. 6.
\
They produce about 3 percent of the energy that Bowling Green uses itself and distributes to its residents. Sylvania could do something similar, although it is not an electricity supplier. But under Ohio's net-metering law, any electricity it produces for the grid can result in credits from FirstEnergy.
\
Hybrid vehicles. Sylvania could phase them in as vehicles need to be replaced.
\
Biodiesel, ethanol, and other types of alternative fuel that can reduce the nation's reliance on crude oil. City vehicles could use them.
\
Cleaner uses of coal. ""Coal is our most abundant resource. We should be jumping on that bandwagon,"" Mr. Haddad said, referring to supporting the use of coal in devices other than polluting coal-fired power plants.
\
Sylvania also could revisit its options for buying electricity in bulk as a member of the Northwest Ohio Aggregation Group. It is one of nine members of that group, which collectively serves 133,000 homes.
\
Others include Maumee, Oregon, Toledo, Northwood, Perrysburg, Holland, and unincorporated areas of Lucas County and Lake Township in Wood County.
\
While Mr. Haddad said his immediate focus is on city buildings and vehicles, others speaking at tonight's meeting will talk about efforts to get more renewables in Sylvania's private sector.
\
Mike Killian, Lourdes College vice president for finance and administration, said he will talk about the college's interest in having buildings retrofitted so that their heating and cooling costs can be offset by geothermal energy tapped from the ground.
\
""We've taken a serious interest in it,"" Mr. Killian said, explaining that data are being collected from a 300-foot test well.
\
""It's the baby steps we're taking,"" he said. ""Is there enough interest in the leadership to continue in the direction we're taking? We know the price of oil's not going to get any cheaper. And [oil] is not a renewable resource.""
\
Al Compaan of Sylvania, a University of Toledo researcher who has installed solar panels at his house and at his church, Sylvania United Church of Christ, said he's pleased the issue has gained some interest in his city.
\
""It can really stimulate the rest of the region to look at it,"" he said.
\
""I would like to see Sylvania step forward and take a leadership role for renewable energy,"" Mr. Compaan said.
\
Other speakers tonight are to include Daryl Stockburger, the former Bowling Green utilities director credited for bringing wind turbines to that city, and Jim Gee, general manager of the Toledo Area Regional Transit Authority - TARTA - which is looking into more energy-efficient transportation.
\
Bill Spratley, executive director of Green Energy Ohio, the Columbus-based nonprofit that has been pushing renewable energy statewide, admitted he wasn't aware of Sylvania's budding interest. But he said he's pleased by it.

With 14 carefully placed panels sipping light from the sun, the meter on the side of Carol Bintz's new home in Monclova Township spins backward in the summer months, sending excess power created by her
\
solar-panel system to the Edison grid, significantly reducing the home's energy costs.
\
Ms. Bintz's commitment to lessening her environmental impact, and trimming energy bills in the process, places her among legions of architects, builders, and home buyers looking to save two very different kinds of green.
\
""If I was going to make a change, I was going to build a house and make it as energy-efficient as I could,"" Ms. Bintz said.
\
Even though urban planners say the cost of filling the SUV will cause more people to live in city centers, residents such as Ms. Bintz are finding ways to stay in the cozy suburbs they've grown to love.
\
The longtime Toledo-area resident chose to fight demographic trends that planners say will shape America's future.
\
As the 82 million baby boomers born from 1946 to 1964 become empty-nesters looking to downsize their homes, and as the 78 million millennials born from 1977 to 1996 become young professionals looking for their first apartments, the two groups may well converge in one up-and-coming area: city centers.
\
But Ms. Bintz could not have easily installed a state-of-the-art geothermal system to complement her solar panels if she had selected a site in the city.
\
The system, which draws energy from the ground left behind by the sun and uses it to heat and cool her home, required sophisticated pipes to be planted beneath her lawn where ground temperatures hover around 55 degrees.
\
According to the American Solar Energy Society, the world's energy needs could be met entirely by capturing sunlight hitting the Earth.
\
Duane Horst, president of Overcashier & Horst, a Sylvania heating and cooling contractor that oversaw the geothermal installation, said interest in the system has mushroomed among home builders.
\
""Nowadays, energy costs scare us all, and [homeowners] are spending extra money here first before they put in more expensive cabinets,"" he said. Ms. Bintz paid $9,500 for the geothermal system and $16,900 for the Sharp solar panels on her roof. Additional money for things like high-end wall and basement insulation brought her total energy upgrades to $28,000.
\
'A long payback'
\
Bill Decker, Sr., whose Bedford Township-based Decker Homes is building her ranch, said the biggest deterrent to proliferating this ""whole-house system"" is the cost.
\
""It's a long payback, but there's more to it than payback for most people,"" he said.
\
Mr. Decker expects Ms. Bintz to save roughly $800 per year on her electric and heating bills once she moves in this September - a figure that will likely increase in coming years as energy prices continue to climb.
\
""If it's a break-even, that's a break-even at today's electric rates,"" Ms. Bintz said. ""And those are rates that are not going to go down.""
\
The average price Americans pay to heat their homes during the winter has increased by nearly 50 percent over the past five winters, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
\
Homeowners in the northeast and the southeast tend to pay the highest rates, while Ohioans fall somewhere in the middle of the pack.
\
But northwest Ohioans pay some of the highest electric rates in the state and the region.
\
The 2-kilowatt solar panel system, hidden almost entirely on the backside of Ms. Bintz's home where it faces southward, turns a little more than 12 percent of the sunlight it collects into electricity, an efficiency Mr. Decker anticipates will increase as technology improves.
\
Northwest Ohio receives about 70 percent of the sunlight that Miami gets.
\
According to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, utility companies in Ohio allow people such as Ms. Bintz to send extra power to the electric distribution system and receive a credit on energy bills, a process called net metering. Theoretically, if Ms. Bintz collected enough power, she could eliminate her monthly energy bill or offset charges in cloudy months when the solar panels are less effective.
\
Perhaps more important to Ms. Bintz, who first investigated solar panels as manager of the Toledo Museum of Art's investment in a 100-kilowatt system, is the reduction of her carbon footprint.
\
Her new home reduces greenhouse gases because it does not draw as much energy from coal-fired power plants.
\
""Somebody has to start doing it,"" she said.
\
Mr. Decker said he studies energy-efficient building techniques two to four hours a day and tries to apply them to the homes he builds.
\
""More [carbon] is put into the atmosphere by buildings than by automobiles,"" he said. ""We're focused on energy conservation. We think that's part of the equation of how we'll be living. If you went to Europe, you would see they have completely green cities.""
\
The U.S. Department of Energy currently sponsors a program called ""Building America,"" aimed at producing homes on a community scale that use, on average, 30 to 90 percent less energy. The program also hopes to integrate on-site power systems that lead to ""zero-energy"" homes producing as much energy as they use by 2020.
\
Changing to green
\
Other architects and builders are beginning to develop the same mind-set as Mr. Decker.
\
Kevin Kennon, executive director of the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies in New York City, said technology and building techniques are improving.
\
""The single biggest problem with buildings today is [lack of] insulation. It's a huge energy drain,"" he said. ""We're starting to use new technology from glass, we're able to control sunlight and glare, we're taking advantage of building orientation.""
\
Many architecture firms around the country require their designers to keep abreast of environmentally sustainable construction.
\
The U.S. Green Building Council developed the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System in 1998 to shape ""green building"" standards of measurement and recognize environmental leadership in the building industry.
\
""You are really building a high performance building rather than just a building that is good for the environment,"" said Michael Bongiorno, an architect for Design Group in Columbus and a LEED accredited professional. ""I think even developers realize that there are savings to them.""
\
Mr. Bongiorno said taking advantage of the sun has become a crucial piece of building design.
\
Shades can block summer sun to cool a building and percolate it through to heat a building in the winter. The sun also provides an excellent source of free lighting.
\
""There is a lot of exploration into material technology,"" Mr. Bongiorno said. ""Making smart material like roof shingles that are actually photo-voltaic shingles.""
\
From tiny Normal, Ill.- first in the U.S. to require LEED certified designs for private sector development - to mammoth New York City - home to the 7 World Trade Center building, considered the country's first ""green"" office tower by earning a LEED gold stamp - cities across the country are committing to construction that is environmentally friendly and cost effective.
\
Buildings become certified by accumulating points for design elements such as reduction in water use, recycling of materials, construction within two miles of a bus line, and even installation of bike racks and showers.
\
A convergence
\
Ted Ligibel, a professor of historic preservation at Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, Mich., said historic preservation is merging with the environmental movement in the building industry.
\
The former Toledo resident deemed energy considerations chief among builders' future concerns.
\
""We could have an energy audit to determine how much energy you are going to lose that's already embodied in that current infrastructure versus what it will cost in energy to rebuild something,"" he said. ""Old buildings hold so much embodied energy.""
\
Urban life lends itself nicely to much of the building criteria, and as Americans rediscover the city center, builders will likely not only be catering to commercial interests, but also to prospective residents.
\
Urban planners say America is overbuilt with large, single-family homes that may become unwanted and underpriced.
\
For developers, urban residential complexes can be much more cost effective.
\
Though the country has poured a majority of development dollars into low-density suburban development over the past 50 years, from a cost perspective, high-density urban development makes more sense.
\
Sewer lines, for example, are roughly the same in the suburbs as they are in downtowns, yet in the suburbs a sewer line may only service one family per acre while a line of the same length may service 40 families in an urban setting. It is a matter of taking a fixed cost and dividing it by larger use.
\
Mr. Bongiorno said often the problem in creating suburban communities out of farmlands centers on a lack of existing infrastructure.
\
""It's an economy of scale,"" he said. ""In urban development there are not as many new investments or materials being created.""
\
Costs shared among more tightly packed residents extends beyond just building materials.
\
The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation ranks the United States - the world's richest country - 12th in its world broadband connectivity ranking, a reflection of subscriber volume, average connection speed, and cost.
\
Higher speeds and subscriptions in countries such as Japan and South Korea, which rank at the top of the list, are often attributed to their highly urbanized makeup.
\
In the United States, it is more difficult to provide broadband access for a sprawled population.
\
Demand for downsizing
\
In the tussle between urban and suburban, demographics seem to favor the former.
\
According to a housing analysis by Zimmerman, Volk Associates, married couples with children - the traditional American family - represent only 22 percent of U.S. households.
\
More than 5 million households contain unmarried couples, a near 70 percent increase since 1990.
\
And probably the largest right hook to the bloated suburban housing market is the combined purchasing power of 160 million baby boomers and millennials who are more likely to be looking for smaller dwellings and amenities more readily offered in city centers.
\
Don Feller, president of Toledo-area Feller Finch Associates, a firm specializing in civil engineering and land surveying, said many of his developer clients have been following empty nesters.
\
""There's a big demand for downsizing,"" he said.
\
""People don't want to mow the lawn or shovel the walks. They are leaving their $400,000 homes.""
\
Heading downtown
\
Americans will likely first reduce their driving, then get a new car, then consider moving, said Mike Young, a senior urban designer for the Rick Company in San Diego and a former Toledo city planner. But when they do decide to move, downtowns will seem a more reasonable option.
\
""In general terms, people will look to move closer to the amenities,"" he said. ""There's only one great university, one great art museum, one great zoo, one great theater.""
\
Mr. Decker, who has been operating his home building company since 1981, said builders don't usually create the market, but instead choose to follow it.
\
""If that's what the market wants, that's where we're going to build it,"" he said.
\
But not all home builders believe a nebulous American appetite will lead them away from the suburbs.
\
""I don't see it happening,"" said Jon Jones, sales manager from Decker Building Co. of Temperance, Mich., a company owned by Mr. Decker's son, Bill Decker, Jr.
\
""I think people want to live in the suburban area. They're going to battle to stay out here rather than [move] downtown.""
\
Mr. Jones said his company has built as many as 72 homes in a calendar year, but mired in a struggling national economy and mortgage crisis, this year the tally has been only eight.
\
Jeff Wehrle, owner of Forrester Wehrle Builders, another prominent builder in the Toledo area, agrees with Mr. Jones and believes the dip in home building reflects an industry that is naturally cyclical.
\
""It's going to swing back,"" he said.
\
Mr. Wehrle said there is nowhere downtown for kids to play, nowhere for teenagers to hang out.
\
And above all else, Mr. Wehrle contends the suburbs still have a major advantage over urban areas in terms of safety and school quality.
\
""There's a small population that desires to be in a downtown urban area,"" he said, ""but as long as there are still good roads and good schools, families will still live in the suburbs.""

228,"Opponents of the planned Black Fork Wind Farm in northern Crawford and Richland counties can rest easy for the time being. For a variety of reasons, the project is on hold until further notice.\""Element Power continues to invest in the project and believe in the market. As far as moving forward this year or early next year, that's not likely,"" said Scott Zeimetz, a spokesperson for the Portland, Ore.-based renewable-energy company that would maintain the project's wind turbines.\The Black Fork Wind Farm, approved by the Ohio Power Siting Board two years ago, is one of several wind farms in the early stages of development across north central and west central Ohio, and would be the largest of those projects.\The project was stuck in the state's court system until December, when the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that opponents' due process was not violated during the siting board's hearing on Element Power's application to site the Black Fork project near the Crawford County village of Tiro.\But other hurdles stand in the way of the Black Fork Wind Farm becoming reality anytime soon.\Hurdles\Construction of new wind-energy projects has virtually ground to a halt nationwide in recent years as energy prices have been forced down by the abundance of cheap, domestic natural gas, not to mention federal tax subsidies designed to encourage renewable power sources like wind energy.\As a result, wind farms looking to sign power-purchase agreements with conventional utilities are now confronted with a challenging environment.\""There haven't been very many PPAs signed for a while in Ohio, and there are different things at the state level dictating that,"" Zeimetz said. ""But we believe Ohio will be a good place for wind energy given the rules in place and its economic impact, particularly the amount of jobs it brings.""\However, various economic incentives created to aid renewable energy sources like wind are fighting for their lives, on both the state and federal levels.\Under Ohio's renewable portfolio standard, 25 percent of electricity sold in the state must be generated from alternative energy sources by 2025. At least half of this energy must come from renewable sources such as wind, and half of the renewable facilities must be located in the state.\Legislation now under consideration in the Ohio Senate would freeze that mandate at the much lower 2014 level. Critics of the RPS claim that it subsidizes endeavors like wind power at the expense of fossil-fuel industries.\""I definitely don't agree with that. The entire energy industry is subsidized. Fossil fuels are all subsidized,"" said Emily Sautter, wind energy program manager for the advocacy group Green Energy Ohio.\""The state RPS is the primary driver for development. It's what's creating demand for renewable energy. With that gone, there will be no incentive to sign on to a purchase-power agreement. A lot of wind farms are having trouble selling their power now.""\Blue Creek project\Blue Creek Wind Farm, the first and currently largest such facility in the state, in western Ohio's Paulding and Van Wert counties, has gotten creative by going outside the usual utility channels to sign a 20-year power contract with The Ohio State University.\But much about Blue Creek is unconventional. Its operator, Iberdrola Renewables, also headquartered in Portland, Ore., was actually built without a power-purchase agreement in place.\""It was an enormous risk, but this company is financially strong so they decided to do it,"" said Dan Litchfield, Iberdrola's developer for Blue Creek.\""Certain companies will run projects without a PPA, but it's not something we'd consider. It's a different business model,"" Element's Zeimetz said.\Litchfield said Blue Creek was originally envisioned for Indiana, but Litchfield said he persuaded Iberdrola to move it across the state line to Ohio when this state's renewable portfolio standard was passed.\""I'm aware of efforts like that in other states that haven't succeeded,"" he said of Ohio's proposed RPS freeze, although one recently did succeed in Indiana. ""This is the fourth time in three years the Ohio law has been challenged.""\""It's a big concern,"" Zeimetz said of the legislation. ""But it's politics. It's a process, and we're optimistic both sides will come to some sort of agreement.""\State Sen. Troy Balderson, R-Zanesville, the lead sponsor of this latest effort to take on Ohio's renewable mandate, was not available for comment, according to his staff, which also didn't return a request for written comment.\FirstEnergy, an energy company based in Akron, recently distributed a letter to its customers opposing Ohio's RPS.\""Tell our elected leaders in Columbus to protect businesses and homeowners from the rising costs of Ohio's energy-efficiency mandates,"" the letter reads.\However, other local energy providers have found a way to work with renewable power sources like wind.\""AEP has a program where people can elect to receive electricity from renewable sources. It comes from out of state, but it's sometimes less than the regular AEP rate,"" said Sautter of Green Energy Ohio.\AEP's ECO-Advantage Electricity Plan offers customers options consisting of 100 percent wind energy at a fixed rate of 0.0719 cents per kilowatt hour, a savings of 0.003 cents per kilowatt hour each month.\""The potential for Ohio consumers to save money while supporting renewable energy is huge,"" AEP says on its website.\Sautter also took issue with the common complaint that power generated from wind farms may not be in highest demand in the isolated, rural locations where the turbines are usually located.\""Energy grid operators have the tools to shuffle things around to meet demand. They do that now when a major plant shuts down,"" she said.\In addition to Ohio's RPS, wind farms here, as well as nationwide, have until recently been eligible for a federal production tax credit, which provides a rebate of 2.2 cents per kilowatt hour over a wind farm's first 10 years of operation. The rebate can knock up to 30 percent off the cost of such a project. However, the PTC wasn't renewed by Congress at the end of 2013.\""You're not going to qualify if you're not already in the cycle. We're hopeful it will be re-established, but as far as any information on its progress I'm not certain any is available,"" Zeimetz said.\""If you find anyone with good information, I'd appreciate a call back.""\""In 10 or 15 years the economics are going to improve to the point where wind energy will be a no-brainer and we won't need these policies. But for the near future we do. It's only fair,"" Sautter said.\Black Fork plan\The planned Black Fork Wind Farm would be west of Shelby, north of Crestline and nearly surround the village of Tiro. Ohio 598 would bisect the entire site from north to south. The vast majority of the 91 turbines would be 494 feet high. The project is expected to generate up to 200 megawatts of power and have a life span of 20 to 25 years.\In addition to the turbines, the project includes access roads, electrical collection lines, a construction-staging area, concrete-batch plant, substation, and an operation and maintenance facility, all located on 14,800 acres of private land leased from 150 landowners who have signed agreements with Element Power. The entire project area would cover 24,000 acres.\Element Power also has to sign agreements with Richland and Crawford counties that would determine how local roads, many with low load limits, would be repaired by heavy equipment during construction or maintenance of the wind farm.\""We'll certainly need a road deal,"" Zeimetz said. ""We have a framework in place, but until we gain some traction with a utility and complete an actual agreement, we'll be holding off.""\thill3@nncogannett.com\419-521-7283\Twitter: @ToddHillMNJ\Other wind farms\The Black Fork, proposed for northern Crawford and Richland counties, is one of several wind farms in the early stages of development across north central Ohio.

229,"
Ohioans have seen their energy bills increase year after year, making it more difficult for those already struggling to get by in this fragile economic environment. Increases have come from a variety of federal regulations and mandates. Currently the Ohio Legislature is considering Senate Bill 310, which would delay a green energy mandate known as the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) for two years while a study is conducted to determine the program's effectiveness.
\
While a full repeal of the RPS would be best for Ohio, delaying the energy mandate is a step in the right direction. Passing SB 310 would bring much-needed relief for hardworking families and businesses on their electricity bills.
\
Under current law, Ohio utilities are forced to buy a certain percentage of their electricity from green sources, such as wind and solar. The law states that by 2025, 25 percent of energy must come from alternative sources, with half of that from renewables. While this may be appealing on paper, the real implications are not.
\
States across the country have ratified their own green energy mandates and have found the realities with such policies to be harsher than expected. The Manhattan Institute conducted a study on 29 states with green energy mandates. Their results raise serious concerns as they found between 2001 and 2010, states with RPS mandates saw faster electricity rate increases than non-RPS states. They also found that the average cost of residential electricity in 2010 for states with RPS was 31.9 percent higher than those without it. Businesses also took hits as commercial and industrial electricity costs were 27.4 percent and 30.7 percent higher.
\
Ohio is no exception. In fact, the impact of the RPS mandate in Ohio poses a greater threat than seen in other states. Currently, Ohioans and businesses are responsible for paying efficiency surcharges due to the green energy mandates. A recent filing by AEP-Ohio indicates that, as soon as August, AEP residential customers will have their mandate surcharge increased by 115 percent. Worse, those who use larger amounts of electricity can expect a colossal 391.6 percent surcharge hike. Duke customers can expect surcharge increases of 45 percent for residential while others will see a 25 percent increase.
\
Proponents of the mandate, who oppose SB 310, will make the misguided claim that anyone who disagrees with the mandate has no regard for the environment or renewable energy. This could not be further from the truth. The real issue with RPS is that it grants government authority to pick winners and losers and effectively distort a market. Moreover, such government mandates directly and negatively impact families' well-being.
\
While a full repeal of the RPS would be ideal, delaying it is the next best choice. The data indicate that, if the RPS isn't delayed, Ohioans will have to shoulder a great financial burden. The decision that Ohio lawmakers and Gov. John Kasich have to make is clear: Prioritize the well-being of Ohioans over the calls from special interests in the green energy industry by stopping government-mandated energy standards.
