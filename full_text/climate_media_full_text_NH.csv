On June 26, U.S. Reps. Carol Shea-Porter and Paul Hodes answered President Obama's call and helped pass the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill, which greatly increases energy taxes.
\
You will love this bill if you have the following problems: You don't pay enough for gasoline, heating fuel or electricity. Your cost of living is too low. Your total taxes are not high enough. You want a bigger, more expensive government.
\
The Wall Street Journal estimates that costs for the average family of four will ramp up to $1,800 per year in 2020 and to over $6,800 per year as all aspects of this bill are implemented.
\
This bill will destroy between 1.1 million to 2.7 million American jobs every year. Increased energy costs will drive American businesses, along with their jobs, overseas.
\
Claims that this bill will help the environment are false. Similar cap-and-trade schemes in Europe have not been beneficial. Moving American jobs overseas will increase CO2 production and total pollution because U.S. industry is clean compared to many others.
\
Shea-Porter and Hodes voted for a bill to raise your cost of living, destroy millions of American jobs, and increase pollution, most likely without even reading the bill. It is time to replace them with people who care about the well-being of their fellow Americans.

The U.S. Senate will soon vote on the 2008 Climate Security Act, a bill that institutes a cap-and-trade system to limit carbon dioxide emissions and allow polluters who reduce them below target levels to sell the right to pollute to others.
\
In the unlikely event that the bill passes, President Bush, who claims that capping emissions will harm the economy, will veto it. But bringing the bill up for a vote, even if it doesn't pass, will set the stage for real action to combat global warming when a new, environmentally re-sponsible president takes office.
\
A cap-and-trade system is far from the best way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. But it's the best that a Congress that depends on massive campaign contributions from the very polluters it's trying to control can do for now. And the need to act now is clear.
\
Last week, the U.S. Climate Change Science Program outlined the harm global warming is doing now to agriculture, weather and wildlife. That warning was followed by a peer-reviewed U.S. Department of Agriculture report that predicted that longer, more frequent draughts and temperature extremes would reduce yields of crops like corn and soybeans.
\
The details of the act are in flux, but in essence it sets emission targets and creates carbon allowances, some of which would be given to power plants, refineries and large industries and others that would be auctioned to the highest bidder. The money raised by selling the credits, says Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, a prime sponsor of the bill, would go to a ""private-public entity,"" the Climate Change Credit Corp., which would spend it ostensibly on measures that would further reduce global warming.
\
As Newsweek columnist Robert Samuelson recently pointed out, there are a host of flaws to this approach.
\
The act creates a huge new bureaucracy that will pick economic winners and losers. To win the support of senators from agricultural states, for example, the plan calls for allowing polluters to offset their emissions by paying farmers to plant trees or grow more crops without tilling the soil.
\
As carbon allowances grow scarce, their price will increase - as will the tax on energy users. Estimates of the amount of money the auctions will raise long term are in the trillions of dollars. Members of Congress love the thought of having all that money to dole out, money raised through a hidden tax on energy consumers. Lobbyists love the bill too, since they'll wind up with a substantial chunk of the revenue.
\
It's unclear how all that money will be spent. Will it be used to further subsidize the nuclear power industry or to help Americans who can't afford $5 per gallon heating oil or to insulate their homes? And who will lobby on behalf of poor homeowners?
\
A straight tax on carbon, as former vice president Al Gore argues, is a better approach. The tax could be revenue neutral - Gore suggests using it to replace the regressive payroll tax - or its revenue could be targeted to measures like insulating buildings and subsidizing clean sources of energy like solar and wind power.
\
In the current political climate, however, a carbon tax won't fly and a cap-and-trade system might. New Hampshire Sens. Judd Gregg and John Sununu should help Congress pass the act and show the world that the United States really is serious about protecting the environment by reducing its carbon footprint.

One notable result of the current antagonism between Republican Speaker Shawn Jasper and his nemesis, Bill O'Brien, is that Jasper's House Republican majority leadership team - in an attempt to unify their party and assert control over the legislative agenda - is looking for political issues on which they can make common cause with the rump O'Brien caucus. This effort is taking place on a broad range of issues, but nowhere is it more obvious or more alarming than with respect to House Republicans' current efforts to gut two of New Hampshire's signature environmental laws - the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and the Renewable Portfolio Standard.
\
RGGI
\
RGGI, a bipartisan multistate compact organized in 2007-8 by New York's then Republican Gov. George Pataki, has resulted in a 40 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions among nine participating Northeastern states from Maine to Maryland, including New Hampshire. It has also generated $20 million in economic growth in New Hampshire, largely in the form of new clean-energy jobs and energy cost savings, according to detailed studies by the Analysis Group. The most successful cap-and-trade clean air program since the campaign against acid rain, RGGI is seen by experts on both sides of the aisle as a model for market-based federal legislation to slow, if not reverse, the effects of global warming. Our participation in RGGI also means New Hampshire will likely not be required to take costly further measures to comply with the EPA's June 2 Clean Power Plan, which will impose new reductions in CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fueled generating plants.
\
On Jan. 22, five days after NASA and NOAA announced that 2014 was on average the warmest year since official record-keeping began in 1880, the House Science, Technology and Energy Committee held a public hearing on HB 208 in Representatives Hall at the State House in Concord. In its original form, the bill called for outright repeal of New Hampshire's participation in RGGI. Well more than 100 members of the public attended. Dozens spoke in opposition to RGGI repeal. Of the four who spoke in favor of the bill, two were members of the House Republican leadership, one was concerned about communist plots and the fourth was the director of Americans for Prosperity-New Hampshire, funded by the Koch brothers' oil and gas interests. His suggestions for an alternative to RGGI included building a new nuclear plant in New England, or having New Hampshire pull out of ISO-New England, the regional grid operator that keeps New England's lights on.
\
Realizing that the public would simply not tolerate outright repeal of RGGI, House Republican leaders later sponsored a fall-back amendment, which passed ST&E on a straight party-line vote. The bill that will come before the House tomorrow would preserve New Hampshire's participation in RGGI, but eliminate all state energy efficiency programs funded with RGGI revenues from the sale of emission ""allowances"" (each allowance is a permit to emit one ton of CO2), rebating all such funds to ratepayers in order to ""reduce electric rates."" Reducing electric rates would indeed be something to talk about, if HB 208 as amended would do that to any appreciable degree. But it won't.
\
RGGI allowances have recently sold for about $5 per ton of CO2. Current state law (RSA 125-O:23) provides that the first $1 of revenue from the sale of each RGGI allowance received by New Hampshire goes to energy efficiency programs coordinated by the Public Utilities Commission (programs that have been very successful in creating ""green jobs""), and that all such revenues in excess of $1 per allowance are rebated to retail electric ratepayers on a per-kilowatt-hour basis. PUC witnesses have testified that in 2014, RGGI energy efficiency programs funded by that ""first dollar"" totaled $3.487 million (the equivalent of 21 cents on an average residential customer's monthly electric bill of $125 for 650 kilowatt-hour), while the amounts in excess of the first dollar resulted in ratepayer rebates amounting to 83 cents per average monthly residential electric bill. In other words, eliminating the $1 of RGGI-funded energy-efficiency programs would reduce the average New Hampshire residential ratepayer's monthly electric bill by 21 cents - about enough for a stick of chewing gum. Meanwhile, PUC and DES witnesses and other experts testified that RGGI-funded energy efficiency programs (especially those targeted to low-income residents) would in fact be the most effective way to reduce retail electric rates over time, by reducing total demand for electricity in New Hampshire.
\
In the short-to-medium term (within four years), there is only one way to reduce New England retail electric rates significantly, and that is to increase the supply of natural gas delivered to the ""Dracut Hub"" during winter months, when tight supplies of natural gas are dedicated first to home heating requirements, and gas-fired electric generators have to pay much higher wholesale prices for natural gas because pipelines cannot currently provide enough supply.
\
Renewable Portfolio Standard
\
Longer term, what will keep a lid on retail electric prices is a combination of energy efficiency to reduce demand and the development of native renewable energy sources to increase supply. That brings us to the House Republican leadership's shortsighted attempts to gut New Hampshire's Renewable Portfolio Standard law, which requires New Hampshire utilities to obtain 25 percent of the power they sell to ratepayers from renewable energy sources by 2025.
\
Three bills introduced by various Jasper and O'Brien Republicans - HB 143, 234, and 543 - would either weaken or totally repeal New Hampshire's bipartisan efforts to reduce our reliance on out-of-state fossil fuels and encourage development of domestic renewable energy sources. HB 143 would swamp the market for Class 1 ""renewable energy credits"" by allowing large hydropower from Canada (which, unlike small domestic Class 1 sources, needs no public subsidies) to qualify for Class 1 REC's. HB 234 would collapse the current four classes of renewable energy sources qualifying for REC's into a single class. Either would effectively shut down New Hampshire's nascent renewable energy industry. And HB 543 would repeal the RPS statute altogether, effectively signaling that New Hampshire is quite happy to rely on federally subsidized out-of-state fossil fuels for the foreseeable future.
\
These three bills aimed at New Hampshire's RPS programs will be discussed in ST&E today and presumably debated on the House floor during the first week of March.
\
Let's not let RGGI and New Hampshire's Renewable Portfolio Standard become victims of the fractured Republican majority's attempt to score partisan political points based on arguments that fly in the face of overwhelming testimony from both experts and the public.

Legislators think state revenue will fall nearly $200 million short of expectations set in the current two-year budget, according to new numbers projected by the House yesterday. The numbers show New Hampshire residents are buying and selling less property than expected, are smoking fewer cigarettes and may be letting up on the gas. There is one levy expected to hold steady: the beer tax.
\
The new projections passed on a busy day when legislators gave final clearance to a regional greenhouse gas compact, agreed on a ban to the cremation alternative known as Resomation and set up House-Senate negotiations on the rollout of mandatory kindergarten and on overhauls to the shakily funded New Hampshire Retirement System. Members of the House also voted down an effort to revive debate on whether the president and vice president should be impeached.
\
Revenue is now expected to fall about $66 million short in the fiscal year that ends in June and $130 million short next year, according to new projections recommended by the House Ways and Means Committee and passed by the House, 194-77.
\
Tanking business taxes make the biggest losses to come, comprising about half of the shortfall next year, or nearly $60 million in fiscal year 2009, said Rep. Susan Almy, the Lebanon Democrat who chairs the committee.
\
But shortfalls are expected almost across the board over the two-year biennium.
\
The sluggish housing market is showing in real estate transfer taxes, which are now projected to sag $50 million short, with next year's shortfall slightly bigger than this year's.
\
Liquor sales are expected to fall $15 million short of expectations for the biennium.
\
Tobacco taxes are expected to bring in $30 million less than originally projected, a falloff Almy attributed not to a decline in smoking, but to smokers' disapproval of new fire-safe cigarettes and switching to other products, like mini-cigars and snuff, to avoid taxes.
\
Lottery tickets are expected to reel in $12.8 million less than expected for the education trust fund.
\
Soaring gas prices will have an unclear effect on the state's gas tax, a 19.6-cent levy paid for every gallon that goes primarily into the highway fund for road repairs, Almy said. Anticipating that drivers may cut back next year, the committee shaved $2 million off expectations for fiscal 2009.
\
A few taxes are holding roughly steady: The beer tax, the utility consumption tax and court fees are among them. Horse- and dog-racing revenue is is expected to surpass expectations, drawing in $200,000 more than the $6 million budget-writers anticipated.
\
Kindergarten
\
The details of the state's transition to universal, mandatory kindergarten will be negotiated by legislators in the House and Senate in the weeks to come. One key question remains: Will schools be allowed to contract with private kindergartens during the four-year transition phase?
\
The Senate voted yesterday to ask the House to negotiate a compromise on a bill that would give 12 towns that don't offer kindergarten another year to start programs.
\
The Legislature included public kindergarten as a requirement for all schools in the definition of an adequate education adopted last year. That law originally gave the 12 towns without kindergarten until September 2008 to offer programs.
\
The House and Senate agree the districts need more time, but they disagree on using private kindergarten programs as a substitute for programs provided in public schools. Both would give districts another year to start programs. The House also would give districts four years to contract with private providers as a transition to having their own programs.
\
Both would pay for temporary classrooms - the Senate for three years, the House for four.
\
Retirement
\
Despite intense pressure from unions, the House voted yesterday to insist on negotiations with the Senate on legislation overhauling the state's cash-strapped retirement system.
\
The New Hampshire Retirement Security Coalition - representing 70,000 active and retired public employees - lobbied for the House to agree with the Senate and send the bill on to Gov. John Lynch. The New Hampshire Municipal Association, which represents cities and towns, preferred the House version.
\
In the end, the House voted 205-100 yesterday to ask the Senate to confer. The two versions have the same immediate impact - stemming projected increases in employers' bills from 50 percent to about 15 percent - and both obtain savings by limiting increases to a medical subsidy that helps many public employees buy health insurance.
\
But the House makes longer-term changes, including halving the number of employee representatives on the board and extending the retirement age of police officers and firefighters from 45 to 50. Meanwhile, the Senate allows for bigger cost-of-living adjustments and sends $1,000 to all retirees who've worked for 15 years or less and collect a pension smaller than $20,000.
\
Critics of the House plan urged representatives to agree to the Senate's version as a better deal for workers. Manchester Democrat Daniel Sullivan argued the House's proposed changes went too far.
\
""What we have to do is stay the course and keep plugging away at this,"" he said.
\
But Rep. Ricia McMahon, a North Sutton Democrat who is a member of the retirement system's board, said the House version made long-term, necessary fixes.
\
""Stay the course is not good enough,"" she said. ""We have to steady the ship, and sometimes you have to avoid icebergs, and we need to do that now.""
\
The legislation continues work begun last year to shore up the $6 billion state retirement system. The plan is funded at 63 percent of its long-term liabilities, short by about $2.7 billion on its annuity fund alone. Benefits are also in poor shape: The health subsidy fund is about a half billion dollars short, and the fund that pays for cost-of-living adjustments is expected to run dry in a matter of years.
\
Resomation
\
The Legislature wants to overturn a new law allowing a new mortuary science that uses lye in hot water to dissolve bodies as an alternative to cremation.
\
The state Senate voted yesterday to send Gov. John Lynch a bill to reverse a 2-year-old law that allows Resomation - a process now used on human cadavers in only two places, the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Alkaline hydrolysis is legal in New Hampshire and Minnesota under cremation statutes.
\
The bill instead prohibits the process and establishes a committee to study how to regulate it. The committee must report to lawmakers by Nov. 1.
\
Asked if Lynch would sign the bill, spokesman Colin Manning said Lynch would ""be reviewing the bill.""
\
The Senate had adopted regulations, but the House balked at allowing the process. Some House members argued the process has not had a proper vetting. New Hampshire legalized the process in 2006 with a little-noticed sentence in a lengthy bill responding to a scandal at an unlicensed crematorium.
\
Greenhouse gases
\
New Hampshire is poised to become the 10th state to participate in a regional effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The House voted yesterday to send Gov. John Lynch legislation to implement the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative but to revisit it if Congress enacts a federal program. The House next considers changes made to the proposal, especially on how much money would go into a fund to promote energy efficiency.
\
The bill adds New Hampshire to the other New England states, New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland in a market-based, ""cap-and-trade"" program to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the region's power plants.
\
Lynch says the initiative will help New Hampshire's environment and economy.
\
""Cutting greenhouse gas pollution is the right thing to do for the health of our citizens, the health of our environment and the health of our economy. Joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative will allow New Hampshire to cut the emissions that contribute to global climate change, increase energy efficiency, and in the long term will help consumers save on energy costs,"" Lynch said in a statement.
\
Under RGGI, a regional carbon dioxide emissions cap would be put in place for large fossil-fuel-fired power plants beginning in 2009. Allowances would be issued equal to the total cap and apportioned to the participating states. Utilities would have to buy enough allowances within three years to cover their emissions. Since the number of allowances is limited by the regional cap, overall emissions are expected to be reduced.
\
The money utilities pay for the allowances would go into a state-regulated fund to improve energy efficiency. Money from the sale of allowances above a certain threshold would go back to electricity ratepayers.
\
The House proposed an initial threshold of $12 per ton, while the Senate set its 2009 mark at $6 per ton. The House voted to accept the Senate's threshold. Business groups had wanted the mark set at $2 per ton. The threshold rises over time in both versions to 2015. After 2015, all proceeds go into the fund.
\
Cigarette taxes
\
While the size of the state's budget shortfall is clear, it's not yet clear how legislators plan to fill it. Yesterday, the Senate voted to negotiate with the House over a plan to delay a cigarette tax increase proposed by the governor.
\
The House proposed delaying implementing the tax increase to attract smokers from other states to buy cigarettes at relatively bargain prices. The Senate voted yesterday to ask the House to negotiate a compromise over a bill that contains the tax.
\
The House version would delay a proposed 25-cent cigarette tax increase in hopes residents from other states, especially Massachusetts, will stock up on New Hampshire smokes. The House rejected a move to kill the tax increase altogether.
\
Under the House plan, New Hampshire's cigarette tax revenue would have to fall below $50 million between July 1 and Oct. 1 for the state's $1.08 tax to go up a quarter.
\
Poker
\
The New Hampshire House wants to talk with the Senate about its proposal to tax charity poker games.
\
The bill raises the maximum bet from $2 to $5.
\
A 3 percent tax would apply in tournaments where the playing chips have no monetary value. A 10 percent tax would apply if the chips had a monetary value.
\
The tax would bring in about $3.5 million a year. The state already gets a share of wagers on Bingo and Lucky Seven.
\
Highway plan
\
The New Hampshire House has voted to negotiate with the Senate a 10-year, $2.3 billion highway plan that cuts the current plan almost in half.
\
The House did not like amendments the Senate added, including authorization to borrow $80 million for school construction aid. The House had already rejected the borrowing in another bill.
\
The bill cut more than $2 billion in projects. Lawmakers estimated that funding for the pared-down plan would still fall short by $200 million, but they said the plan would be reviewed every two years to make adjustments.
\
The plan also endorsed a major shift from new construction to projects to preserve the current system and fix troubled bridges.
\
It would replace or fix 89 red-list bridges over 10 years, place a priority on sections of Interstate 93 that have the greatest safety and congestion problems, repair the Memorial Bridge in Portsmouth and widen the Spaulding Turnpike.
\
Sex offenders
\
State lawmakers are negotiating a compromise over a bill to establish a new system for classifying sex offenders and requirements for them to register after getting out of prison.
\
The bill creates a three-tier system for classifying sexual offenders and offenders against children. It recognizes that differences between sex crimes can vary from more minor offenses like indecent exposure to more serious offenses like child molestation and forcible rape.
\
For the most serious offenses, lifetime registration on the public list will be required, while for lesser offenses, the period can be shorter and the ability to petition off the list will be available in certain circumstances.
\
The Senate removed a House provision that would have required the state to collect DNA from all felons - instead requiring the samples to be taken from sex offenders and violent offenders. The Senate also refused to support publicly listing where sex offenders work. The Senate said that provision punished employers.
\
Child porn
\
Tough new sanctions on child pornography have passed both the House and the Senate, but they're at odds over whether regulations should apply to youths under the age of 18 or 16.
\
The House wants to include youths to age 18; the Senate proposes the lower age. The chambers have until May 30 to negotiate a compromise.
\
The difference is in a bill to strengthen the child pornography law by splitting it into three offenses: possession, distribution and manufacture. Each offense would carry enhanced penalties for repeat offenders.
\
The House also added a penalty for distributing pornographic material in violation of a court order or nondisclosure agreement.
\
People who use the internet to prey on children would face longer prison time under the bill. Repeat offenders who manufacture child pornography could face life in prison.

When it comes to building support among environmentalists, Republican Kelly Ayotte's Senate campaign has been tepid, at best.
\
Ayotte has questioned the science of manmade global warming and opposes a cap-and-trade energy policy. She has taken more than $72,000 in contributions from the oil and gas industry, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Her opponent, Democrat Paul Hodes, has sought to differentiate his environmental record from hers on drilling and renewable energy standards.
\
Yet a look at Ayotte's record as attorney general shows an office that was committed to environmental policy. Ayotte joined two multi-state lawsuits against the Environmental Protection Agency during President George W. Bush's administration. In both cases, Ayotte argued that the federal government was weakening environmental protection laws. She opposed a Republican-sponsored bill in 2005 that would have weakened the country's Clear Air Act. Ayotte's office pursued major cases involving air and water pollution.
\
Ayotte has spent most of her campaign focused on spending and the economy. But she said she is proud of her environmental record. ""Common sense environmental protection preserves New Hampshire's quality of life as well as the state's economic competitiveness,"" Ayotte said. ""I am proud of my strong record of environmental protection from my time as attorney general.""
\
Jennifer Patterson, chief of the attorney general's office's Environmental Protection Bureau from 2001 to 2007, said Ayotte was ""reasonably involved"" in deciding which cases to pursue. ""When we'd sign onto lawsuits that were being brought in conjunction with other states, obviously she was involved with it,"" Patterson said.
\
The difference between Ayotte's positions as attorney general and as a candidate has bothered at least one activist. Jan Pendlebury worked with Ayotte and her office on environmental policy as the New Hampshire representative for the National Environmental Trust.
\
""I found Kelly Ayotte to be a different person than she is now,"" Pendlebury said.
\
Pendlebury worked with her office regarding a variety of environmental issues. She said Ayotte and her staff were knowledgeable, accommodating, gave good advice and were committed to the issues. Now, Pendlebury said she is disturbed by Ayotte's comments on climate change.
\
""I just really feel sad when somebody decides they want to run for elected office, it seems they abandon their values and adopt whatever platform the national party tells them to adopt,"" Pendlebury said.
\
Climate change
\
As a Senate candidate, Ayotte has said she supports the development of renewable energy and clean energy technology and understands the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But many of her positions have put her at odds with environmental advocates. Ayotte opposes cap-and-trade legislation, which would establish a cap on carbon emissions and force companies to buy credits to discharge emissions. Ayotte, like many Republicans, calls it an ""energy tax"" and says it will make the U.S. less competitive.
\
She signed a ""No Climate Tax"" pledge put out by the group Americans for Prosperity committing to ""oppose any legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in government revenue."" She supports ""responsible drilling"" for oil and expanded nuclear power.
\
""We can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make our environment cleaner without destroying America's global economic competitiveness,"" Ayotte said. ""We can't allow special interests from the left to use this issue to pass massive 'cap and trade' legislation that hikes taxes, raises energy costs and ultimately harms our economy.""
\
Ayotte said during the campaign that she would support ""reining in"" the role of the EPA. Asked another time if manmade global warming has been proven without a doubt, Ayotte said no. In another debate, she said scientific evidence has shown that human activity could have contributed to higher temperatures.
\
Catherine Corkery, chapter director of the Sierra Club, said the group has endorsed Hodes because of his support for reducing carbon emissions, for trying to deal with global warming and for setting fuel economy standards for buses and trucks.
\
But Ayotte has recognized the importance of climate change in the past. In a 2005 letter to a Senate committee signed by Ayotte and 12 other attorneys general, the group wrote that they opposed the Clear Skies Act of 2005 because it ignored global climate change.
\
""The Senate should act now to address the devastating effects of global climate change,"" the attorneys general wrote. They said that to address climate change, power plant owners needed to cut carbon dioxide emissions. ""The bill's failure to impose any limitation on carbon dioxide emissions constitutes a glaring failure to confront an enormous problem,"" they wrote.
\
The bill was one of several Republican-sponsored bills under Bush dealing with the Clean Air Act. A 2005 statement by the New Hampshire chapter of the National Environmental Trust said the bill ""includes new loopholes that weaken the Clean Air Act and allow increases in emissions of mercury, arsenic, lead, and other toxic chemicals from a wide range of industrial facilities.""
\
The attorneys general wrote that the proposed pollution cuts in the bill would be too little, too late, that the bill would repeal anti-pollution enforcement tools, would weaken standards on mercury emissions and would exempt certain industrial boilers.
\
Mercury emissions
\
That was not the only Bush-era environmental policy Ayotte opposed. In June 2004, Ayotte - then acting attorney general - and state Environmental Services Commissioner Michael Nolin submitted comments to the Environmental Protection Agency opposing a federal plan for a cap-and-trade system to regulate mercury. In March and May 2005, the state sued the EPA in two related cases for adopting the mercury rule. The second lawsuit was filed by 11 states.
\
The states wanted the EPA to set specific mercury emissions standards for every coal- and oil-fired power plant. The EPA proposed standards that most power plants could meet without installing additional pollution controls. The EPA would set a cap for mercury emissions nationwide and allow plants to trade emissions credits. Ayotte and the other states argued that cap-and-trade was not an appropriate tool for regulating mercury, since it would not help the problem of local ""hot spots"" around plants that buy emissions credits.
\
The issue had particular resonance in Hew Hampshire. A 2007 study found one of the worst hotspots in the Northeast was in southern New Hampshire, including an intense deposit near Concord. Joel Harrington, then-vice president of the Audubon Society, said all New Hampshire's public water bodies had fish advisories warning about the presence of mercury.
\
""Our lakes became the canary in the coal mine,"" Harrington said. ""They were an indication there was a bigger problem, and why a number of states in the Northeast were interested in pursuing real changes in federal policy."" About 2006, while the federal lawsuit was pending, the state Legislature passed an aggressive mercury reduction policy.
\
The EPA mercury rules were thrown out by a federal appeals court judge in 2008, and the EPA is currently developing new standards for toxic emissions from power plants.
\
The debate over cap-and-trade for mercury is not the same as the cap-and-trade debate today over carbon emissions. Pendlebury said mercury is considered a dangerous neurotoxin that can hurt individuals locally and must be eliminated at its source, while carbon is harmful because of its global cumulative effect.
\
More litigation
\
Ayotte's office opposed another EPA rule in 2006 and 2007, when New Hampshire joined 11 other states in suing the EPA to stop it from reducing public access to information on toxic chemical releases. The federal government's Toxics Release Inventory program requires industries that emit toxic chemicals above a certain amount to file an annual public report. The rule change increased the reporting threshold for chemicals - including some of the most dangerous ones - to the point that many chemicals would no longer be reported at all.
\
Ayotte called the new rules ""illegal and counterproductive to full public disclosure of toxic releases,"" and said they would hurt state and local efforts to protect citizens from toxic releases by reducing public access to information.
\
New Hampshire also joined other states on several smaller suits. In 2005, for example, New Hampshire joined 13 states demanding that the U.S. Department of Energy update its energy efficiency standards for appliances. The following year, New Hampshire and 12 states sued the EPA for failing to strengthen air quality standards.
\
Ayotte's office also took an active role in prosecuting several major cases that were started in previous years. After seven years of litigation, the attorney general's office joined a 2007 settlement in a case regarding air pollution from Midwestern coal-fired power plants, which was affecting the Northeast. New Hampshire received $1.2 million from American Electric Power to use for environmental projects.
\
Her office also continued prosecuting a statewide case against oil companies for polluting state waters with MtBE, an additive used in gasoline. The suit was started in 2003 and has gone back and forth between state and federal courts. It is still pending. One local environmental lobbyist said Ayotte's office vigorously pursued violations of the Shoreland Protection Act - against those who cut down trees or built boathouses improperly.
\
Typically, the decision to get involved in a lawsuit lies with the attorney general's office, not the governor's office. And some cases spanned several governors. Criticism of the EPA mercury rules started when Republican Craig Benson was governor, and the lawsuit was filed under Democratic Gov. John Lynch.
\
It is difficult to know how involved Ayotte was personally since those who worked most closely with her would not talk to the media. Patterson said often the multi-state lawsuits were submitted through the National Association of Attorneys General and went through an internal review process which ""certainly included the front office.""
\
Robert Varney, a former New Hampshire environmental services commissioner, worked as regional administrator for the EPA during Ayotte's tenure as attorney general. ""She was fairly active on environmental issues,"" Varney said of Ayotte. Though the multi-state lawsuits were handled in Washington, Varney said he worked with the attorney general's office on issues such as energy efficiency and enforcing environmental laws.
\
Several environmental activists said they dealt more with the Department of Environmental Services than the attorney general's office. Department of Environmental Services spokesman Jim Martin referred questions to the attorney general's office.
\
But even activists who had concerns about Ayotte said they are mostly worried about what she has said on the campaign trail. None of them criticized her record as attorney general.

All this discussion of the potential discharge to the environment of 24 pounds of mercury a year from a wood-fired power plant - why, the Concord sewage treatment plant has been annually discharging about 17 pounds of mercury to the environment for years with no hullabaloo!
\
How? In 2002, the Legislature directed sewage treatment plants to measure the toxic content of sewage sludge land-applied in farmers' fields and elsewhere. Concord had a measured value of 4.4 milligrams of mercury per kilogram (4.4 parts per million).
\
The Hall Street plant generates about 2,000 tons a year of dry sewage sludge (sometimes known by the more appealing name of ""biosolids""). Instead of incinerating it like Manchester or landfilling it like Keene, Berlin, Littleton and Somersworth, Concord dumps it back on the land.
\
Okay, says the Department of Environmental Services, until it reaches five pounds of mercury, 178 pounds of lead and nine pounds of arsenic per acre. NHDES never says what future use can be made of this land. It certainly can't be used by organic farmers!
\
There are 14 New Hampshire and several Vermont sewage treatment plants doing this in New Hampshire. Add it up!
\
So, how does the Legislature respond to this pollution of the land and water? For political expediency, it has proposed House Bill 722, which allows spreading of sewage sludge within 35 feet of surface waters even though the attorney general previously advised that any land spreading closer than 250 feet was illegal!
\
And, oh yes, while we're at it, soil measurements at Hooksett (directly downwind from the Bow power plant) showed no mercury increase from 1988 to 1998. Most of the mercury deposited in New Hampshire lakes and steams comes from Midwest power plants (and probably from land-applied sewage sludge adjacent to rivers, lakes and streams) and would be reduced by cap and trade proposals that encourage installation of mercury reduction systems there, not here.
\
The primary beneficiaries from mercury reduction at PSNH-Bow will be Maine, the Maritimes and the Atlantic Ocean.

7,"Monitor staff \One of the region's highest-profile, and some say most successful, efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions will be the topic of discussion today, as the public is being asked to suggest changes to the program known as RGGI.\The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the nation's first mandatory cap-and-trade program involving carbon dioxide emitted by electricity production, is undergoing an every-four-years policy review in its nine participating states.\A coalition of New Hampshire environmental groups is collecting suggestions about possible changes, and are holding what they call a People's Hearing at UNH Law School in Concord today.\The event starts at 5:30 p.m. with presentations from energy experts from Ceres and The Acadia Center. It is free and open to everybody.\Sponsoring organizations include Environment New Hampshire, League of Conservation Voters, National Wildlife Federation, Mom's Clean Air Force, Toxics Action Center, Union of Concerned Scientists, and New Hampshire Sierra Club.\These groups generally argue that the levels of CO2 allowed under RGGI should be reduced more quickly than is currently planned, and that New Hampshire should use all of the money paid by electric utilities under RGGI to increase energy efficiency programs; some of it is currently used to lower electric rates.\The meeting will be held in Room 200 of the Law School at 2 White St. in Concord.\"
8,"The self-contradictions are catching up with the Obama administration. We will be transparent, they said. Only they aren't. We will be accountable. Anything but. You will find us nonpartisan and above politics as usual, they insisted. Hardly.\The job offer to keep Rep. Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania out of a Senate primary is instructive on this score.\While it may be more a mouse's squeak than a lion's roar as scandals go, the administration dodged questions about it for months and then finally put out a memo so vaguely worded as to arouse still more suspicion. That's a far cry from transparency, and about the only excuse for the approach to Sestak -- which seems pretty clearly illegal -- is that everyone does it and always has.\True enough and reason enough for Republicans to back off calls for a special prosecutor. But at least a few citizens may be trying to recall which of President Obama's campaign speeches promised that his White House would get the job done when it came to tawdriness typical of D.C. politicians.\Something that is a lion's roar is the Gulf oil spill. Obama's idea of leadership has seemed mainly to consist of deflecting any thought that any of this was his fault.\The government go-ahead to drill was given on his watch in disregard of a federal law requiring still another permit assessing the threat to the environment. But Obama has mostly pointed to the regulating agency's questionable practices before he became President and recently made an announcement about a criminal investigation of BP. That probe -- at this point, while efforts are still under way to stop the spill -- is politics meant to make him look tough while he sidesteps accountability.\In full-partisan fervor that is seldom far from his lips, he also has attacked Republicans in general as opposing regulation, when, in fact, almost everyone recognizes the need for some regulations of particular kinds.\It is true that he did say in one of his rare full-scale press conferences that he would take responsibility for there being ""insufficient urgency"" in changing the ""culture"" of the government agency that regulates the drilling. Excuse me, but the way you change the culture is to require employees to henceforth do what the law requires them to do and set up a system of checks to make sure it is done. That can happen in, oh, one day.\By the way, for a glance at real leadership on the spill, look at Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. He did not just ask but practically demanded a slow-moving, seemingly recalcitrant federal government have BP build sand barriers to protect wetlands from oil slicks, and he won his way.\Another lion's roar was the health bill that was rushed through Congress with insufficient analysis and few people knowing exactly what it would do. We're learning more everyday, as is noted in an article by Michael Tanner of the Cato Institute.\Citing such sources as the RAND Corp., the Office of the Chief Actuary and the Congressional Budget Office, he notes a number of recent findings. The law will hike health insurance premiums for young people. It could force as many as 10 million people to have to change their insurance. It will lead to $311 billion more spending on health care every 10 years. It may cause the closing of many hospitals. Middle- class taxpayers may end up paying $1,000 more each year in taxes.\That's not the end of it, of course, because businesses are going to be hit, too, and are trying to figure out what the costs to them might be. Some have suggested that the uncertainties here -- along with the uncertainty of possibly getting a cap-and-trade tax and of not knowing what the government's accumulating debt might mean to the economy -- are slowing down business expansion and the rehiring of people even as the recession shows signs of lifting.\The public is increasingly disenchanted with President Obama these days, and here is what I'd suggest he do. Heed his campaign rhetoric.\.\Jay Ambrose is a columnist living in Colorado. He can be reached at SpeaktoJay@aol.com."
9,"New Hampshire Union Leader\CONCORD -- Calling the changes ""extensive"" and ""historic,"" Republican House leaders gave themselves strong marks Tuesday in a report on the 2011 legislative session.\Speaker William O'Brien R-Mont Vernon, said Republican lawmakers received a mandate from the voters of New Hampshire in November to cut state spending and through their votes have kept their promises.\Counting off more than 30 bills passed in the House this session and now headed to the Senate, including a budget which does not increase taxes and fees and uses ""realistic revenue projections,"" he said the focus will continue to be on reducing burdens and improving a business climate while ensuring there would be no new taxes.\But Harrell Kirstein, press secretary for the Democratic Party said it was just another rally for Republicans around ""phony accomplishments"" and noted that it was the first time that Republican Finance Chair Ken Weyler, R-Kingston, admitted that the Republicans have raised $200 million in new taxes.\""It was a bombshell"" Kirstein said, noting that Weyler indicated during the noon press conference in the Legislative Office Building about $115 million would come from keeping the hospital ""bed tax"" that is usually returned and $80 million in increases in public employee salary contributions towards pensions.\""That is going to increase the cost of health care for all citizens,"" which could eventually lead to job loss for hospital employees.\Republicans who hold a majority in the House saw much to be pleased with, listing off more than 30 bills which have been passed on to the Senate for consideration.\O'Brien noted that the change includes passing a Constitutional amendment to require a super majority in the House and Senate to raise taxes or borrowing under CACR 6; passing a Constitutional amendment to expand local control of education funding by returning authority to elected officials, rather than ""unelected judges""; and ""no new taxes.""\The report did not mention that thousands of protesters came to the State House last week to decry budget cuts they said would negatively impact the state's most vulnerable residents -- in health care, education and services for the needy.\Republican leadership has defended the House Finance Committee as doing a thorough job to meet the state's needs while mindful of the need to reduce spending.\State Rep. Gene Chandler R-Bartlett, speaker pro-tem, said no citizen should be surprised at what the House has done in passing measures to cut the budget.\""It is what the Republicans campaigned on, and what they said they would do,"" Chandler said.\House Majority Leader David J. Bettencourt, said from the day after election ""the focus has remained steadfast on a multi-faceted agenda that I told you about in January would be ambitious and far-reaching. And we have worked to make sure we have moved our economy forward, create jobs and put an 'Open for Business' sign back out on the State of New Hampshire.""\But he noted that jobs don't materialize overnight. Measures just passed are aimed at creating an environment for those jobs to be created.\Included in the successes he said were a cigarette tax reduction, a small business tax cut to protect reasonable compensation from the business profits tax, and work to reduce electricity costs by repealing the state's cap and trade program.\""Our right-to-work legislation will hopefully expand opportunities to attract employers to New Hampshire which will bring even more employers to our state,"" Bettencourt said.\""Our citizens have been over-licensed and our businesses over burdened and because of this our businesses have struggled to stay afloat over the last four years,"" Bettencourt said. ""New Hampshire's Legislature has listened to the people.""\The Republication report also congratulated itself on passing measures which improve government transparency, protect rights of citizens to protect themselves and be notified if their child seeks an abortion and to repeal aspects of Senate Bill 500, which allow for early release of prisoners and gives the parole board more discretion."
10,".Second try: Bill would repeal the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.\CONCORD -- Repealing the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative would hurt the state's economy, its environment and residents' health, opponents of the repeal said Tuesday.\Unlike a year ago, when repealing the emissions cap and trade program drew several hundred people, only about 50 attended the public hearing on House Bill 1490 Tuesday, almost all opposed to the repeal.\Last year the House overwhelmingly passed a bill to repeal the state's participation in the 10-state carbon emissions reduction initiative, but the Senate instead modified the program. The two sides couldn't agree and the bill died only to be resurrected, approved and vetoed, but the Senate failed to override the veto.\Opponents of repeal say the program works, providing $34 million for energy conservation and efficiency projects while reducing air pollution.\""This Legislature seems to think it's more important whether children stand for the Pledge of Allegiance rather than if they can breath clean air,"" said Ian Raymond, the chair of the Sanbornton energy committee.\But opponents say RGGI raises electric rates and is an income redistribution ploy rewarding some of the state's most successful businesses.\The bill does have the backing of the House leadership, as Majority Leader D.J. Bettencourt, R-Salem, signed on in favor.\HB 1490 would repeal RGGI beginning Jan. 1, 2015, when the program's second compliance period ends. Under the bill, the state's emissions cap would be lowered by 2.5 percent from 8.6 million tons a year to 8.4 million, and generators exceeding their historic emissions limits would be fined rather than required to purchase allowances for additional emissions.\The bill would give the five fossil-fuel generating plants the allowances they need to emit their historic levels of carbon dioxide, meaning much of the money generated by the program would no longer be available.\The weak economy and low cost of natural gas have reduced the region's emissions to below the regional cap for the past several years, which reduces the value of the allowances generators would have to buy.\Last year, the House Science, Technology and Energy Committee voted overwhelmingly to repeal RGGI. Committee chair, Rep. James Garrity, R-Atkinson, said Tuesday this year's proposal tries to change the program so it is more neutral to ratepayers.\After several speakers opposed the bill, he asked those testifying if they could support the bill if the repeal provision was removed, and some said they could but most said they would need to review the other provisions.\Jane Doherty of Goffstown served on a working group for the Public Utilities Commission to design energy efficiency programs and opposed the bill.\""Our membership in RGGI is a good bargain for us Yankees,"" she told the committee. ""This program saves real dollars. The bottom line is it makes us less dependent on foreign oil.""\Others suggested the bill has created jobs, particularly through making residences more energy efficient, and helped improve the state's economy.\""With the passage of RGGI, New Hampshire became a national clean energy leader,"" noted Jessica O'Hare, advocate for the statewide environmental group, Environment New Hampshire. ""RGGI is good for New Hampshire's environment, creating jobs, and saving local residents and businesses money on their utility bill--a triple win for Granite Staters.""\Others said the state could withdraw from the program but consumers would still be paying the costs of RGGI because the costs are embedded in the wholesale price of electricity on the New England power grid. ""We are not an island,"" said Mike Fitzgerald, of the Division of Air Resources. He said New Hampshire's economy is better off because of the program, which benefits all state users.\Paul Hibbard of the Analysis Group, did an economic study of the program's effect in the Northeast. He said the program has reduced electric costs for the region, generating more than $1 billion in savings and creating thousands of jobs.\John Mann, Alstead energy committee member, criticized the attempt to repeal the program as driven by national organizations.\He said cap and trade is 10 times more effective at reducing carbon dioxide pollution than other methods. He said the state cannot wait 30 years to begin addressing pollution.\The committee did not make an immediate recommendation on the bill.\[Caption]\Credit: By GARRY RAYNO New Hampshire Union Leader"

As the U.S. Senate considers establishing a national standard for renewable electricity, the debate is spilling over into New Hampshire's Senate race.
\
At a press conference yesterday, Democratic U.S. Rep. Paul Hodes, a candidate for Senate, called for a national renewable energy standard that he said would reduce carbon emissions and save jobs. ""A national energy standard would require our major utilities to get a certain percentage of their electricity from renewable sources - wind, solar, biomass, which means wood,"" Hodes said. ""In New Hampshire, we have two wood-fired power plants. In New Hampshire, we get it. Kelly Ayotte doesn't.""
\
Ayotte spokesman Jeff Grappone said Ayotte, a Republican, does care about renewable energy. ""Kelly wants to see a cleaner environment, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions,"" Grappone said. ""She's frequently emphasized on the campaign trail that we need to expand renewable energy sources like biomass, wind and solar.""
\
Ayotte was noncommittal on the Senate bill, however.
\
""As America makes plans for a clean energy future, Kelly also wants to see more nuclear power, which produces zero emissions,"" Grappone said. ""Nuclear is not included in the new bill that's pending.""
\
Last week, a bipartisan group of senators led by New Mexico Democrat Jeff Bingaman and Kansas Republican Sam Brownback introduced a bill that would create a Renewable Electricity Standard requiring utilities that sell electricity to obtain a percentage of their electricity from renewable sources. The percentage would increase gradually, reaching 15 percent by 2021. Renewable energy includes wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and other forms of power that come from natural sources.
\
Four Republicans joined 22 Democrats - including New Hampshire U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen - in co-sponsoring the bill.
\
The bill could be the last chance for Congress to pass some energy legislation before the November election. The House previously passed a comprehensive clean energy bill that includes national standards for renewable energy, a cap-and-trade policy, energy efficiency incentives for homes and more. The Senate introduced its own comprehensive clean energy legislation but has been unable to get the 60 votes required to pass it.
\
As a result, Senate leaders took language from its energy bill that addressed renewable electricity standards and introduced it as a separate standalone bill, with the hope that it will have enough Republican support to pass. The House already approved its own renewable electricity standard bill, so if the Senate bill passes, it will go to a conference committee where legislators will try to agree on a final version.
\
The bill would not have a major impact on New Hampshire, which already has more stringent standards than those in the proposed federal bill. In 2007, with bipartisan support, New Hampshire adopted a state law requiring its electric utilities to get 23.8 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2025. (Today, New Hampshire gets 15 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, according to the Office of Energy and Planning.) The governor has also signed onto a policy requiring that 25 percent of all energy used in New Hampshire - not just electricity - come from renewable sources by 2025.
\
At his press conference, Hodes challenged Ayotte to support a national renewable energy standard. Hodes pointed out that New Hampshire is already a leader on the issue, as one of 28 states with mandatory standards for renewable energy. ""I support a renewable energy standard,"" Hodes said. ""Kelly Ayotte hasn't said where she stands on that important issue.""
\
Hodes said he supports the current Senate bill, though he would prefer to see a stronger one. ""Because we couldn't move through the Senate an aggressive clean energy and environment bill, this seems to be the last hope this term to begin the necessary transition,"" Hodes said.
\
Hodes said he believes a national renewable energy standard is important to create jobs, including jobs in biomass in New Hampshire, and to reduce carbon emissions. ""It's a crucial step in efforts to address global warming,"" Hodes said.
\
Hodes talked for less than 10 minutes and spent much of his time attacking Ayotte for her positions on global warming and climate change. ""If you don't believe in global warming, you deny the science, you don't really care about reducing carbon emissions, you don't think action's necessary,"" Hodes said. ""That's Kelly Ayotte's position. She's wrong.""
\
Ayotte responded by accusing Hodes of distorting her record and criticizing Hodes for supporting a cap-and-trade policy that she called ""a massive national energy tax for consumers.""
\
She did not directly address the renewable energy standards bill.
\
Several environmental activists - including a group from the Sierra Club - attended Hodes's event. Jan Pendlebury of the Pew Environment Group said the group appreciates Hodes's work on environmental issues, and believes renewable energy standards are important. ""It's no longer a debate if global warming is happening,"" Pendlebury said. ""And relying on foreign fuels is a national security risk.""
\
Evan Carlson, spokesman for the clean energy advocacy group Repower America, said his group cannot endorse political candidates. But Carlson said having a national renewable energy standard is a step in the right direction, which must be coupled with clean car technology, cap and trade and other clean energy policies. ""It's something we need to get done as part of a larger effort to transition to a clean energy economy,"" Carlson said.
\
Among New Hampshire's current Senate delegation, Shaheen co-sponsored the current Senate bill and a bill that would require a stronger standard of 25 percent by 2025. Shaheen said having a national Renewable Electricity Standard would create U.S. jobs and make the U.S. a leader in the global clean energy industry.
\
""As New Hampshire has demonstrated, a strong Renewable Electricity Standard is good for the economy,"" Shaheen said in a statement. ""Our state adopted one of the nation's most aggressive standards three years ago, which has spurred private investment and helped create good jobs in our communities.""
\
Republican Sen. Judd Gregg has previously supported legislation to address climate change and curb greenhouse gas emissions. Gregg told CongressDaily last week that he would consider supporting the current bill - though he dismissed the idea that the Senate would take the time or the political will to pass it this year.

When Michael Morrison flew to Greenland in 1989 as the scientific coordinator of a University of New Hampshire project to drill deep into the glacial ice cap, he didn't know what he would find. After drilling more than 3,000 meters down through solidified snow that had collected over millennia, and analyzing the ice like tree rings, the story it told was disturbing.
\
The last ice age came to an end over three years, Morrison said, not 70, as prior research had indicated. The natural environment, it turned out, was not as stable as scientists had thought. Sudden, extreme changes in world climate have happened before.
\
""It took this sort of vague, fuzzy picture that we had sort of had,"" Morrison said, as he told the story over coffee at a Manchester conference yesterday that was convened by an environmental organization, Clean Air Cool Planet, ""and it snapped it into relief.""
\
Eighteen years later, mainstream opinion has confirmed that the climate change is happening, and is triggered by human actions. The Intergovernmental Climate Change Committee released a report in April 2007 linking manmade pollution to climate change, and outlined likely results.
\
Business, advocacy, and political actors joined presidential candidates at the conference yesterday in what an organizer called an example of the ""Big Tent"" theory in action: Get interested stakeholders together, and let them learn from each other.
\
At the conference, Gov. John Lynch outlined the importance of the environment to New Hampshire's economy, and he spoke about the effects global warming has already had in the state.
\
""The increase of the intensity of storm events, fewer days with snow cover, earlier spring blooming of some plants, and earlier flowing spring flows from our rivers and from our streams,"" Lynch said.
\
""I think we really need national leadership on the issue of global warming and climate change, and we haven't seen it,"" he said later.
\
Bill Richardson outlined his energy plan yesterday afternoon, and John McCain, Dennis Kucinich, and Mike Huckabee are scheduled to speak today. Many speakers rejoiced after Al Gore's winning of the Nobel Peace Prize Thursday night.
\
There was Alex Lee, who passed out tiny lapel clothespins. He started a group called Project Laundry List, to try to get people to drip dry clothes rather than use electric driers, which he said are responsible for five to ten percent of residential energy consumption in the country.
\
Dick Henry, who heads The Jordan Institute in Concord, a group that works to improve the efficiency of buildings, has been working on climate change issues for the past 30 years. He said he was impressed with the turnout.
\
""It's nice seeing leading corporations,"" said Henry, ""asking some of these difficult questions of themselves and not being afraid of what they find. We all need to do that in our own lives.""
\
He spoke after attending a panel where executives from Stonyfield Farms and Timberland Co. spoke about changes to the way they do business, such as refining the supply chain and distribution networks in an attempt to lower the harmful impact of their profits on the environment. Throughout the day, there was an emphasis on how smarter energy policy could benefit, not constrain business.
\
The keynote address was by a power company executive, Ralph Izzo, of Public Services Enterprise Group.
\
""Over the next forty years or so, we need to cut green house gas emissions by 80 percent,"" Izzo said.
\
He said that the time has come for the federal government take a firmer stance against global warming, by setting in place an incentive system to force polluters to curb their behavior.
\
""We strongly support federal cap-and-trade legislation that will require mandatory greenhouse gas reductions,"" he said.
\
Governors in the northeast have already signed a regional commitment to work towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions, called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, that would work as a cap-and-trade mechanism. Under this effort, Gov. John Lynch has said that he will support legislation to set a limit on emissions, with a market-based trading system. He reiterated this commitment yesterday, and announced the creation of a climate change task force, to report back to him on Aug. 1, 2008.
\
After lunch, Morrison recounted his Arctic research to a younger environmentalist, Adam Clark, of Northeast Resource Recovery Association in Epsom. Together, they talked about how to move forward.
\
""The science is done,"" said Morrison, who took a three-day seminar led by Al Gore last April. ""The call of the day is motivating and educating people.""

13,"The most important question I am asked when campaigning throughout New Hampshire's 1st District is: How can the government create jobs?\The answer: Government cannot truly create jobs, especially any jobs that are productive and sustainable. What the government can and should do is create an environment that incentivizes private companies and makes it easier to hire new people.\Spending large sums of taxpayer money doesn't create sustainable jobs. Most of the stimulus-funded jobs are temporary and will disappear when the federal money runs out. Those are not the kinds of jobs we lost; and that is not the kind of job growth we need.\Instead, I believe there are four ways for the federal government to stimulate private-sector job growth without spending our children into debt or creating short-lived, government-sponsored employment.\First, lawmakers need to realize that companies are not investing and creating new jobs because of the uncertainty that exists in the tax and regulatory environment in Washington. The Democrats in Congress have been proposing new, onerous regulatory burdens like federal health care mandates, cap-and-trade and financial rules that have huge implications and give companies pause before they are willing to commit capital, invest in equipment and technology, and hire new workers. Washington needs to stop the rhetoric and the radical changes to the regulatory landscape so that businesses can have greater confidence in the future and invest accordingly.\Uncertainty also affects business lending, which is vital to the small- and medium-sized companies that make up the backbone of our economy. A significant challenge to small businesses during this recession was the evaporation of existing credit lines. An uncertain regulatory environment discourages community and regional banks from providing credit and, in turn, hurts a company's ability to grow. Small businesses that are supported locally will lead us out of the recession by hiring new workers and growing faster than the overall economy.\Second, American companies are at a disadvantage when it comes to taxes. We have the second-highest corporate tax rates in the industrialized world -- only slightly behind Japan, a country whose economy has been stagnant for almost 20 years. U.S. companies are forced to fight with one hand tied behind their backs because they pay such a high marginal tax rate compared to their foreign competitors in places like France, Italy, the United Kingdom or Denmark. If the federal government lowered marginal corporate tax rates, companies would be able to invest more capital, create more jobs and increase payrolls. This also would generate more federal revenue without raising tax rates and would lower costs, like unemployment benefits, because more people would be working.\Third, the federal government would help the private sector reach new markets and create jobs by approving free trade agreements with countries like Colombia and South Korea. Right now, Colombian companies can export goods to the United States and pay almost no tariffs, even without a free trade agreement in place, but U.S. companies pay punitive tariffs to sell goods to Colombia and are losing market share to companies in Canada and Europe. We need to open up trade and lower barriers so that American businesses can export more and create more jobs here at home.\Lastly, and critically, the federal government needs to get its budget under control. Doing so will help grow the economy and lead to job creation. Not taking action leaves our nation's debt on a path to exceed 90 percent of its gross domestic product by 2020. Our current debt is approximately 60 percent, which is dangerously high. We have not seen such a level since World War II, and the likely result will be slowed economic growth and higher interest rates.\As the federal government issues more and more debt every year because it can't balance its budget, the private sector may be crowded out of the debt markets, making it harder for companies to access the capital they need to grow. We have to get our spending under control now.\Over the past 17 years, I've worked for New Hampshire's largest manufacturer and one of its top private employers to promote an economic climate that empowers business and enables job growth. This firsthand experience has taught me that the government doesn't create jobs, businesses do. Lawmakers in Congress need to learn this lesson, get out of the way and unleash the power of private enterprise that will put people back to work.\Regulatory certainty, lower taxes, free trade, access to capital and deficit reduction will encourage private enterprise to invest, innovate, hire and grow our economy. That is what the federal government can and should do to fix the unemployment problem in America today.\.\Rich Ashooh of Bedford is a Republican candidate for Congress in New Hampshire's 1st District. He is a former executive at BAE Systems in Nashua."
14,"U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte bucked most of her Republican colleagues on Wednesday and supported a Democratic-authored resolution that declares that climate change is real and ""human activity significantly contributes"" to it.Only four other Republican senators voted with Ayotte, and no Democrats opposed the resolution, which failed because it did not receive the 60 votes necessary for adoption.The vote puts Ayotte at odds with several Republicans widely expected to be running for president, including Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Flordia.For years Ayotte has been quoted saying that humans likely have an effect on climate change, but rarely has such a vote been cast to declare such a position.""Dating back to her time as attorney general, Senator Ayotte has a long record of standing up for clean air and crossing party lines to protect New Hampshire's environment, and her votes this week are consistent with that record,"" said her spokesman, Liz Johnson.Those include opposing efforts to roll back EPA clean air regulations to prevent cross-state pollution and pollution from mercury and other toxins.The resolution was taken up by the Senate as part of the Keystone Pipeline legislation, which environmentalists oppose and President Obama has said he will veto.Ayotte has already signaled her support of the Keystone Pipeline, and a conservative organization on Thursday said it's not worried about Ayotte's vote on the non-binding resolution.""Our goal is reliable, affordable energy because it's a driver of our economy. Sen. Ayotte has been a consistent supporter of that,"" said Greg Moore, state director of Americans for Prosperity, which is associated with the Koch brothers.""Our focus is on actual policies,"" he said. Moore said Ayotte opposes a gas tax increase, EPA regulations designed to control carbon emissions and previous cap-and-trade proposals. And she supports Keystone.Voting with Ayotte were Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Susan Collins of Maine, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mark Kirk of Illinois.The resolution received 50 votes. It said the warmer temperatures ""reverberate throughout the climate systems of the Earth"" and cause higher sea levels, changes in precipitation, and altered weather patterns.The Senate did vote 98 to 1 in favor of a resolution that said climate change was real.

15,"(Last week, we asked readers this question: “What single, achievable action do you believe would make the biggest difference in the fight against climate change?” Here are the responses we received.)\Stop funding the fossil fuel industry\Here is my answer, and it is not original. You can just follow the money and the answer to the question the Monitor has posed becomes clear. Bill McKibben wrote at length about this very same question in a recent New Yorker magazine article. What we need to do is to stop funding the fossil fuel industry. Lenders, insurers and investors need to stop funding and investing in the fossil fuel industry. People are mad. Some people are afraid. It's time to do something really meaningful that will accomplish a rollback to the speed with which our planet is being degraded by greed.\\CLAUDIA DAMON\Concord\We need a carbon tax\What single, achievable action do I believe would make the biggest difference in the fight against climate change? A carbon tax, applied to everything, no exceptions. It's the only universal and effective way to reduce carbon loading of the atmosphere.\PAUL HAGUE\Weare\Elect leaders who recognize the threat\David Brooks, a.k.a. Granite Geek, I don't want to say you burst my bubble (“Solving the ‘act globally' equation,” Monitor front page, Sept. 17), but frankly, you burst my bubble!\My individual efforts to reduce, reuse and recycle are not just a drop in the bucket of our efforts to avert climate change, they are a mere drop in the ocean of the efforts needed! Here we are in a small city (certainly by global standards) in a small state, but we are sitting right next to a coal-burning power plant that contributes in one hour more CO2 than I do in a quarter century, even before I start zealously reducing my own energy footprint!\Clearly, the solution is much higher up the chain of command. When we have a governor vetoing every single effort to reduce CO2 emissions, from nixing efforts to encourage our fledgling solar industry to vetoing the net metering cap, it's inescapable that we need to act politically. When we have a president who is so beholden to the fossil fuel industry that his idea of progress is to loosen every restriction on auto emissions states like California have struggled heroically to achieve, and to tear down every protection of our air, water and land previous administrations have put in place (which admittedly were only a bucketful in the ocean to begin with), we need to act politically.\So I believe that acting politically to elect leaders who recognize the threat of the climate crisis at least as well as our young people do is the single, most basic step we must take. But I think that is only the first step. In terms of actually slowing climate change we need to cut emissions in our transportation system, our biggest source of CO2. That means not only improving efficiency, but switching to clean energy. Our sun sends us clean power daily. In contrast to the dismal performance of our local power plant, our sun sends in a single hour all the energy the world and all its inhabitants use in a full year. Harnessing solar energy is happening now, but only with political and individual effort will it become more efficient, more affordable and more universal. Solar power needs to light our pathway forward. I'm going to continue to do my part to make that happen, and I encourage you to do yours.\MILLIE LaFONTAINE\Concord\Rethinking rebuilding\I was really happy to see David Brooks's column about our global crisis. His use of simple (not really) math to show that individual, well-meaning, conservation activities won't get the job done proves that it will take agreement and cooperation by all the world's countries to slow down global warming. You'll notice I didn't say stop the warming. Mother Nature has her own agenda and right now it is a warming trend. Nothing we can do about that, just accept it and plan for it.\Now to the question: You asked for a “single, achievable action” in the fight against climate change. The word achievable is the daunting challenge. Some will say my thought means surrendering to the inevitable, and I would say it means simply retreating, but here goes.\We need immediate state and nationwide legislation that prevents anyone from rebuilding, on the same footprint, all homes and businesses, sewage treatment plants, parks, etc., that are destroyed by hurricanes and/or rising sea levels attributed to global warming. Take the insurance money and, perhaps, some modest government assistance and rebuild on higher ground. Drastic? I don't think so.\For example, when New Orleans was devastated by Hurricane Katrina, why were people allowed to rebuild in an area where much of the city was originally built below sea level and protected (?) by levees. This idea won't fly well with those along our shores who want their piece of heaven protected by walls or other barriers (built by others, of course).\The town of Hampton recently took a baby step in the right direction by adopting a regulation that new buildings in certain areas must be built on stilts, in recognition of rising sea levels and future storms.\Sadly, it will be a long time before China and India, two of the world's worst polluters, join the team to seriously address this global issue so we might as well act locally while others talk globally.\GIL ROGERS\Bow\Pricing carbon\The single best action we can take to combat climate change would be to pass a carbon tax, or a cap and trade system. The idea is to start with a fairly high carbon fee and have it steadily increase over time. Stop having endless battles over which coal power plants should close, or what the automobile mileage standards should be, or what types of light bulbs we should use. Let the market know what carbon will cost and then let market forces figure out the details. It is a concept that has support from conservative economists as well as from former Republican treasury secretaries, Federal Reserve chairs, and presidential economic advisers, as well as from multiple Fortune 500 companies. This should be achievable.\Two things stand in the way. The first is Republican control of the U.S. Senate. We in New Hampshire are not in a position to do anything about that because we already have two Democratic senators. All we can do is support Sen. Jean Shaheen next year and hope enough other states replace their Republicans with Democrats.\The other obstacle is President Donald Trump. Just about all of the Democratic candidates support taking action to combat climate change, with many of them supporting either a carbon fee or a cap and trade system. Our special position as New Hampshire primary voters gives us the opportunity and the obligation to try to figure out which candidates will go to the mat for this, and which candidates are saying the words but won't follow through when the going gets tough. And I think the going will get tough on this. It is going to take political courage and leadership to get this done.\When Lyndon Johnson signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act, he told an aide “We have lost the South for a generation.” He knew it was politically dangerous but he pushed it through anyway because it was the only morally defensible thing to do. We need someone with that kind of courage in the climate change fight.\STEPHEN RASCHE\Canterbury\Change your diet\If you're serious about protecting the environment, the most important thing that you can do is to stop eating meat, eggs and dairy.\Feeding massive amounts of grain (that humans could eat) and water (that humans could drink) to farmed animals and then killing them and processing, transporting and storing the products is extremely energy-intensive. And forests – which absorb greenhouse gases – are cut down and often set on fire to supply pastureland and grow crops for farmed animals. Finally, the animals themselves and all the manure that they produce release even more greenhouse gases into our atmosphere.\There have been countless studies proving that going vegan or “plant-based” is the single best way to reverse climate change. The U.N. believes that a global shift toward plant-based food is vital to combat the worst effects of climate change. Globally, animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gases than all the world's transportation systems combined. Combined!\An Oxford University study, published in the journal Climatic Change, shows that meat-eaters are responsible for almost twice as many dietary greenhouse-gas emissions per day as vegetarians and about 2½ times as many as vegans.\I am not saying that we shouldn't take other steps to help the environment, such as reducing our use of plastics and fossil fuel, but the easiest way to make a difference is with our fork. You can start at your next meal, your next night out, your next grocery shopping trip. If you care about the health of the planet, you can make a difference by what you put on your plate.\LAURA SCOTT\Concord\What can we do? Vote\ The big question: “What single, achievable action do you believe would make the biggest difference in the fight against climate change.” The big answer: Vote.\If we do not get the naysayers out of office, we have no hope. It is the one individual thing we can each do that will have a positive, global impact.\The Republican Party, unfortunately, has chosen to be the party of the past, clinging to fossil fuels. President Trump is no surprise. As a candidate he denied the science; as president he has shown repeatedly, by his reversal of environmental protections, that he cares nothing about the planet. Gov. Sununu, a self-proclaimed environmental scientist, was a surprise – to me anyway. When he first became governor of New Hampshire, I had really hoped that he would work to address the carbon problem. Instead, he is following Donald Trump's marching orders. Leaders do not walk around with blinders on. The world needs the equivalent of another Manhattan Project. Will the United States, finally, take the lead to address a global threat? This can only happen if we vote people into office who take this seriously. This is not “diddly-squat.”\We need to look at the records of all local, state and federal candidates running for office. Get the facts; then vote. It is the single most important thing we can do to address this, the biggest question.\How many canaries have to die before we wake up?\JEANNE CUSSON\Concord"
16,"
Manchester Rep. Amanda Bouldin never expected the first two bills she filed in her legislative career would become a centerpiece of the state's response to the opioid crisis.
\
But by now you have probably heard of both, either on television, over the radio or from a top public official.
\
Her bills to expand access to overdose reversal drugs and offer criminal immunity to some people who report overdoses are now advertised in a major public awareness campaign the state launched to tackle addiction.
\
Bouldin's legislation is often cited by Gov. Maggie Hassan and top Republican lawmakers as key pieces of the state strategy to tackle the rising number of drug overdoses, which claimed more than 320 lives in New Hampshire last year.
\
But the bills didn't start out as a major policy push by leaders in Concord. In fact, the bills began with a conversation between two friends on a couch, Bouldin said.
\
After hearing a story on New Hampshire Public Radio, Bouldin's friend suggested she file a bill making the overdose-reversal drug Narcan accessible to addicts and their families.
\
""I looked it up online, and thought 'why is this hard to get, it shouldn't be so hard to get,' "" said Bouldin, a 30-year-old Democrat elected in 2014 to her first term in the House.
\
A few of Bouldin's other friends urged her to put in a bill that had failed in the past, giving people who report overdoses immunity from criminal prosecution in specific cases.
\
""The bills seemed like commonsense policy change,"" said Bouldin, who admittedly didn't know much about the opiate situation in New Hampshire when she filed the legislation. But once she started doing research, using downtime at her job in sales to find news articles and read studies, Bouldin was shocked to learn about the state's climbing overdose rates.
\
""I'm kind of disappointed this is all that New Hampshire is really offering people right now,"" she said, reflecting on the legislation in an interview Thursday. ""I put a lot of energy into it; I am nobody.""
\
Since Bouldin filed the bills almost a year ago, a lot has changed in New Hampshire.
\
Public awareness of substance abuse and opioid addiction is on the rise. One in four New Hampshire voters say drug abuse is the most important problem facing the state, besting jobs and the economy as a top issue for the first time in almost a decade, according to a recent Granite State Poll.
\
Politicians are taking note.
\
Across the spectrum, from local representatives and city councilors to U.S. Senators and presidential hopefuls, lawmakers are vying for a piece of the pie by proposing legislation and holding endless roundtables meant to show the public they are listening or planning to take action.
\
At the State House, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agree that improving New Hampshire's policies around drug abuse is a key priority for the coming legislative session.
\
Last week, during dueling events, top state Republicans and Hassan laid out separate substance abuse agendas with many similarities, suggesting both parties can find common ground on the issue in coming weeks. They could start by holding a unified press conference next time.
\
As the 2016 election draws near, it's not clear whether the importance of getting something done will foster bipartisanship in Concord, or the political posturing to claim credit will get in the way of results.
\
For Bouldin, getting the bills through the Legislature took a lot of work and support from other lawmakers and family advocates. Despite a growing focus on substance abuse, it wasn't always an easy ride, she said.
\
When Bouldin first asked people to testify in favor of the bills, she heard crickets. So, she turned to an old Concord Monitor article on the state's rising heroin problem and began dialing those quoted in the story. She found Donna Marston, a Concord resident who founded the support group Families Sharing Without Shame, who proved a game changer.
\
""That cracked open this whole grassroots world I didn't know about in New Hampshire of parents running outreach groups, talking to other parents,"" she said. ""I really was surprised at how much depth there is to the recovery community in New Hampshire.""
\
It was a community that came out in full force to Concord to tell lawmakers deeply personal stories of loss, and of recovery. It ultimately helped the bills get through, Bouldin and others said. ""There were a lot of people that came together,"" Marston said.
\
The change lawmakers made to the Narcan bill - which had 12 House and Senate cosponsors - was to speed up the implementation date. The immunity bill underwent a much more thorough review process, but it ultimately cleared the House and Senate before Hassan signed it.
\
Bouldin is excited both bills are making a difference.
\
""Anyone who wants to take credit deserves it, all the people involved in the process of passing a bill had an opportunity to kill it,"" she said. ""If they want to make a big deal about it, they should.""
\
Environment, heating up
\
On the environment, Kelly Ayotte is winning praise from conservation organizations. But she is also drawing criticism from two groups on opposite sides of the political spectrum - the state Democratic party and Americans for Prosperity.
\
Ayotte, who is facing a competitive re-election bid against Hassan, recently became the first Republican senator to back the Environmental Protection Agency's plan to reduce carbon emissions from power plants.
\
Groups like the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters applauded her decision, announced last Sunday.
\
But Ayotte's stance came under fire for similar reasons from both state democrats and Americans for Prosperity, a conservative nonprofit backed by the Koch Brothers. The groups argue Ayotte's position on the EPA plan doesn't square with the past.
\
Democrats said Ayotte is trying to rewrite her record. AFP put out a release calling Ayotte's support for the plan ""particularly disappointing given her past efforts to oppose excessive environmental regulations that have no impact on global temperatures.""
\
It puts Ayotte in a tricky situation, as she tries to tout a record on the environment that her staff calls strong, independent and includes ""repeatedly crossing party lines to vote in support of clean air and water.""
\
It's not clear what role the environment will play in the upcoming election, but it is clear Democrats are trying to push it into the spotlight. Ayotte's stance may not appeal to national Republicans, but local GOPers are coming to her defense. Former New Hampshire senator Judd Gregg said support for the EPA shows a ""steadfast commitment to advancing New Hampshire's tradition of responsible environmental stewardship.""
\
It looks like this fight isn't over.
\
Sign up New Hampshire
\
Ayotte wasn't the only one backing environmental plans last week. Hassan said New Hampshire will sign on to the Under 2 MOU, a commitment among states and regions to reduce harmful emissions - in this case to lower green house gas emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050.
\
The convenient thing for both Ayotte and Hassan is that New Hampshire doesn't have to change much to meet the goals, both the EPA Clean Power Plan and the Under 2 MOU, according to officials.
\
New Hampshire plans to meet the EPA rule through its current participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program. And the goals in the Under 2 MOU are in line with current emissions goals New Hampshire is set to meet or exceed through RGGI, the renewable portfolio standard and other efforts, according to Hassan's spokesman, William Hinkle.
\
Which is it?
\
How many opioids are doctors prescribing? Sen. Andy Sanborn may want to check his numbers.
\
""In a three-month period 68 million doses of opioids were prescribed in our state in three months,"" the Bedford Republican told a crowd of reporters at a press conference last week. ""That's 270 million individual pills in a state with only 1.3 million people in it.""
\
Ten minutes later, he said: ""Three hundred million drugs have been prescribed in a year in this state.""
\
The figures have come up in news stories recently as state officials, pointing to a link between prescription drug abuse and heroin addiction, have been trying to crack down on opioid prescribing practices.
\
The New Hampshire Prescription Drug Monitoring Program went into effect last October, and so far state officials have tracked more than 102 million individual doses of drugs prescribed to patients.
\
More than half of the doses prescribed from October 2014 to June were for prescription pain medication: 52.9 million were pain relievers and 37.7 million were Schedule II drugs, the ones with the highest potential for abuse such as oxycodone, fentanyl and amphetamine.
\
Political theater
\
Stop by the secretary of state's office this month if you are looking for a spectacle. Presidential candidates can begin filing to participate in the New Hampshire primary starting Nov. 4, and most come in person.
\
The filing deadline lasts until Nov. 20. In 2012, 44 candidates representing 26 different states filed to run in the New Hampshire primary, according to the secretary of state.

17,"Recent headline-grabbing events have shown just how dirty and dangerous fossil fuels are. The mine collapse in West Virginia and the catastrophic oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico have demonstrated that extracting coal and oil from the earth will always be hazardous to human life and health. Meanwhile, the disastrous floods in Nashville have given us a sobering look into the future, as storms and other extreme weather patterns driven by climate change increase in intensity and in the damage they cause.\The solution to these problems is simple: clean, renewable energy. Harvesting energy from the sun, wind, waves and plant materials doesn't kill workers or destroy whole areas of the country. We can power our homes and businesses with forms of energy that create good, permanent jobs here in New Hampshire and across the United States. And contrary to the fearmongering put forth by Big Oil, clean energy development creates jobs and saves American consumers money.\Comprehensive climate and energy legislation would save every New Hampshire household $1,550 a year by 2030, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. The Lempster Wind Power Project in Sullivan County created 120 jobs and powers 10,000 homes with homegrown energy whose fuel is entirely clean and costs nothing.\Dollar for dollar, investment in clean energy creates three times as many jobs as investment in fossil fuel energy. And the long-term trends are clear: fossil fuel costs are rising (especially as we come to understand the tremendous costs associated with disasters like the BP spill) and renewable energy costs are falling, as technologies scale up and efficiency improves.\Cap-and-trade legislation would accelerate those trends, providing a win-win-win for the environment, the economy and consumers.\Here in New Hampshire, we already have a mandatory cap-and-trade system limiting our state's emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. New Hampshire is part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, implemented between 2005 and 2007 by Eastern states. RGGI will reduce the region's emissions by 10 percent by 2018. And contrary to the predictions of the doomsayers, New England, and New Hampshire in particular, is still doing slightly better than the country as a whole in terms of unemployment and economic performance. Capping carbon emissions is not only the right thing to do, it puts Americans back to work right now and will save money in the long run.\The bill being introduced in Congress to deal with climate and energy is far from perfect. It gives too much away to the fossil fuel industries, and it is to be hoped that in light of the Gulf disaster, the provisions for new offshore drilling will be stripped from the bill before it is finalized. But it does provide for significant long-term emissions cuts, and thus it is a start. And if images like those from Nashville, of flooded homes, ruined belongings and lost lives, are not to become commonplace on the nightly news, we desperately need to make that start.\As a pastor and a person of faith, I believe that fighting climate change is part of our responsibility to care for God's creation. (I write this piece as a private individual, not a representative of the Episcopal Church, although my church is on record as supporting efforts to reduce carbon emissions.)\However, it is increasingly clear that although the moral obligation to be stewards of the earth is a powerful one, fighting climate change is also a matter of pragmatic self-interest. Cleaning up our act with regard to energy will also put badly needed money in consumers' pockets over the long term and create good-paying jobs that cannot be outsourced. It will vastly improve the quality of life of our children and grandchildren.\Clean, unlimited energy from the sun, wind, waves and other renewable sources is the energy of the future; fossil energy is the dirty energy of the past. We only need to look at recent headlines to see the hazards of staying stuck in the past: mine collapses, oil leaks, floods, destroyed ecosystems, wrecked livelihoods, lost lives. The Senate and President Obama must act immediately to begin the transition to the energy system of the future.\.\The Rev. Grace Burson is rector of Grace Episcopal Church in Manchester."

Republican leaders in the House and Senate have struck a deal on what to do with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and it doesn't involve withdrawing New Hampshire from the program.
\
Last year, House leaders walked away from negotiations with the Senate after refusing to accept anything but a complete withdrawal from the carbon cap-and-trade program. The Senate doesn't have the 16 votes needed from its 24 members to override a promised veto of repeal by Democratic Gov. John Lynch.
\
Rep. Jim Garrity of Atkinson, the leader of the House negotiating team, acknowledged yesterday he wasn't going to get everything he wanted by accepting the Senate's bill to reform the program and reduce its impact in the state.
\
""As you know by history, the House prefers a definite repeal date, but we can count to 16,"" Garrity said. ""We can live with the Senate version because it does help ratepayers.""
\
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is a multi-state compact designed to cut participants' carbon emissions 10 percent by 2018. Republicans argue the RGGI program acts as a built-in tax on power producers that is passed down to consumers. A state report found RGGI adds 46 cents to the average homeowner's monthly electric bill.
\
The Senate version of the bill takes state revenue from auctioning off carbon allowances to power plants - money currently distributed by the state Public Utilities Commission as grants for energy efficiency projects - and puts it into an energy efficiency fund controlled by utility companies. The bill also lowers the rebate threshold on auction proceeds so money that would have been spent by companies to purchase carbon allowances is used to slightly reduce rates for customers.
\
Though the Senate version does not have the outright repeal provision desired by the House, it does provide a mechanism for New Hampshire to leave the program if it is preceded by the withdrawal of two other New England states, or one state carrying 10 percent of the energy load between the New England states participating in the program.
\
Senate Majority Leader Jeb Bradley, the Wolfeboro Republican who led the Senate's negotiating effort, had raised concerns in the past that the Public Utilities Commission was handing out politically motivated energy efficiency grants to companies and institutions that didn't need them.
\
""We're going to continue to do energy efficiency through RGGI, but we're going to really benefit programs that get the best bang for their dollar,"" Bradley said of putting the money into the utility-run fund.
\
Advocates of the program weren't cheering the RGGI deal. Cathy Corkery, chapter director of the New Hampshire Sierra Club, said ""this medal, this badge, that Garrity is trying wear that he's reducing rates is a joke.""
\
""The way that they have manipulated this program and this amendment will make the program less effective, less innovative and it will apply to a smaller pool of people,"" Corkery said.
\
Jessica O'Hare, spokeswoman for Environment New Hampshire, said the compromise bill cuts funding for energy efficiency projects in half.
\
""We are very disappointed that powerful out-of-state fossil fuel interest convinced our many of our legislators to significantly weaken a program that is working,"" O'Hare said.
\
Lynch had vetoed last year's effort to withdraw New Hampshire from RGGI and has maintained his opposition to such efforts. But it's unclear what he'll do with the bill agreed to yesterday.
\
""The governor believes it is important that New Hampshire remains in the RGGI program and this bill does that,"" Colin Manning, Lynch's spokesman, said yesterday. ""It also makes a number of changes, and the Governor is going to review those changes.""
\
Corey Lewandowski, state director of Americans for Prosperity, a national conservative group opposed to RGGI, expressed disappointment that the compromise bill does not include a repeal date.
\
""At the end of the day, we're still stuck in a failed cap-and-trade program,"" Lewandowski said. ""The people of New Hampshire should not be beholden to any other state or and other Legislature to do what's best for them.""
\
Lewandowski said now the question is whether the full House will be able to pass a bill that reforms the program instead of repealing it.
\
""I just don't know that they can get that through the House, and if they don't we'll be sitting back here in the same place we were last time,"" he said.
\
Garrity said the compromise bill has the blessing of House leaders.
\
""They basically told me: 'Do what you need to do,' "" he said.

'I'm investigating things that begin with M,"" the Mad Hatter told the guests at his famous tea party. So, too, 140 years after the publication of Alice in Wonderland, are the Legislature, Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, the Department of Environmental Services, concerned residents in Hopkinton and countless other folks. They are investigating mercury.
\
Specifically, all sides want to know what effect the toxic element has on the environment and human health and how to reduce mercury emissions from the power plants that are the largest manmade source of the metal.
\
Airborne emissions of mercury, like lead, chromium, arsenic and many other toxins, have never been regulated federally. A new EPA proposal calls for reducing mercury emissions - but not those from other toxic metals - from coal-fired power plants by 50 percent by 2018. States, however, can set even tougher mercury standards, and last week the New Hampshire Senate voted to do so.
\
In a key decision, the Senate banned Public Service from participating in the EPA's proposed cap-and-trade program for mercury. That would permit cleaner utilities to sell credits to pollute to dirtier ones. But no cap-and-trade program should be approved that allows one company to sell rights that allow another to poison nearby residents. That morally bankrupt Bush administration proposal is now the subject of a lawsuit by the attorneys general of nine states, including New Hampshire.
\
The Bow and Newington plants send 129 pounds of mercury into the air annually, nine from the Shiller plant and 120 from Merrimack station, which uses a different boiler system. The Senate bill calls for reducing mercury emissions from the combined plants to 50 pounds by mid-2009 and 24 pounds by 2013.
\
Public Service says those deadlines could make it uneconomical to operate Bow's Merrimack Station. We doubt that, but it does appear that no abatement technology exists that is reliable enough for a vendor to guarantee that it can meet the Senate's goals if the company invests in its equipment. Public Service has invested in pollution-control technology in the past that quickly became outdated and doesn't want that to happen again.
\
The state Public Utilities Commission believes mercury emissions from the Bow plant could be reduced by 65 percent if the utility invested $76 million, or $1 per month per customer, for the next 15 years. That's fine for 2009, but it would fall far short of the 2013 target. So the utility has a point. Public Service wants to work with the state to meet the 2013 goal but does not believe a huge investment in an unproven technology makes sense. Environmental groups think the utility is stalling.
\
Since mercury has rendered fish caught in most New Hampshire waters inedible in any quantity, it's hard to argue in favor of delay. But a clear fix has not been identified. So here are a few questions we'd like to see answered before the House and Gov. John Lynch ink any deal.
\
How likely is it that the tough goals would cause the Bow plant to close? What is the best available technology for reducing emissions from a plant like Merrimack Station? How likely is it that current technology can allow the utility to meet the Senate's goals?
\
And when considering how much utility customers should spend to reduce emissions, what is the cost of each year's delay in ill health and environmental damage? Mercury poisoning, for example, has been linked to an alarming increase in autism, which increased 500 percent over the past decade, according to the General Accounting Office.
\
The expression ""mad as a hatter""came to be because hatters used mercury to cure fur to make felt hats. So The Mad Hatter wasn't crazy to start investigating things that began with ""M""- he was just too late. Let's hope the same doesn't prove true for those living near power plants.

Monitor editorial

20,"
With just two weeks to go before the primary election, Republican Senate candidates Bill Binnie and Kelly Ayotte felt the heat at last night's Monadnock Debate at Franklin Pierce University in Rindge.
\
When Ayotte, the former attorney general, quizzed Binnie, a businessman, on whether he had shipped jobs overseas, Binnie said he expanded with manufacturing facilities all over the world - but did not close a factory and move jobs to Mexico.
\
""Shame on you,"" Binnie said, calling Ayotte's accusation a ""complete attempt to malign my business experience.""
\
Ayotte responded, ""After you spent $1 million to run five negative ads against me, shame on you.""
\
Businessman Jim Bender then hit Ayotte for raising money from special interest groups.
\
""What do these people think they're buying with $10,000 contributions, and what will these contributions cost the rest of us?"" Bender said.
\
Ayotte responded that donors will get a ""tough, conservative leader for New Hampshire.""
\
Bender then turned on Binnie. ""The word around town in Portsmouth, Rye and New Castle is many people are fearful of you, view you as arbitrary, capricious, and the only person who made money in a Binnie company is Bill Binnie,"" Bender said.
\
Binnie responded that he has numerous long-term employees and was proud of his business success, having competed in worldwide markets and done billions of dollars worth of transactions.
\
""I've made people wealthy,"" Binnie said. ""Name-calling belittles the process.""
\
Only attorney Ovide Lamontagne largely stayed out of the fray.
\
Many of the issues raised at the debate related to the environment. The candidates agreed that they opposed a cap-and-trade tax, along with most government mandates relating to energy.
\
Bender said he did not believe global warming was affecting New Hampshire and said it was not one of his top 20 priorities as U.S. senator.
\
""We have flawed science,"" Bender said. ""There's no scientific evidence man is causing global warming.""
\
Dennis Lamare of Lee was equally dubious.
\
""I believe in climate change. Spring, summer, winter, fall,"" Lamare said.
\
Ayotte said cap-and-trade would make the U.S. less competitive.
\
""China and India won't impose similar restrictions on themselves,"" Ayotte said.
\
The candidates did say the U.S. must reduce its dependence on foreign oil, largely for economic and national security reasons. Both Lamontagne and Binnie said they would support drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Lamontagne said drilling in ANWR carried less environmental risk than the deep sea drilling that led to the BP oil spill.
\
""It's a rich resource without going deep to the ocean floor,"" Lamontagne said.
\
Binnie said he is sensitive to the need to protect natural resources, but he supports exploration for natural gas and oil. He said the U.S. must rely on technology and free market solutions to solve its energy problems.
\
""I would explore for energy all over the country in all reasonable places,"" Binnie said.
\
Several candidates also said they would support the expanded use of nuclear power. Ayotte said nuclear technology has improved since 20 years ago.
\
""We continue to purchase oil from people who hate us,"" Ayotte said. ""We need to develop more nuclear power. . . . Other countries laugh to think we're not using our own resources, but buying from them.""
\
On economic issues, all of the candidates agreed they would repeal any remaining money from the federal stimulus package. All stressed the need to create jobs in the private sector, through tax cuts and incentives for businesses. They agreed the U.S. must cut spending and borrow less money.
\
""Stimulus money pays for union jobs - teachers, police, firefighters. It doesn't do anything for the private sector,"" Lamare said.
\
Binnie said he worries about China gaining a competitive advantage over the U.S. and the U.S. losing jobs to China.
\
""It's a myth people move jobs overseas for labor costs,"" Binnie said. ""They move for tax purposes.""
\
One moment of dissent for Lamontagne came when the candidates were asked about the war in Iraq. Lamontagne, alone among the candidates, said he believed going into Iraq was a mistake.
\
""We went on a false premise"" that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, he said.
\
Each candidate said he or she was the one who could change voters' perceptions of Congress. Binnie said voters needed fewer lawyers in Washington and more businessmen. Ayotte said she would work to end earmarks and support term limits. Bender talked about restoring trust to government. Lamontagne said voters were disappointed that President Obama brought ""European-style socialism"" to the U.S. through his health care reform and bank bailouts.
\
State Democratic Party spokeswoman Emily Browne said after the debate, ""Bill Binnie and Kelly Ayotte seemed more interested in saying, 'I told you so,' and politically one-upping each other than in having an honest debate. Tonight we saw the GOP candidates do the same thing they've been doing this whole campaign - race each other to the extreme right to try and score political points in a crowded primary.""

21,"
The House voted yesterday to continue a legislative committee overseeing the privatization of the state's prisons and to give it what critics say is inappropriate access to sealed bids from companies who want the job.
\
The bill ""creates the beginning of a slippery slope,"" said Rep. Robert Foose, a New London Democrat. ""The committee is intruding itself on the work of the executive branch (by) gaining access in ways that are not done in any other purchasing processes"" in the state.
\
Foose persuaded some but not most. The House voted 220-101 to give the committee greater access to bid information after being told by another lawmaker it was the only way to keep prison officials honest as the bids are evaluated.
\
The bill must go back to the Senate for a vote because the Senate's version did not grant the bid access; it only extended the committee's report deadline.
\
The House has until today to act on bills sent over from the Senate. Representatives made a decent dent in its work yesterday.
\
In addition to the privatization bill, it voted on bills dealing with medical malpractice lawsuits, lifting a tax on internet access and scaling back a regional cap-and-trade program.
\
The Legislature created a privatization committee of three House members and two senators last year to develop a plan for privatizing the state's prisons. Simultaneously, and under the orders from the Legislature and Gov. John Lynch, state officials requested bids for three prison projects: a men's prison, a women's prison and a hybrid of the two.
\
Those bids arrived recently but too late for the legislative committee to hear from state officials about the merits of the bids. Hence, the need to amend the committee's deadline.
\
The House Finance Committee added the language giving the committee its own access to those bids. Rep. William Belvin, an Amherst Republican, argued for it on the House floor yesterday.
\
""The Department of Corrections spends over $200 million of general fund money and is in need of reform,"" Belvin said. ""If I know the (department) is less than enthusiastic about privatization, and if I know this amendment gives the Legislature the ability to form an independent judgment of evaluating privatization proposals, I would vote for this.""
\
The House did.
\
'Early offer' settlements
\
A pioneering ""early offer"" system for medical malpractice cases sailed through the House yesterday, touted as a way to reduce money and time spent in court.
\
Senate Bill 406 allows medical providers to offer compensation to victims of malpractice to avoid litigation, a proposal backed by hospitals and opposed by trial attorneys. Opponents say it could tip the scales against patients who request an early offer but decide it isn't enough, as the patient would then have to pay the medical provider's legal fees if they lose their case in court or the settlement ends up to be about what they would have initially received.
\
The bill, written in conjunction with a University of Virginia law school professor, passed with a veto-proof majority, just as a slightly different version did in the Senate. Colin Manning, spokesman for Lynch, said the governor ""has concerns about the bill.""
\
House Majority Leader D.J. Bettencourt, a Salem Republican, called the bill a ""win-win for all involved."" House Speaker Bill O'Brien, a Mont Vernon Republican, said in a statement the bill ""allows malpractice victims a route to find resolution quickly, if they so choose, and be able to move on with their lives.""
\
""By establishing an optional process for victims of medical injury to pursue their claim without having to go through lengthy and expensive litigation, we can reduce the uncertainty for both patients and providers, which in turn will lower health care costs for consumers,"" O'Brien said.
\
Internet access tax
\
It turns out the House is on board with banning a tax on internet access after all.
\
Last week, with relations strained between the House and Senate, the House responded to the Senate tabling several of its bills by killing the Senate's repeal of the internet access tax. But a House committee later attached the internet tax ban onto a Senate bill on dredging permit fees.
\
Yesterday, the House voted 245-80 to pass the dredging bill, with the tax ban included.
\
""Eliminating the tax on the internet will put money into the pockets of New Hampshire's working families,"" Bettencourt said in a statement. ""At a time when we are still facing a difficult recovery in our economy, this is a step that will provide relief and encourage more individuals to get connected online and have access to all the advantages of the information on the web.""
\
Opponents of the tax ban said the state could not afford the loss of revenue, estimated at $6 million annually.
\
RGGI
\
Whether Republicans in the House and Senate can finally agree on what to do with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is still an open question.
\
The House voted yesterday not to concur with a Senate bill weakening the carbon cap-and-trade program's impact in New Hampshire and instead sent the bill to a committee of conference where leaders from both chambers will try to come to a compromise. Last year, a committee of conference on the RGGI issue ended abruptly when House negotiators said they wouldn't accept anything less than the state's complete withdrawal from the program, which doesn't have enough support in the Senate to override the governor's promised veto.
\
This time, the House leaders say they're willing to listen to what the Senate brings to the table. Supporters of RGGI say the program is working by creating revenue for energy efficiency projects in the state as it strives to reduce power plants' carbon emissions by 10 percent by 2018.
\
Republicans say it acts as a tax on power producers passed down to consumers.
\
Environment New Hampshire, a group committed to keeping RGGI in New Hampshire, cautiously applauded the House vote yesterday as a sign a deal might not get done.
\
""We shouldn't be rolling back a program that is working to lower our energy bills, keep energy dollars in our state, and reduce pollution,"" said Jessica O'Hare, a group spokeswoman.
\
Medical marijuana
\
The House ignored a veto promise and passed a bill to legalize home cultivation of marijuana for medical purposes.
\
The vote sends the bill back to the Senate to review changes. The Senate-passed bill would allow patients with debilitating medical conditions or the patient's designated caretaker to cultivate and possess up to 6 ounces of marijuana, four mature plants and 12 seedlings at a registered location.
\
Lynch has promised to veto the bill if it reaches his desk. He is concerned about a lack of control over distribution.

Re ""Impact of climate plan on plant uncertain"" (Sunday Monitor Local & State page, July 14):
\
Those who do not prioritize climate change want to keep these dirty power plants in business. When groups like this go unchecked, they can pollute and destroy the environment without any constraint. The way to put an end to this rampant destruction is through capping emission levels and investing in clean, renewable energy sources.
\
A few states, including New Hampshire, are already doing the right thing by signing onto the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the cap-and-trade program that limits carbon emissions by power plants and funds clean energy programs all while making the economy grow. Fossil-fuel companies and power plants cannot control our economies, politics and environments any longer, especially in the wake of so many climate-related disasters.
\
We need to maintain and strengthen RGGI alongside President Obama's plans to keep New Hampshire on track for a clean energy future.

This report shows how Rep. Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, voted on 50 of the most newsworthy issues considered by the House from Jan. 27, 2009, through Aug. 2, 2012. Mitt Romney, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, has selected Ryan as his vice-presidential running mate.
\
2012
\
1. Payroll-Tax Cut: The House on Feb. 17, 2012, voted, 293-132, to extend until Dec. 31 a law allowing workers to contribute 4.2 percent of their pay to Social Security, down from the standard 6.2 percent. The $100 billion cost of financing the tax cut was to be deficit spending, and the bill's remaining $50 billion in outlays were to be offset by revenue measures. A yes vote was to send the Senate a bill that also funded long-term jobless benefits and protected from Medicare cuts. (HR 3630)
\
Ryan voted no.
\
2. Medicare Cost Panel: The House on March 22, 2012, voted, 223-181, to abolish the Independent Payment Advisory Panel created by the 2010 health law to curb Medicare costs with Congress having a say in its decisions.

\
Ryan voted yes.
\
3. The Paul Ryan Budget: The House on March 29, 2012, passed, 228-191, a Republican budget for fiscal 2013 and later years that would eventually privatize Medicare, make Bush-era tax cuts permanent, cut personal and business taxes, simplify the tax code, slash deficits and cut domestic spending. The measure was named informally after Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee. A yes vote was to pass HCR 112.
\
Ryan voted yes.
\
4. Voter ID Laws: The House on May 9, 2012, voted, 232-190, to prevent the Justice Department from interfering with state voter ID laws.

\
5. Violence Against Women: The House on May 16, 2012, voted, 222-205, to renew the Violence Against Women Act for five years at funding of $680 million annually. Democrats disputed this Republican bill mainly because it omitted provisions in a bi-partisan Senate-passed bill to expand protections for battered women who are illegal immigrants, Native American women who are assaulted on reservations by non-Indians and gays, lesbians and transsexuals. A yes vote backed the GOP bill (HR 4970).
\
Ryan voted yes.

\
Ryan voted no.
\
9. Defense-Spending Freeze: The House on July 19, 2012, voted, 247-167, to freeze the core defense budget for fiscal 2013 at the 2012 level of $518 billion while protecting military healthcare and pay levels and $87.7 billion in war outlays from cuts.

\
Ryan voted no.
\
2011
\
1. Climate-Change Science: Voting 184-240, members on April 6, 2011, refused to embrace the Environmental Protection Agency's ""scientific findings...that climate change is occurring, is caused largely by human activities, and poses significant risks for public health and welfare.""

\
Ryan voted no.
\
2. Greenhouse Gases: The House on April 7, 2011, passed, 255-172, a bill denying the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) power to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions linked to climate change and challenging the science upon which those regulations are based. A yes vote was to pass HR 910.

\
Ryan voted yes.
\
5.

\

This vote repudiated the argument of Defense Secretary Robert Gates that the spending is wasteful. A yes vote was to delete the $485 million.
\
Ryan did not vote.
\
6. DISCLOSE Act: The House on June 24, 2010, passed, 219-206, the DISCLOSE Act, which requires companies, unions and interest groups to fully identify themselves when they fund campaign ads. For TV ads, the disclosures were to be on screen. A yes vote was to pass HR 5175.
\
Ryan voted no.
\
7.

\
Ryan voted no.
\
8. War, Teacher Funding: The House on July 1, 2010, sent the Senate, 239-182, a deficit-neutral $80 billion appropriations bill that included spending such as $33.5 billion for war and $10 billion to avert teacher layoffs. A yes vote was to pass HR 4899 over GOP arguments it should contain only war funding.
\
Ryan voted no.
\
9. Afghanistan Withdrawal: The House on July 1, 2010, defeated, 100-321, a bid to require military funding in a pending appropriations bill (HR 4899) to be spent on orderly U.S. troop withdrawals from Afghanistan instead of paying for President Obama's 30,000-troop surge there. A yes vote was to fund a pullout from Afghanistan.
\
Ryan voted no.

10. Jobless Checks: The House on July 22, 2010, voted, 272-152, to extend benefits for the long-term jobless until Nov. 30, 2010, at a cost of $34 billion in deficit spending. A yes vote was to send HR 4213 to President Obama with arguments that Congress has always used deficit spending to fund extended unemployment benefits.
\
Ryan voted no.
\
11. Offshore Drilling The House on July 30, 2010, voted, 209-193, to set new safety and environmental rules for offshore drilling, lift the $75 million cap on a firm's liability following spills, and give whistleblower protections to workers who report violations on rigs. A yes vote was to send HR 3534 to the Senate.
\
Ryan voted no.
\
12. Small-Business Lending: The House on Sept. 23, 2010, authorized, 237-187, Treasury lending to community banks designed to leverage $300 billion in loans to small businesses. The deficit-neutral bill also provided $12 billion in business tax breaks. A yes vote was to send the bill (HR 5297) to President Obama.

2009
\
1. Lilly Ledbetter Act: Voting 250-177, the House on Jan 27, 2009, sent President Obama a bill giving plaintiffs more standing to sue for pay-bias under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The bill became the first major law that he signed.

\
Ryan voted no.
\
2. $787 Billion Stimulus: Voting 246-183, the House on Feb. 13, 2009, gave its final approval to a $787 billion stimulus package that would use a mix of two-thirds direct spending and one-third tax cuts to create or save at least 3.5 million jobs by 2011.

\
Ryan voted no.
\
4. Tobacco Regulation: By a vote of 307-97, the House on June 12, 2009, gave final congressional approval to a bill that began Food and Drug Administration regulation of tobacco products, with the cost paid by fees on tobacco manufacturers and importers.

\
Ryan voted no.
\
9. Republican Health Plan: The House on Nov. 7, 2009, defeated, 176-258, a GOP alternative to HR 3962 (below) that used tens of billions of dollars in payments to states over ten years as an incentive for them to expand health insurance and lower medical costs for their resident.

\
Ryan voted yes.
\
10. Obama Health Plan: The House on Nov. 7, 2009, passed, 220-215, a health plan by President Obama that would provide medical insurance for 36 million uncovered, legal U.S. residents while overhauling insurance-industry practices in ways designed to benefit the sick, the well, the uninsured and the insured.

25,"Monitor staff \Republican Gov. Chris Sununu says New Hampshire won't join a growing number of states that are pledging to uphold the Paris climate agreement following President Donald Trump's decision to back out.\“Not at this time, especially when we do not yet know its impact on our economy and environment,” Sununu said in a statement.\The decision quickly drew criticism from members of the state's Democratic Congressional delegation, who urged Sununu to reconsider.\“The Paris Climate Agreement sets laudable benchmarks for reducing greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming,” said the state's senior Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. “New Hampshire should be spearheading efforts to curb the dangerous effects of climate change.”\Ten more members, including four states in New England, this week joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, which aims to cut emissions by at least 26 percent from 2005 levels and meet targets set in the federal Clean Power Plan.\While the initiative was launched last week by Democratic governors in California, New York and Washington, Republican leaders in Vermont and Massachusetts have also signed on. Democratic governors in Connecticut and Rhode Island have made their states part of the coalition, too.\“Our administration looks forward to continued, bipartisan collaboration with other states to protect the environment, grow the economy and deliver a brighter future to the next generation,” Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said in a statement.\In an interview with New Hampshire Public Radio last week, Sununu said he hadn't really thought about Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the international climate pact.\“You know, it's not my job to go through the whole accord and look at the in-depth impacts across the country, economically,” he told NHPR. “The president has done that, his team has done that, and they've made the decision they feel is in the best interest of the United States and I stand by that.”\In a statement to the Monitor on Monday, Sununu said he has made cleaning up groundwater a top priority and remains committed to New Hampshire's “long and proud tradition of responsible environmental stewardship.”\New Hampshire already takes steps to reduce harmful emissions by participating in a regional cap-and-trade pact made up of nine states along the East Coast. Under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, fossil fuel-burning power plants have to buy allowances for every ton of carbon dioxide they emit. New Hampshire earned $15 million in auction proceeds last year, according to the Department of Environmental Services.\Sununu has voiced support in the past for leaving the RGGI, but has said more recently that it may be feasible only if other states also withdraw.\(Allie Morris can be reached at 369-3307 or amorris@cmonitor.com.)"

Jeb Bradley, a Republican congressional candidate in the 1st District, said he never questioned whether he would run again for the seat that he lost in 2006 to Democrat Carol Shea-Porter.
\
""I never had a thought about waiting,"" said Bradley, who served two terms. ""If I was going to do it, I wanted to go right back to it.""
\
Some things haven't changed much in the past two years. Bradley, who is from Wolfeboro and faces his toughest competition from former Health and Human Services commissioner John Stephen of Manchester, still bills himself as someone who can bring ""common sense"" to the nation's big issues. He still passes out business cards with his cell phone number on them, promising to answer when his constituents call.
\
Many other things have changed, Bradley said repeatedly during a recent interview with the Monitor's editorial board.
\
The war in Iraq was the central issue in the 2006 race. Today, the economy is front and center.
\
Conditions in Iraq have improved, Bradley said. When Secretary of Defense Robert Gates replaced Donald Rumsfeld and sent a surge of troops into Iraq he ""made a statement that we were going to win,"" he said.
\
""The situation is clearly much better today than it was two years ago, and I think that we need to continue to give the Iraqi people the breathing room to fulfill the political reconciliation process with oil legislation that's vitally important and the elections that are going to happen this fall,"" he said.
\
He said the United States needs to turn more attention to Afghanistan and work to persuade NATO to send more troops there.
\
Average families are much worse off than they were in 2006, he said. He is focusing his campaign on three issues to address that: energy, health care and taxes.
\
Once staunchly against drilling for oil in the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge, Bradley now says he supports it, along with mining for oil shale in the Rocky Mountains, offshore drilling, ""clean coal"" technology, expanding nuclear power, building more refineries and investing in renewable energy.
\
Asked why he changed his position on the wildlife refuge, Bradley said the increase in fuel prices is affecting families.
\
""I don't think that we can ignore the fact that there's a significant amount of oil that can be extracted without damaging the environment, if it's done correctly, and it absolutely should be. . . . We can protect the environment given the technology we enjoy today.""
\
Bradley said he is wary of potential effects that creating a national cap-and-trade program to control emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from power plants could have on the economy.
\
On taxes, Bradley said he wants to extend the cuts created under the Bush administration for the wealthiest taxpayers. He said uncertainty over whether those cuts will be reversed is affecting people's investment decisions.
\
""It's small businesses that generally create most of the new jobs coming out of an economic downturn,"" he said. ""Raising the tax rates on some of the most productive members of our society I'm not sure is going to produce the results that I think everybody wants.""
\
Bradley also said he wants to see health care reform in three areas: making it more difficult to sue doctors, giving small business owners ""Wal-Mart-like discounts"" by allowing them to join with others across state lines to pool their buying power and making it easier for individuals to carry their plans with them when they leave their jobs.
\
Stephen has criticized Bradley's willingness to propose and vote for earmarks. Bradley defended the practice. He said earmarks were the only way that he was able to provide night-vision goggles to Marines who needed them.
\
He said earmarks might be the only way to keep the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard open in the future. Bradley said one of the highlights of his two terms was helping to take the shipyard off the federal government's closure list in August 2005.
\
""The Navy hasn't really changed its perspective on wanting to close Portsmouth, so the way that they'll try to do it is to starve modernization funding,"" he said.
\
Bradley said earmarks will be necessary to provide the money to upgrade the shipyard.
\
""Five thousand jobs are at risk,"" he said. ""That's the consequences of a politically motivated pledge (not to use earmarks) that would be disastrous to the state of New Hampshire and the state of Maine.""
\
Bradley also criticized Stephen's record at the state health department, repeating past comments that Stephen failed to pay the state's full obligation to county nursing homes, shifting costs onto local taxpayers, he said.
\
Stephen's campaign has not responded to a request to meet with the Monitor's editorial board.

27,"
U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte said she supports a new federal plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, making her the first Republican senator to back the Environmental Protection Agency rule.
\
The EPA's Clean Power Plan calls for a 32 percent reduction nationwide in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030.
\
It sets individual emission reduction goals for states, and the state's elected officials are confident New Hampshire will meet the target through its participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program.
\
""New Hampshire is well on its way to meeting the goals in this Clean Power Plan,"" said Ayotte, a first-term Republican. ""Obviously, I support doing that through clean energy solutions.""
\
The rule was published in the federal register Friday, after being finalized in August. While Democrats have largely been supportive of the Clean Power Plan, saying it will help improve air quality and protect public health, the GOP has generally opposed it. Republicans argue the carbon-cutting rule will deal a blow to the coal mining industry and represents a breach of the EPA's authority.
\
Twenty-four states - all but two led by Republicans - have filed legal challenges to the EPA rule. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has urged all 50 governors to ignore the emission reduction plan because it raises ""serious legal and policy concerns.""
\
On Monday, several environmental groups praised Ayotte's stance on the Clean Power Plan.
\
""We are thrilled that Senator Kelly Ayotte is standing up to big polluters by joining Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster and Governor Maggie Hassan in supporting the Clean Power Plan,"" said Rob Werner of the League of Conservation Voters New Hampshire. ""Her support for this commonsense plan to cut carbon pollution from coal-burning power plants comes at a critical time as congressional attacks on it are expected to ramp up in the coming weeks.""
\
Ayotte is expected to face off against Hassan in the 2016 Senate race.
\
Over the past several weeks, the state Democratic Party has sought to make environmental issues a key part of the race, accusing her of trying to rewrite her environmental record.
\
Hassan backs the Clean Power Plan, which she said is necessary to protect New Hampshire's environment and economy.
\
At a press conference with Shaheen on Monday, Hassan criticized Ayotte's record, saying she voted in the past to block the EPA's ability to curb carbon emissions.
\
""I am glad this one time she has joined Senator Shaheen and me for this commonsense plan, but her record is very, very poor and doesn't reflect New Hampshire values,"" said Hassan, who recently wrote a letter to the state's congressional delegation urging it to support the Clean Power Plan.
\
Democrats point to Ayotte's support earlier this year of an amendment to block the administration from withholding highway funds from states that refuse to submit an emission reduction plan required by EPA rule.
\
Ayotte stood behind her vote, and said taking highway funds away from New Hampshire isn't the right approach. ""Highway funds are very important, that wasn't the right mechanism to enforce the plan,"" Ayotte said, adding that the EPA has enforcement authority.
\
Ayotte came out in support of the plan now because it was recently finalized, she said. ""I have been examining this for a while and also carefully reviewing it.""
\
She's not sure whether her support will prompt other Republicans to back the plan.
\
""This is something that each senator will make their own individual decision on, most likely because of the impact on their particular state,"" she said. ""For New Hampshire, our environment is such an important part of our economy, we have already taken positive steps that put us well on the way to meeting the goals of this plan.""
\
New Hampshire has one of the more stringent state emission reduction goals, set at 858 pounds of CO2 emissions per megawatt-hour of electricity generation, according to the EPA. It's roughly a 5 percent reduction from the state's 2012 emission rate: 905 pounds per megawatt-hour.

28,"
I can't figure out whether the comments by Obama administration officials regarding small business are the result of a conscious effort to be disingenuous, a reflection of their naivete, or the fact that their total business IQ doesn't have the wattage of a night light.
\
We consistently hear them express dismay as to why these business professionals aren't borrowing gobs of money, hiring legions of new employees and opening lots of plants or branches. Perhaps they would find the answers if they brought a few business-savvy people into the inner workings of the White House.
\
The bureaucrats in Washington are not experts on business. If the federal government were a business, it would have been bankrupt years ago. Their idea of running a business is the post office. It is different when you have everything on the line and you have to balance a budget and even make a profit (a bad word in Washington).
\
When small-business people are thinking of adding personnel, it is a major commitment. They need an environment that is predictable and where there is a long-term expectation that the new hire can help with efficiency or profitability. No one likes laying off personnel, particularly when they are neighbors or friends, so a commitment to hire is not made lightly.
\
New hires are especially difficult in the current environment, and not just because of the economy. Most business people are frozen in their decision-making because of the confusion coming out of Washington. No one knows what is going on regarding regulations, budgetary decisions, tax rules and rates and the ramifications of massive new programs like health care and, possibly, cap and trade.
\
Let's recap what is going on in Washington as directed by both the administration and its cohorts in crime, Congress:
\
Congress passed the 2,500-plus page health care bill without any of the members actually reading the entire thing. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told officials that Congress needed to pass it so everyone could see what's in it. Several months later Congress still doesn't know all the details and ramifications of its bill, and you can be pretty sure that the employers on Main Street don't know either. Many are going to wait for clarification of how it will impact a major expense item on their budgets before they consider adding to it.
\
As much as 40 percent of small business costs are now involved in complying with various government regulations. Here's a news item for Washington: None of these expenses help a company's productivity or profitability. When you are forced to use increasing numbers of your people in this effort, you divert resources from finding ways to grow your business. Congress has been issuing a steady diet of new regulations on top of the already predatory requirements. Bureaucrats and politicians justify their existence with this stuff, but it is another burden to those actually running businesses.
\
Congress has left us wondering what is going on from a fiscal standpoint. There is no federal budget, tax policy is in total chaos, and Washington's answer to out-of-control spending is health care legislation and a non-stimulus stimulus bill, which was basically a bunch of earmarks to pay off political debts.
\
Finally, the image of business in this country has been trashed consistently by the White House. We all know that some large institutions acted stupidly or worse and endangered our whole economy, but most businesses in this country are engaged in reputable commerce and are the foundation of our country's extraordinary economic success. It is not productive to keep trashing capitalism and free markets. The negative vibes are not conducive to small business people wanting to take a lot of chances.
\
The bottom line: Small businesses have enough uncertainty trying to deal with customers and the economy and actually making a profit. (Unlike the government, they can't run with losses forever.)
\
The biggest favors Washington could do for them are:
\
1. Stop piling on new regulatory demands.
\
2. Pass only legislation that Congress and the public can read and understand and afford.
\
3. Clarify the tax laws.
\
4. Make some real effort to get the government's fiscal house in order.
\
5. Leave businesses alone so they can focus on their business.
\
And one more thing: Get a few small-business voices into the administration. How does it make sense to rely on your business advice from the same Wall Street individuals and institutions that caused a lot of the problems initially? That's like having Barney Frank and Chris Dodd write the new bill on financial regulation.

29,"State House Bureau Chief\CONCORD -- The New Hampshire House voted Wednesday to pull the state out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a pollution control program aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions.\By a vote of 246-104, the House followed the advice of the Science, Technology and Energy Committee to end state participation. The bill now moves to the House Finance Committee for a second review.\RGGI is a cap-and-trade program, where companies are limited in how much carbon dioxide they can emit, and are allowed to buy credits in an auction process if they find their carbon emissions exceed allowances. Those that cut their emissions can sell credits at the auction. The RGGI system has brought $28 million to the state for energy efficiency programs over the past two years.\The state would leave the program on Jan. 1, 2012, if the Senate approves the bill as it stands now. Rules would change on how the state distributes funds it collects as part of the RGGI auction process.\Gov. John Lynch said yesterday he opposes the bill.\The program brings funding for energy efficiency through a regional auction of carbon dioxide allowances. Because RGGI affects electric costs throughout the region, the state will continue to pay higher costs, but get none of the funding benefits if it leaves the program, Lynch and RGGI supporters argue.\Lynch said the bill ""would result in New Hampshire ratepayers paying higher electric rates to subsidize efforts to reduce electric bills for customers in other Northeast states ... . Withdrawing from RGGI would be a blow to our economy and to our state's efforts to become more energy efficient and energy independent.""\Estimates are that if the state withdraws from the program, ratepayers will still send $12 million annually to other New England states that would go to their RGGI programs. Average costs of the RGGI program come to 6.5 cents a month for Public Service of New Hampshire residential customers.\Those who favor repeal say the bill represents a hidden tax on all electric bills, while the funds it raises only benefit a select few, often large corporations that could afford energy efficiency projects on their own.\They say it is an expensive byproduct of questionable climate change science.\The state pulled more than $3 million out of the RGGI fund to cover other budget needs, a fact that had critics pointing to it as a virtual piggybank that allows diversion of funds.\Those who fought repeal said the science committee gave it little discussion or thought, simply passing a policy Republicans leaders want in effect.\Rep. Naida Kaen, D-Durham, said repeal would be a ""lose-lose for New Hampshire,"" as higher rates stay in place with no benefit to ratepayers or the environment.\She asked, ""is somebody holding a gun to our head and forcing us to jump off a cliff? Because that's what we're doing -- jumping off without knowing what the consequences are."" She urged that the bill be sent back to the science committee for more study.\Science committee chairman Rep. James Garrity, R-Atkinson, said RGGI supporters were simply trying to hold onto the money the program creates. He described the program as ""a stealth tax on our electric bills."" He said global warming science is ""hype,"" and added, ""RGGI should be repealed now because it rests on shaky economic science, namely, that government should collect money from all of us to distribute the wealth to a few of us.""\House Minority Leader Terie Norelli said the bill ""was an enormous step backward"" for businesses, families, the state budget and the environment.\RGGI backers said the money has largely gone to weatherization of public buildings and private homes, helping reduce electric bills and reliance on foreign oil, and sustaining the ailing construction industry.\Rep. Beatriz Pastor, D-Lyme, who said even if climate change science has only a 50-50 chance of being accurate, steps should be taken to prepare for its results. Nuclear war was not a sure thing in the Cold War, but the U.S. prepared for it anyway, she said.\Noah, she continued, ""could have looked out the window and said 'doesn't look like rain.' "" He prepared, Pastor said.\Rep. Sandra Keans, R-Rochester, accused opponents of the bill of launching a ""cowardly ... sleazy"" series of robo-calls that spread misinformation over the past weekend."

31,"For an administration that proudly announces it likes a crisis, the Obama White House certainly wasn't prepared to manage one. We're just beginning to see the extent of the damage caused by the oil and chemicals filling up the Gulf of Mexico. The foreign oil company responsible for the disaster has been unsuccessful in stopping it, and government exists to step in at precisely such moments.\Our inexperienced President is 18 months into his first leadership position and six weeks into total organizational mismanagement and chaos. This oil disaster should have become his highest priority before the end of Day 1.\President Obama failed to recognize this was a crisis that would not fix itself. His first step should have been to immediately call together all the experts and great minds, asking them to prioritize the feasibility as well as the risks of all possible solutions ranging from civil engineering to petroleum engineering to military solutions. Action plans as well as contingency plans should have been in motion within 48 hours.\This administration claims to care for the environment, pushing its ""cap and trade"" bill and the ""carbon credit"" tax scheme. But on the occasion of a real-life environmental tragedy, the President and his Congress squandered their time berating Wall Street and bickering over Don't Ask, Don't Tell. More damage was done to the planet in those early wasted weeks than centuries of carbon credits could ever rectify.\When the media finally began to turn against him, he decided that trying to do something was less risky than continuing to do nothing. So far, he has made no noticeable contribution toward solving the crisis. These leadership shortfalls are adding to the disaster every hour. No one is in charge, despite repeated declarations to the contrary.\The President's failure to act in a timely manner has caused catastrophic and incalculable damage to the ecology and the economy of the Gulf of Mexico.\The costs of his inaction are readily apparent. We're seeing massive losses of animal and plant life, polluted waters from oil and toxic chemical dispersants and beaches that have been fouled for hundreds of miles.\The spill is just as disastrous for the economy, affecting local industries like fishing, tourism and hospitality and affecting the cost of food nationwide. Small business owners have seen their operations halted, and they're fearful they won't be able to maintain payroll or keep up with loans. The state of Louisiana has provided some assistance, but it needs greater support from the federal government. After all the absurd handouts in the so-called stimulus and bailout bills, why is the administration so hesitant to extend federal assistance where it's actually due?\It's time for our leaders to learn and reset their priorities. In the midst of one of the largest man-made ecological disasters in history, the President went on vacation. Since taking office, he's played more rounds of golf than George W. Bush did in his whole presidency. In fact, President Bush stopped playing golf entirely after an attack in Baghdad in August 2003. It just didn't seem appropriate to him. If President Obama cares so much about the environment and about the small business owners and middle-class people affected by this oil disaster, why is he still jetting around to golf trips and vacations?\Competence is not too much to ask of our elected officials. These actions are within the skill sets of thousands of leaders who have learned their craft in our free enterprise system. Business executives deal with difficulties large and small on a daily basis. Those of us who have honed these skills have a duty to serve.\Over the next six years, we don't know what problems we will face, but we know we will face them. We must send men and women to Washington with clear and successful records of problem solving.\The oil spill is catastrophic, but there's an even bigger mess in Washington, D.C. The government is brazenly corrupt; it's hemorrhaging tax dollars by the trillions; and it's choking the life out of our economy. It has shown no ability to clean up the oil, and I'm certain it won't clean up the cesspool in its own backyard. As your senator, I'll bring the skills, experience, and moral fortitude necessary to scour Washington.\.\Jim Bender is a Hollis businessman. He is running for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate."

Because of climate change, New Hampshire's moose population is struggling - fighting a longer tick season and higher quantities of parasites - and over the past decade it has declined more than 40 percent, said Eric Orff, a New Hampshire wildlife biologist. That's why Orff said he supports the Environmental Protection Agency's recent proposal to cut carbon emissions.
\
""Tonight, I am speaking for the moose,"" Orff said last night at the Concord Public Library during a hearing on the EPA's Clean Carbon Plan, which was released last month.
\
Orff was just one of several state residents to speak in favor of the rule for reasons ranging from cleaner air and fewer asthma attacks to longer ice fishing seasons, healthier oceans and beaches and thriving fish populations.
\
Organizers said the event - put on by several groups including Environment New Hampshire, League of Conservation Voters, Moms Clean Air Force and the Union of Concerned Scientists - was a chance to inform citizens and raise support for the EPA plan, which aims to reduce carbon emissions nationwide by 30 percent from 2005 levels.
\
""This is the most significant action proposed nationally on carbon reduction,"" said Rob Werner, New Hampshire state director of the League of Conservation Voters, before the event. ""We want to create an opportunity for people to comment on it . . . and to generate that support and indicate that to the EPA.""
\
This week the EPA is hosting four official public hearings across the country, in Atlanta, Denver, Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C., to hear feedback on its Clean Power Plan. No official EPA meeting will be held in New Hampshire. But at last night's hearing, an EPA official in attendance outlined the policy and told attendees how to file a comment with the agency.
\
The testimony was also recorded and a transcript will be submitted to the EPA as formal comment.
\
The agency is collecting comment on the draft rule until Oct. 16 and has already received more than 300,000 comments, said Cynthia Greene, the EPA representative at the hearing.
\
At the EPA's official hearing in Washington, D.C., tomorrow, New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services Commissioner Thomas Burack will testify on behalf of the state. The state DES also plans to send in more detailed comments to the EPA in written form.
\
DES officials are still hopeful that New Hampshire's participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program, will allow the state to meet the proposed carbon emissions reductions outlined by the EPA. ""We are still working through the numbers,"" said Mike Fitzgerald of the state DES.

The EPA guidelines set state-specific carbon emission rate targets and outline a variety of ways for states to reach those goals, including energy efficiency programs, renewable energy standards, efficiency improvements to existing power plants, switching to natural gas or several other options.
\
The EPA will issue its final guidance in June 2015. The two-hour public hearing last night attracted more than 70 attendees.
\
Burr Tupper of Trout Unlimited urged the audience to support the carbon reduction plan to help protect against the effects of climate change. ""The water temperatures are rising here in New Hampshire . . . trout and salmon are very sensitive to increases,"" he said. ""We have a rich heritage we need to protect.""
\
Betsy Kinsey, one of the event organizers, said recently she has begun noticing her childhood asthma acting up as summer days get hotter and more smoggy. ""I never used to pay attention to poor air quality days,"" she said. Now, she does.
\
No one at the hearing spoke out against the proposal, but a few offered concerns and others said more steps need to be taken.
\
Joel Huberman of Peterborough said the proposal puts too much emphasis on the use of natural gas - methane - that can be just as detrimental to the environment as coal.
\
Will Abbott of the The Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests praised the EPA plan but said there is more to be done. This ""gets us part of the way; there's a much longer road we have to ride,"" he said. ""We cannot sit back and say that's enough.""

"
33,"New Hampshire Sunday News\Odds favor legislators repealing a state law that forces electric customers to pay more to help cap carbon emissions from power plants, according to those pushing for the change.\Rep. James Garrity, chairman of the House Science, Technology and Energy Committee, expects to conduct hearings in February and puts the odds of repeal at better than 50 percent.\""It'll come down to a philosophical vote for most people: big government versus individual decisions, taxing and redistributing versus letting the economy do its thing,"" said the Atkinson Republican. ""It will be a very interesting debate.""\New Hampshire and nine other states -- through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative -- have capped the amount of carbon dioxide allowed to be released by power producers and have pledged to reduce that amount by 10 percent by 2019. To achieve that, the participating states have developed a joint auction system to offer carbon dioxide allowances to companies producing power that cannot meet those goals through renewable sources.\Money gained from the auctioned allowances is split and used by individual states to award grants to improve energy efficiency and develop clean energy technologies, which in turn, they say, will help reduce greenhouse emissions and lower energy bills.\An average residential customer of Public Service of New Hampshire pays about 6.5 cents a month for those allowances -- or $5 million in total in 2010, according to a utility spokesman.\Jack Ruderman, who heads the sustainable energy division at the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission, said New Hampshire's proceeds from the sale of carbon allowances have totaled about $28 million since December 2008.\New Hampshire's proceeds, excluding administration costs and RGGI membership fees, are distributed through grants. Just this month, the PUC announced $13.4 million in grant awards, including $2 million to the Retail Merchants Association of New Hampshire for businesses to become more energy efficient and reduce energy costs.\Ruderman considers the program beneficial to residents and utility customers.\""First of all, the money benefits all the ratepayers because it helps us reduce our overall energy use, and that in turn should drive down energy prices,"" Ruderman said. ""We all get cleaner air as well.""\Ruderman said he's aware of efforts to overturn the law.\""I think it's pretty high on the agenda for some of the new incoming members,"" he said. ""It's going to be a very hot topic this session.""\Garrity, who opposed the original bill three years ago as unnecessary, said several bill requests had been filed for the current legislative session.\""That sort of carbon fundamentalism that drew the virtual end-of-the-world scenario that emotionally drove this thing was overblown,"" he said.\Political factor\Garrity thinks the new Republican majority in the House will boost the chances of repealing the initiative.\""Just based on the talk in the hallways and chatting with a lot of representatives, I think it's better than 50 percent,"" Garrity said. ""You've got a lot more representatives who philosophically believe the government is not the best way to collect money and redistribute money.""\Leading the repeal effort is Rep. Richard Barry. The Merrimack Republican in 2008 signed on as a co-sponsor to the RGGI bill to make the ""bill less onerous,"" he said.\Now, he's working to repeal the measure.\""I think the government shouldn't be in the business of picking winners and losers,"" Barry said. Businesses that help pay for the allowances through higher electric rates could use that money instead to add jobs or expand, he said.\Ruderman said the state received $14 million from the carbon allowance auctions in 2009 and $9.95 million in 2010.\Bob Scott, director of the air resources division at the state Department of Environmental Services, said reduced energy demand and a shift to cheaper natural gas usage -- with fewer carbon emissions -- are responsible for the reduction in allowance funds collected.\Garrity said the state used $3.1 million in RGGI allowances last budget year ""to try to duct tape the budget.""\He said states have used more than $150 million in RGGI money collectively to balance their budgets.\""That means the ultimate purpose to reinvest in energy efficiency was shortened by that much money, so what's the use if states are going to use it as a means of plunder to balance budgets.""\Jim Roche, president of the Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire, said his group worked in 2008 to make the bill more business-friendly, including capping how much electric ratepayers would be responsible for paying for carbon allowances.\Saying BIA hasn't taken a formal position on the repeal, Roche said: ""There is a lot of frustration among my members that the funds generated by the RGGI program have not been used in a way that would lower carbon emissions as much as possible by incentivizing companies in my membership to do even more than they've already done in energy conservation (and efficiency).""\PSNH neutral\PSNH spokesman Matthew Chagnon said the state's largest electric utility isn't taking sides.\""PSNH will do what legislators and policymakers ultimately decide. We are committed to continuing our efforts to move toward a cleaner energy future in a way that is practical and is in the best interests of our customers. We'll leave it to the policymakers to determine how best to achieve that goal.""\Jessica O'Hare, program associate with Environment New Hampshire, an environmental advocacy organization, said ratepayers would see savings over time.\""It's good for our wallet. It's good for our environment and it's good for our economy,"" O'Hare said.\Without controlling carbon dioxide emissions, people could see duller fall foliage colors, which in turn could harm tourism and the economy, she said.\A University of New Hampshire study in 2008 said the state overall would benefit economically by participating in RGGI if the proceeds from the allowance sales were reinvested in energy efficient efforts to reduce electricity demand.\Rep. Naida Kaen, D-Lee, was the bill's prime sponsor in 2008.\""Let me just say that I honestly believe it is in the state's best interest to continue working collaboratively with the other states in the region,"" Kaen said by e-mail. ""That applies to economic impacts for NH as well as the opportunity to remain connected with our neighboring states. The case can be made separately for RGGI, but also more generally on many fronts. The discussion regarding RGGI will be had, of course, because one or more bills has been introduced on the subject.""\Rep. Neal Kurk, R-Weare, had planned to submit his own repeal bill, but now backs Barry's effort. ""The program hits consumers and business with higher electric costs, making us even less competitive than other areas of the United States, and costing us jobs,"" Kurk said in an e-mail. ""It's unfair to New Hampshire -- and we lose our competitive advantage -- when so many other states and the emerging nations of the world, like China and India, don't participate. A cap-and-trade programs only works when everyone participates.""\Kurk called the chances of repeal ""very good.""\""It's bad economics and worse politics for the state to select industries to support or suppress,"" Kurk said. ""That's the jobs of the market. State subsidies distort the market. Why subsidize Walmart or a homeowner when, if a project makes economic sense, each will do it without state subsidies?"""

The New Hampshire House voted yesterday to withdraw the state from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.
\
The 246-104 vote came over concerns by Democrats that the House Committee on Science, Technology and Energy did not take time to adequately discuss or revise the bill after hearing eight hours of public testimony.
\
""What's the rush? Is someone holding a gun to our heads, forcing us to jump off a cliff? Because that's what we're doing,"" said Rep. Naida Kaen, a Lee Democrat and member of the committee.
\
RGGI is a cap-and-trade program for controlling carbon dioxide emissions. Ten Northeast states participate in the program, which allots carbon allowances to each and then requires power plants to purchase the allowances at auctions. The money from those purchases is used for energy-efficiency projects. So far, the auctions have netted more than $28 million for New Hampshire. The program has cost New Hampshire about $11 million, according to figures provided by Democratic Gov. John Lynch in a letter to the House committee.
\
Lynch said yesterday that he opposes the withdrawal because it will result in New Hampshire ratepayers paying higher costs for electricity without receiving any benefits. Because electricity is sold regionally, New Hampshire ratepayers would still have to pay the higher rates even if the state withdrew, but it would not get money back for energy-efficiency projects.
\
""In effect, this legislation would result in New Hampshire ratepayers paying higher electric rates to subsidize efforts to reduce electric bills for customers in other Northeast states,"" Lynch said. ""Becoming part of RGGI was a bipartisan effort. Withdrawing from RGGI would be a blow to our economy and to our state's efforts to become more energy efficient and energy independent.""
\
The vote was largely along party lines, with a handful of Republicans joining Democrats in opposing the bill. The bill will be sent to the House Finance Committee for further consideration.
\
Those who support withdrawing from RGGI say that the science behind climate change is questionable and that it is not the role of government to take money from ratepayers and use it for favored projects. Science, Technology and Energy Committee Chairman James Garrity said the system relies on ""shaky climate science.""
\
Garrity said RGGI is about money, not the environment.
\
""RGGI is a stealth tax hidden in our electric bills, with the illusion of free money to those who benefit from its funds,"" Garrity said.
\
Garrity said RGGI amounts to an additional government mandate that limits the free market.
\
""RGGI should be repealed because it rests on shaky economic science, that government should collect some money from all of us to redistribute that wealth to a few of us,"" Garrity said. ""The majority believes our constituents' money should remain in their pockets to be spent or saved or invested as they see fit.""
\
Supporters of RGGI say the program addresses climate change and has benefited New Hampshire both environmentally and economically. The state joined RGGI in 2008.
\
Rep. Beatriz Pastor, a Lyme Democrat, said that by the end of 2011, New Hampshire is expected to reap $4.2 million in energy savings for residents and businesses and to reduce 13,200 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. She said the RGGI money has been used to increase energy efficiency in public buildings and private homes and to create new jobs in retrofitting and weatherization.
\
Pastor said there is considerable scientific evidence that links carbon dioxide to climate change. Even if not, she said, why take a chance?
\
""There was never any scientific evidence or certainty Russians were going to nuke this country during the Cold War, yet every U.S. president prepared carefully for that possibility,"" Pastor said. ""Noah, told a natural disaster was about to occur, faced natural uncertainty. He could have said it doesn't look like it's going to rain. Instead, he decided to build the ark, and he saved the human race.""
\
Democrats also questioned the process and politicking surrounding the bill. Kaen said every committee member was allowed to make one statement in committee, with no back-and-forth. An amendment, which delayed the withdrawal until January 2012, was also voted on in committee with little discussion.
\
On Monday, the fiscally conservative national advocacy group Americans for Prosperity launched robocalls targeting specific representatives' districts, urging constituents to call their legislators and tell them to support withdrawing from RGGI. AFP State Director Corey Lewandowski said the group got involved because of an interest in lowering electricity rates and shrinking the size of government. Lewandowski said the program is run by ""unelected bureaucrats"" at the Public Utility Commission, who give money to for-profit businesses that could pay for their own energy upgrades.
\
Lewandowski said the robocalls informed people New Hampshire already received $28 million from ratepayers. The calls said if ratepayers thought their electricity bills were too high, they should contact their representatives.
\
Rep. Sandra Keans, a Rochester Democrat, said she received two dozen calls by people who were patched through directly to her. Keans said the callers did not know her name but had been told to press a number on their phones if they wanted to prevent their electricity bills from increasing.
\
""This was an insidious act to frighten those folks in my district,"" Keans said.
\
Environmental advocates said they were disappointed in the vote and would look to the Senate for reconsideration. Jim O'Brien, executive director of Conservation New Hampshire, echoed Lynch's statements that the state would lose energy-efficiency money without benefiting ratepayers.
\
He added, ""Is that the path we want to go down, that you're no longer regulating a major pollutant in New Hampshire?""
\
Kindergarten
\
The House killed a bill that would have repealed the requirement that school districts offer public kindergarten.
\
""I believe most of us do agree the mandate for public kindergarten was probably unconstitutional and wouldn't be mandated if it came today,"" said Rep. Ralph Boehm, a Litchfield Republican and vice chairman of the House Education Committee.
\
But at the same time, Boehm said, all of the state's school districts now offer kindergarten.
\
""Removing the mandate wouldn't change the result,"" he said. ""I know of no town that would do away with public kindergarten.""
\
In a vote of 213-134 to kill the bill, every Democrat but one opposed the bill, while Republicans were split.
\
The bill was sponsored by Rep. Jonathan Maltz, a Hudson Republican, who argued that the mandate to provide kindergarten is unconstitutional because the state does not fully fund it. Kindergarten was added to the state's definition of an ""adequate education"" in 2007, and the last communities were required to add kindergarten by 2009.
\
Supporters of the bill argued that the decision to have kindergarten should be a matter of local control.
\
""It's a fundamental part of our Republican platform that we support local control of schools because clearly the people running those schools know at least as much about education as we do,"" said Rep. J.R. Hoell, a Dunbarton Republican. ""If we create a system where every school in the state must be uniform, we have eliminated the possibly for experimentation.""
\
Hoell said each school district should be allowed to set its own policies.
\
""The (districts) that excel will be copied, and the ones that fail will be replaced, and that is how improvement is made,"" Hoell said.
\
But Rep. Mary Stuart Gile, a Concord Democrat, cited studies showing the economic and educational benefits of offering public kindergarten. In 1990, Gile said the city of Laconia cut kindergarten in a budget crisis. A class that went without kindergarten consistently had lower grades and needed more individual attention in future years than classes that came before or after it, she said.
\
In addition, Gile said, if the bill passes, districts that want to retain kindergarten would lose state money to support it.
\
""Local property taxes could soar,"" she said.
\
Boehm said the bill would also be unfair, since school districts who accepted a higher level of construction aid that the state earmarked for use for kindergarten would now be able to use those classrooms for nonkindergarten classes.
\
Other business
\
Another bill that gained significant attention from the public would have forced state retirees to pay more for their medical benefits. The bill would shift an additional $10 million in state costs to the retirees, with the amount the retiree has to pay depending on the amount of his or her pension benefits. At least a dozen state retirees handed out fliers yesterday with the heading ""promises,"" arguing that the health benefits were promised to them while they were working.
\
""It takes quite a bite out of retirees,"" said Thea Aloise, a 66-year-old former stock clerk for the Department of Health and Human Services.
\
Aloise said her husband is disabled.
\
""If I have to pay up for my health insurance, we'd practically have to go for assistance,"" she said.
\
The House voted to send the bill back to the committee for more work.
\
In other business, the House overturned the recommendation of the Environment and Agriculture Committee to put $2.5 million into an emergency relief fund for milk producers. Supporters of the bill said it would help struggling farmers in an industry where the federal government sets milk prices. But opponents, who rejected the committee's recommendation in a 112-239 vote, said the state does not have extra money to spend. They said the bill is a way for government to redistribute wealth and bail out one industry.
\
The House also passed a bill establishing a committee to review state participation in federal grant-in-aid programs, which send federal money to the state for specific programs.
\
The bill declares unconstitutional any grants relating to matters ""not included among the defined powers of the federal government."" Republicans supporting the bill said it would stop federal encroachment on state affairs. Opponents said cities and towns would lose federal money, and the committee would be a waste of time and resources.

35,"The New Hampshire Senate soon will have a chance to correct a mistake it made last year when it failed to rid New Hampshire of the pesky and costly Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.\Last year legislators voted to pull New Hampshire out of RGGI, a cap-and-trade scheme in which electric utility rates are raised for the purpose of financing energy-efficiency programs. Supporters portray it as a program that makes polluting utility companies pay to clean the environment. In fact, it is a tax that we all pay to subsidize small-scale energy-savings initiatives favored by politicians.\Alas, Gov. John Lynch vetoed the repeal bill, and the Senate in September failed by a single vote to override the veto.\Now it can make up for that failure. On Wednesday the House again voted to withdraw the state from RGGI. House Speaker Bill O'Brien calls the program ""a backdoor tax,"" and he's right. Most senators realize the truth of that assessment.\The state needs 16 senators to support House Bill 1480 if it is to survive another Lynch veto. As electric utility ratepayers, all of us should hope the Senate can muster the votes.\[Caption]"

Sen. John Sununu's recent attempts to discredit the Sierra Club do nothing less than completely discredit Sununu himself.
\
Just as he did in 2002, Sununu is acting as if he's had an election-year conversion on the environment. Meanwhile, in Washington, Sununu has taken $200,000 from the oil and gas industry and, naturally, he cast a deciding vote to give $13 billion of our tax dollars to them. He also voted down the Climate Stewardship Act of 2003, which would have created a cap-and-trade program for green house emissions.
\
Jeanne Shaheen has called for a real commitment from Washington to invest in cleaner, renewable energy. She knows that global warming threatens some of our best traditions, including our economy by altering the fall foliage season, warming our winters and lowering maple syrup production.
\
Shaheen knows New Hampshire well enough to know its beauty is one of our best resources, and that protecting it is an essential part of the New Hampshire way.
\
Sununu's recent attacks against the Sierra Club are not only troubling, they're down right dangerous. While the Sierra Club and its 45,000 members in New Hampshire have stood up for conservation, Sununu stood up for big oil and voted against progress. Don't fall for the same old politics from Sununu.

37,"AS NEW ENGLANDERS, we have always enjoyed a friendly rivalry with our neighbors, from sports games to college rankings, from who has the best maple syrup to whose ski slopes produce the best winter athletes. But one area where Granite Staters think we always lead the pack is the economy. Gov. Steve Merrill once described New Hampshire as an island of prosperity in a sea of high taxes. We all like to think he's right.So you'll probably be as disappointed as I was to learn that our economy is falling behind Massachusetts, Vermont and even Rhode Island. New figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis show that we had the smallest growth in New England last year and our growth rate actually fell from 2012 to 2013. Rhode Island was recently named by USA Today as one of the worst-run states (47th overall) and it has the highest unemployment in the country. Yet its economy grew faster than ours did in 2013. What does this say about our state's approach to economic development and job growth?Every year that goes by like that is a year in which family budgets are more stretched, people struggle to find good jobs and parents say goodbye to a graduating son or daughter who found a job in another state. This is a problem that has been building for some time, as successive Democratic governors have burdened the state with red tape and taxes.New Hampshire has one of the healthiest populations in the country, but we pay more for health insurance than almost anyone else. This is due in large part to policies that have driven price competition away. Maggie Hassan followed Jeanne Shaheen's lead by embracing Obamacare, which has forced people off their insurance and made them find new doctors and hospitals. These misguided policies are increasing premiums and uncertainty for both small businesses and consumers. They are hurting our economy.New Hampshire has some of the highest energy costs in the country. Onerous red tape schemes, such as the regional cap-and-trade program, known as RGGI, and arbitrary government mandates for renewable energy are driving up the cost of electricity for businesses and homeowners. If we want companies to expand and move here, we need to make it more affordable.Unfortunately, I don't believe that our current governor shares the aspirations most Granite Staters have for New Hampshire. She wants to maintain the status quo and for us to believe that flat growth and minimal job creation is sustainable.The contrast between us could not be more clear. I will have a singular goal as governor: to grow our economy. I'll apply 30 years of business experience to restore a common-sense, conservative approach to government and establish priorities to dramatically improve our economic environment.We can cut red tape, reduce the tax burden on small businesses, make it easier for entrepreneurs to start new companies, and align our state's learning centers with the goals of our industry. I will make it a priority to reduce the size of government to ensure that tax dollars are used wisely so that spending does not grow faster than our economy. Above all, I'll keep my promise to never introduce a sales or income tax by vigorously opposing any policy which might lead to one.I know that we face a long list of challenges: ensuring that everyone has access to affordable health care, caring for an aging population, and improving our education system. But until our economy is growing, we can't possibly tackle them and be successful. More than anything else, economic growth raises people into better paying jobs and strengthens middle class families.New Hampshire doesn't need to elect another politician to manage our decline, we need a leader with a new vision for our future.Imagine what New Hampshire could be. Imagine a New Hampshire with the fastest-growing economy in the region. Imagine a New Hampshire that adds jobs by 30 percent every decade. Imagine a New Hampshire that's famous as a destination for high-tech companies. Imagine a New Hampshire in which our young people graduate and stay.No offense to our friends in Vermont, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, but we should be doing a lot better than them. I want to make New Hampshire the engine of economic growth in the Northeast and the best place in the country in which to live, work, raise a family and do business. That's my vision for our state. Together, we can make it reality..\Walt Havenstein of Alton is running for the Republican nomination for governor.\Credit: By WALT HAVENSTEIN"
38,"Texas Gov. Rick Perry said Saturday that as President he might send U.S. troops to Mexico to help authorities there destroy violent drug lords.\""It may require our military in Mexico working in concert with them to kill these drug cartels and to keep them off of our border and to destroy their networks,"" Perry said at a campaign stop in Manchester at the home of Ovide Lamontagne, a Republican candidate for governor.\At an earlier town hall meeting in Hampton, Dave Connors of Hampton said he couldn't understand a policy that gives the children of illegal immigrants in-state tuition to state schools.\Perry said no other Republican candidate has been stronger on securing the border or other issues related to immigration in Texas. He referenced several pieces of legislation he signed or help pass in his home state, as examples of his tough stance on the issue.\He said he vetoed a bill that would have allowed illegal immigrants to have a driver's license in Texas, sent more than $400 million to the border with Mexico in the form of Texas Ranger Recon Teams, helped pass a voter ID bill in Texas, and also put legislation into place that clearly states Texas will do everything in its power to secure the border.\""That brings us to the real issue here, which is we have, for decades, had a federal government that has absolutely failed in a constitutional way to defend our borders,"" Perry said.\He said the federal government ""forces"" Texas to provide health care and schooling for individuals, regardless of their immigration status.\Facts like this forced the state to take action, he said.\""Are we going to have them on the government dole over here, because they are not educated, or are we going to have them in our institutions of higher learning paying in-state tuition, pursuing citizenship?"" asked Perry.\He said it was the best decision for Texas.\""The other 49 states, I not only respect, but also defend the right for them to deal with these issues as they see fit,"" Perry said.\He also reaffirmed his stance on global warming, saying he does not believe it is caused by man.\""What is true is that our temperatures have gone up and down for millennia, and the real issue is: Should America jeopardize its economy with a cap-and-trade type of legislation and base it on science that is still not settled?""\Perry also addressed the economy and talked about job creation in Texas, where he said 40 percent of the nation's jobs have been created since 2009. He said that was attained by showing fiscal restraint, having a tax policy that does not rely on job creators, a regulatory environment that is fair and predictable and a legal system that helps stop frivolous lawsuits.\""Our country is in trouble. I don't think anyone would dispute that fact. When 1 out of 6 work-eligible Americans cannot find a job, that is not an economic recovery, that is an economic tragedy,"" Perry said.\He said over-regulation is ""strangling"" the nation, as is over-taxation and over-litigation.\He said America needs to get its confidence back, and the best way to do that is by lessening the burden on small business owners.\Margaret Schoenberger of North Hampton said she was ""pleasantly surprised"" at Perry's visit, after witnessing some awkward moments during GOP debates. She said in the smaller venue he was able to more fully explain some of his positions. Although wearing a Perry for President sticker, like many others in the room, Schoenberger said she was still ""shopping around"" for a candidate to support.\""But he did an impressive job today,"" she said.\Credit: By GRETYL MACALASTER Sunday News Correspondent"

Gov. John Lynch let a bill become law over the weekend that reforms New Hampshire's involvement in a regional cap-and-trade program, a move that disappointed environmental activists who say it halves energy efficiency funding generated by the multi-state compact.
\
""Keeping New Hampshire in RGGI has been a priority for the governor, and this bill does that,"" Colin Manning, spokesman for the Democratic governor, said in a statement. ""This change in how we use RGGI funding will not allow us to be as effective in our energy efficiency efforts as we have been the previous three years, but it does keep New Hampshire in RGGI, which is why the governor allowed this bill to become law without his signature.""
\
Earlier this month, the bill passed the Republican-controlled Legislature with veto-proof majorities in the House and Senate. Many Republicans argue the RGGI program acts as a built-in tax passed down to consumers - about 45 cents on an average homeowner's monthly energy bill, according to a state report - and last year the House refused to accept legislation that did not completely remove New Hampshire from the program, which is intended to reduce power plants' carbon emissions 10 percent by 2018.
\
The Senate didn't have the votes for complete repeal over Lynch's veto. But this year, once the House agreed to reforms reducing the program's impact in New Hampshire instead of outright repeal, the Senate also would have enough votes to override a veto by Lynch.
\
The bill now says that New Hampshire will not withdraw from the program unless two other New England states - or a New England state with 10 percent of the energy load of the participating New England states - decide to leave first. Senate President Peter Bragdon, a Milford Republican who supported New Hampshire joining the program in 2008, had argued that unilaterally withdrawing New Hampshire from RGGI would have hurt New Hampshire ratepayers by continuing to pay elevated energy prices without reaping the program's benefits.
\
The bill now diverts RGGI revenue from the state Public Utilities Commission to utility-run energy efficiency programs and returns some money that would have been used for energy efficiency to ratepayers in the form of rebates.
\
Jessica O'Hare, an advocate with Environment New Hampshire, released a statement yesterday that said, to date, RGGI has provided $27 million in energy efficiency resources to businesses, mu-nicipalities and homeowners.
\
""RGGI has been a key part of New Hampshire's plan to reduce pollution and move toward clean energy,"" O'Hare said. ""While we are encouraged that our cornerstone clean energy program will live to see another day, we are disappointed that some members of our Legislature voted to cut energy efficiency funding from RGGI in half.""

A few weeks ago, after conducting a multi-year study funded in fair measure by the ultra-conservative billionaire Koch brothers, University of California professor Richard Muller, one of the more credible skeptics of global warming, announced his findings. The great majority of scientists who claimed that the world's climate was warming at a fair clip, Muller said, are right.
\
Muller's findings produced a gamut of responses. In climate skeptic circles, he had committed apostasy. In the broader scientific community the reaction was essentially, ""What took you so long? Didn't you notice that the glaciers are disappearing, permafrost melting, sea level rising and polar bears drowning?""
\
Last month, nine Democrats in the U.S. House decided to swim upstream through the sewage that is Washington politics to introduce the Save Our Climate Act, a bill that would impose, at its onset, a $10 per ton tax on carbon dioxide emissions. Their goal is to reduce emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels.
\
In the current political climate, for such a bill to stand a chance, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's ice cream cone would have to melt all over his hand before he could raise it to his mouth. But the act's proponents shouldn't give up. With a presidential race under way and major contenders like Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney campaigning on ""drill, baby, drill"" platforms, it's the perfect time to offer an alternative vision of America's energy future.
\
The climate act, whose chief sponsor is California Democratic Rep. Pete Stark, would raise a whopping $2.6 trillion over the next decade, most of which would be rebated to energy users who would pay more for power that was produced with less harm to the environment. The rest of the money would go toward deficit reduction, spending that will reduce the tax burden on future generations. To prevent the tax from imposing an unfair disadvantage on American companies, the bill wisely calls for the carbon tax to be applied in tariff form to imported goods.
\
A carbon tax, compared to cap-and-trade systems like the regional compact that New Hampshire participates in, is easy to administrate. It requires minimal bureaucracy, is less easy to game and is a more direct means of reducing emissions. Emit more carbon dioxide and pay more in taxes; switch to a cleaner form of power, pay less.
\
The climate is warming and would continue to heat up if all carbon emissions were curtailed tomorrow. The question is how hot will it get and how soon. The nation, indeed the world, is engaged in a race between the technology required to produce energy without fueling climate change and the technology required to extract fossil fuels long thought too expensive to recover.
\
At the moment fossil fuel recovery technology is winning. Vast supplies of natural gas are being tapped, deep-water oil fields developed and Canada's vast supply of oil locked in tar sands extracted. The profits from the development of those energy resources will go to investors, but the added harm from global warming will be paid by everyone. A tax on carbon would recognize that harm, raise money to mitigate it, and make alternative forms of energy more competitive economically. It's a tax that's long overdue.

New Hampshire wouldn't withdraw from a multi-state cap-and-trade compact under a reform bill passed yesterday by the Senate, but advocates say the move weakens a program that is succeeding in promoting clean energy.
\
For the second year in a row, the House passed a bill seeking to remove New Hampshire from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, but Senate Majority Leader Jeb Bradley offered up the same amendment as last year that continues the program but changes the way it operates in the state.
\
""We are in deja vu,"" Bradley, a Wolfeboro Republican, said before the Senate voted 18-6 to pass the bill as amended.
\
The Senate amendment takes state revenue earned by auctioning off carbon allowances to power plants - money that is currently distributed as grant funding for energy efficiency projects by the state Public Utilities Commission - and puts it into an energy efficiency fund controlled by utility companies, Bradley said. The bill also lowers the rebate threshold on auction proceeds so money that would have been spent by companies to purchase carbon allowances is used to slightly reduce rates for customers.
\
Though the Senate version does not have the outright repeal provision desired by the House, it does provide a mechanism for New Hampshire to leave the program if it is preceded by the withdrawal of two other New England states, or one state carrying 10 percent of the energy load between the New England states participating in the program.
\
The goal of RGGI, which Gov. John Lynch signed into law in 2008, is to reduce carbon emissions 10 percent by 2018. Environmental activists criticized yesterday's Senate vote.
\
""We are disappointed that some of our senators voted to weaken our cornerstone clean energy program,"" said Jessica O'Hare, a spokesman for Environment New Hampshire. ""RGGI is helping to lower our energy bills, improve our energy independence, and reduce pollution. This bill effectively slashes our energy efficiency funding in half.""
\
Sen. Amanda Merrill, a Durham Democrat, said the amendment would ""sacrifice what is a robust grant program for extremely limited ratepayer relief,"" about a 20-cent reduction to the average homeowner's monthly bill. A state report last year showed New Hampshire has taken in $33 million in revenue from the program.
\
""I think the amendment unnecessarily modifies a program that's working,"" Merrill said. Sen. John Gallus of Berlin was the lone Republican to join all five Senate Democrats in opposition to the bill.
\
Last year, the House refused to go along with the Senate's amendment, with Rep. Jim Garrity, the Atkinson Republican who heads the House Science, Energy and Technology Committee, saying at the time ""the only way to fix it is to get rid of it."" Garrity changed his tune this year, saying he and House Speaker Bill O'Brien were willing to consider whatever the Senate decided.
\
As the bill now goes back to the House, Garrity said he and other House leaders were not yet sure if they would concur with the Senate's amendment.
\
""House leadership will have to put our heads together and decide,"" he said.

Five years in, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative isn't working out the way its supporters said it would, and they want to make drastic changes to the program in order to get state revenue flowing again.
\
When New Hampshire entered into the 10-state compact in 2008, the economy was on the verge of recession. One minor benefit of our half-decade in the economic doldrums is that it mitigated the impact of the RGGI program on ratepayers. The program has had absolutely no effect on the environment, but it has done so while costing much less than it could have.
\
Under RGGI, 10 northeastern states agreed to cap the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from a group of fossil fuel power plants and auction off the right to emit CO2 through a series of quarterly auction. Proceeds from the sale of CO2 allowances would go back to the states, which would use the revenue to fund energy efficiency and weatherization programs.
\
The fatal flaw of RGGI's first five years is the same problem at the core of all central planning. The very smart, very well-meaning people who designed the interstate carbon trading compact could not anticipate the large shifts in the regional electricity market that swamped any impact RGGI had.
\
The first year went according to plan. The price of a CO2 allowance fluctuated between $3 and $4. That generated revenue above $100 million each of the first three auctions in which all 10 state participated. New Hampshire brought in nearly $12.5 million in that period, using some of the revenue to cover one of then-Gov. John Lynch's many budget crises, some to fund the state's weatherization program, and the rest of set up the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Fund., administered by the Public Utilities Commission.
\
The GHGERF wasn't just a horrible acronym. It was also a prime example of what happens when unelected state officials are given the power to make appropriations. They awarded money to Dartmouth College and Dannon subsidiary Stonyfield Yogurt to pay for capital improvements that would lower their electric bills. Some would argue that an Ivy League college and an international food conglomerate could afford their own energy upgrades. Millions more went to green energy consultants. The PUC even gave grants to many of the groups advising them on how to spend RGGI money.
\
The PUC handed out more awards in RGGI's first two years than the program could fund in three. While the PUC was writing checks, RGGI was melting down.
\
The recession and falling natural gas prices resulted in less demand for coal-fired electricity, and that meant power producers were going to come in well below the RGGI carbon cap.
\
Imagine playing musical chairs, with 10 chairs and only seven players. Since you know there are going to be plenty of seats when the music stops, there isn't much urgency. Likewise, the market for RGGI allowances collapsed, and the secondary trading market disappeared.
\
The RGGI auction price has remained at or near the price floor since June 2010, and the number of bidders has dropped from 84 to a low of just 29. In the September 2011 auction, 82 percent of the allowances on the block went unsold, even at the floor price. A quarter to a half of allowances offered are routinely unsold. Low prices and low volume have meant much lower state revenue, and that means less money for New Hampshire's Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Fund.
\
While Gov. Chris Christie took New Jersey out of RGGI two years ago, the remaining states are hoping to boost RGGI revenue by dramatically lowering the carbon cap. Their recent proposal would cut the CO2 emissions allowed by 45 percent next year, with annual cuts of 2.5 percent for the next four years.
\
Limiting supply would seemingly prompt higher demand. Power plants would be forced into a bidding war for the few carbon allowances on the market, and states would get more money. All of these costs would ultimately be borne by ratepayers.
\
RGGI supporters will again claim that lower CO2 emissions would help combat climate change. That's hogwash. The 45 percent cut would lower covered emissions by about 70 million tons per year, which certainly sounds like a lot. Until you remember that total U.S. emissions, from fossil fueled electricity along, are 6.8 billion tons annually. That doesn't include transportation, agriculture, or the rest of the world. RGGI could not possibly make any measurable difference in global CO2 concentrations.
\
RGGI was never designed to actually do anything about climate change. It was designed as a model for national cap-and-trade legislation, and as a revenue stream for green energy lobby.
\
As the Legislature considers whether or not to lower the RGGI carbon cap, it should be honest with us about how the program actually works.

New Hampshire's 2nd Congressional District stretches from Massachusetts to Canada, and Maine to the Connecticut River. The three candidates running for the Republican nomination this year - state Rep. Marilinda Garcia of Salem, former state senator Gary Lambert of Nashua and former state representative Jim Lawrence of Hudson - have contained their conversation to several key issues.
\
Affordable Care Act
\
??Garcia: ""A lot of things have taken root at this time, so I've talked about dismantling some things that I think are more odious, such as the individual mandate, the employer mandate, the medical device tax. . . . Sure, there are some good things, the coverage for pre-existing conditions, the move to electronic medical records, and coverage for young people up to 26.""
\
??Lambert: ""I'm for repeal of the entire system, 'cause I think it's all broken. . . . There are some things we can all agree are good reforms, and repeal doesn't mean we can't do those things outside of Obamacare. I believe in the free market, I also believe there's a time and a place for government. The world is not black and white. There is some gray and that is a place where we can come to agreement on what folks want to see in health care.""
\
??Lawrence: ""I would be in favor of repealing it. The system, as imperfect as it was before, seemed to service the people of this state better than what we have now. I'd like to see more competition, to see people allowed to purchase insurance across state lines. . . . There was a small percentage of individuals that weren't being serviced correctly. We blew up the entire system for those individuals when that could be addressed without the large affordable health care options.""
\
Energy and Northern Pass
\
??Garcia said she would support Northern Pass if the lines were buried, and that the government should not ""create disincentives for people to care for the environment on their own."" She also voted to withdraw the state from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Programs like RGGI ""increase bureaucracy, increase taxes, increase rates, make it more difficult for these things to be tested in a true private market,"" she said.
\
??Lambert would consider supporting the Northern Pass project if the lines were buried. He has been attacked by his opponents for voting against withdrawing the state from RGGI, but he says he would oppose a national cap-and-trade or carbon tax program. ""What's right for New Hampshire is making sure we don't have the government picking winners and losers. If wind works for someone, that's wonderful, but I don't believe the government ought to be involved in that,"" he said.
\
??Lawrence opposes all current proposals for the Northern Pass project. He also opposed RGGI while in the House, but was absent the day in 2008 the House voted to enter the program, according to state records.
\
Job growth
\
??Garcia said on her website the role of government in promoting job growth is in ""ensuring property rights are protected, basic infrastructure is built and rule of law is enforced.""
\
??Lambert said the role of government is to ensure the success of high-tech employers offering high-paying jobs. He also believes in the need for higher education. ""I'm a big fan of the community college system,"" he said. ""Manufacturers want to see those places train people so they can go in and start working. We can help the community college system to make sure they do everything possible to succeed.""
\
??Lawrence: ""Every congressman and senator has a staff to answer their phones. They could say anything. My staff will answer the phone and say, 'Congressman Jim Lawrence's office, from New Hampshire, a great place to do business.' We need to take advantage of these free opportunities to market our state.""
\
Abortion
\
??Garcia voted while in the House to end public funding for abortions and require parental notification before a minor receives an abortion, with no exception for maternal health, victims of rape, incest or abuse. At a debate last month, she said she would support the over-the-counter sale of birth control pills. ""That would be a great move, especially as we see how Obamacare will lead to rationing, and a lack of medical providers in areas where (physicians) are already hard pressed to see all the patients seeking their attention,"" she said.
\
??Lambert, while in the Senate, supported requiring parental notification for minors seeking abortion procedures and supported a ban on partial birth abortions. He voted for an interim study on a bill that would allow employers to deny coverage for contraception based on the employer's personal beliefs, effectively helping kill that bill. He said he supports the Supreme Court's decision that closely held corporations do not have to offer employees coverage for contraception.
\
??Lawrence, while in the House, supported requiring parental notification for minors seeking abortion procedures and supported a ban on partial birth abortions.

More than a year ago, the U.S. Supreme Court delivered a stinging rebuke to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for refusing even to consider invoking its authority under the Clean Air Act to address the most pressing environmental problem of this or any other era: global climate change. ""EPA has offered no reasoned explanation for its refusal to decide whether greenhouse gases cause or contribute to climate change,"" wrote Justice John Paul Stevens, concluding that the EPA had acted in an ""arbitrary"" and ""capricious"" manner.
\
Now that every state from Delaware to Maine - 10 in all - has moved forward with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative by conducting an initial auction of carbon emissions allowances under the new RGGI cap-and-trade program, it is worth taking stock of how the federal agency tasked with protecting the air has progressed since the court's decision.
\
The answer is scary.
\
The EPA recently issued hundreds of pages of legal analysis describing how it could use its authority under the Clean Air Act to address global warming. But an accompanying statement from EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson made clear his distaste for the prospect. He called the Clean Air Act ""an outdated law"" that is ""ill-suited for the task of regulating global greenhouse gases."" He concluded that EPA action ""would inevitably result in a very complicated, time-consuming and, likely, convoluted set of regulations.""
\
To be fair, Johnson's comments can be interpreted as a challenge to Congress to make explicitly clear that the Clean Air Act, which dates from 1970, requires a decisive response to an environmental issue that was not on the nation's radar screen 38 years ago. But we should expect more from regulators, at every level of government, than that.
\
Yes, bureaucrats like Johnson should defer to and respect the legislative bodies that created their agencies. But they should also remember the reason legislatures invent regulatory bodies rather than simply making every decision themselves.
\
Many of the toughest public policy problems we confront, global warming prominent among them, require scientific and technical expertise that sensible legislators know they lack.
\
Moreover, the hot-button vicissitudes of the partisan political world are ill-suited to solving problems like climate change.
\
As an example, consider the written comments filed with the EPA by CNP Action, affiliated with the conservative Council for National Policy.
\
If the EPA used its Clean Air Act authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, wrote Shaun Waymire of CNP Action, it would impose ""undue hardship upon Americans already struggling with high gas prices, by forcing them to either replace their current lawnmowers, weed whackers, power generators, etc. or find a way to make them meet government emissions requirements. . . . I cringe at the thought of a federal agency dictating to the American people how to use their everyday property."" (At least he didn't complain, as Justice Antonin Scalia did in his dissent to Justice Stevens, that ""everything airborne, from Frisbees to flatulence,"" is now subject to EPA regulation.)
\
Like the EPA administrator, CNP Action is also talking to Congress - at a highly charged time when political discourse has degenerated into arguments about lipstick on pigs. In these circumstances, it is the moral duty of regulators, by virtue of their professional and technical expertise, to make clear that addressing climate change is not about taking away people's weed whackers but is, in fact, about grim realities like uncontrolled CO2 emissions from coal-burning electric plants.
\
It has been 10 years since a petition from environmental groups forced EPA to begin considering the possibility of regulating greenhouse gasses under the Clean Air Act. What the EPA did in June was simply announce that it was renewing the process, in the wake of the Supreme Court's 2007 decision, by seeking public comment through some time in November, after the election.
\
Whoever wins, it is time for some regulatory courage.

I just read another one of those ""Ban the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative"" columns, frequently written by groups that have billions invested in fossil fuel consumption. According to industry naysayers, RGGI is bad for business. This is true only if you are in the business of selling energy to New Hampshire. As president of LighTec Inc., a New Hampshire energy efficiency company, I'd like readers to hear about the benefit of RGGI to our municipalities and businesses, enabling job-creating growth while reducing greenhouse gases.
\
Are RGGI's opponents suggesting a better idea, one that would be as environmentally responsible and curb the annual drain of more than $3 billion from our economy? Are they forgetting that this is a regional initiative? If we withdraw, the state will lose a valuable source of revenue.
\
RGGI is the nation's first market-based cap-and-trade program to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It uses the money raised by auctioning pollution rights to subsidize energy efficiency programs that lead to further reductions in C02 output.
\
Good for the region
\
RGGI is a smart idea to help manage an intractable, long-term energy and environmental problem. Furthermore RGGI is good for New Hampshire and the entire Northeast and Mid-Atlantic region, which is increasingly energy-scarce. We have no easily extractable fossil energy sources in New England. This is not how we make our livings. New Hampshire is a state with a highly educated and innovative workforce, trained by some of America's best colleges and universities. Our RGGI law helps this army of engineers, entrepreneurs, and trades people start companies and jobs in fast-growing energy efficiency professions.
\
Increased energy efficiency is our most cost-effective way to stay competitive in the region and world, while saving money. It makes no economic sense for a state burdened with high electricity and fossil fuel prices to repeal a law that invests in lowering our need for high-priced energy. RGGI funds go directly into creating jobs that will reduce our energy dependence and make our manufactured products more competitive in world markets.
\
RGGI, along with electric utility efficiency programs, have proved that investments in energy efficiency are the best way to reduce electricity costs.
\
New Hampshire's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is performing a clearly measurable economic benefit to New Hampshire municipalities, home owners and businesses. Killing RGGI would be harmful to New Hampshire's economic growth.
\
Taxpayer savings
\
Let me give you a sense of where some of the RGGI money has been invested. Consider the town of Hollis, where the selectmen and school board approved an energy efficiency project that had been stalled for three years. Only 12 percent of project cost was picked up by RGGI but allowed the project to go forward. The resulting energy improvements to the Hollis schools and town buildings freed up over 150 kilowatts of electricity demand and will provide Hollis an annual savings of $63,000. This is equivalent to removing the electricity load of 30 residential homes from New Hampshire's power distribution system. Did I mention the emissions reductions? Hollis will reduce greenhouse gas pollution by 200 tons per year.
\
The taxpayers of Hollis are far from alone in receiving big energy cost reductions from RGGI. Many other towns, school districts and business are doing likewise.
\
Although RGGI was not expressly intended to be an integral part of the New Hampshire's resource and economic development policy, this can become the reality.
\
Recently George Bald, commissioner of the Department of Resources and Economic Development, pointed out that New Hampshire's economic growth and resource policy go hand in hand. New Hampshire's natural resource is its environment.
\
It is no accident that outdoor sports companies like Eastern Mountain Sports and the Timberland Co. are headquartered in New Hampshire. A law that reduces pollution, under any name, helps keep this economic advantage alive and well.
\
If New Hampshire withdraws from membership in RGGI, the only winners are out-of-state energy suppliers that would hate to lose the $3 billion per year that flows out of our economy and into theirs.
\
A sound energy policy for a state that imports 90 percent of its energy, must be one that is focused on using energy efficiently. With such a compelling reason to keep the RGGI energy efficiency program alive and functional, why would anyone want to kill it?

President Obama's new pollution limits for power plants have set off an avalanche of information about what the rules will cost, how they will affect your health and how far they will go toward curbing climate change.
\
There's just one problem: Almost none of it is based in reality.
\
That's because Obama's proposed rules, which aim to cut carbon dioxide emissions from power plants 30 percent by 2030, rely on states developing their own customized plans to meet their targets. Among the options are switching to cleaner fuel sources, boosting efficiency to reduce demand for electricity and trading pollution permits through cap and trade.
\
At the earliest, states won't submit plans until mid-2016; some states could have until 2018. So the true impact won't be known for years.
\
But that's not stopping the White House, environmental groups and the energy industry from serving up speculation in heaping doses.
\
What we know and don't know about the effects of the pollution rules:
\
Electricity prices
\
The Obama administration says: The proposal will shrink electricity bills about 8 percent.
\
Supporters of energy deregulation say: ""Americans can expect to pay $200 more each year for their electricity."" - Institute for Energy Research, a group backed by the Koch brothers.
\
The reality: It depends how you crunch the numbers. The administration acknowledges that the price per kilowatt hour will go up a few percentage points. But the administration says your total power bill will be lower because the plan incentivizes efficiency and will drive down demand. In other words, you'll pay more for the electricity you buy, but you'll buy less of it.
\
The environment
\
Environmentalists say: ""This is the biggest step we've ever taken for the biggest challenge we've ever faced."" - League of Conservation Voters
\
The coal industry says: ""The proposal will have practically no effect on global climate change."" - American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity
\
The reality: The plan would prevent about 430 million tons of carbon from reaching the atmosphere. It's a 30 percent cut over the next 15 years, but that's compared with 2005 levels. Since 2005, power plans have cut those emissions nearly 13 percent, so they're already about halfway toward the goal.
\
But U.S. fossil-fueled plants account for only 6 percent of global carbon emissions, and Obama's plan doesn't touch the rest of the world's emissions. It won't cut as big a chunk as Obama's previous fuel economy rules for cars and trucks.
\
The economy
\
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says: The plan will cost the economy more than $50 billion per year.
\
The administration says: By 2030, the rules will have an annual cost of up to $8.8 billion, but that cost will be far offset by annual climate and health benefits of up to $93 billion.
\
The reality: We won't know until states decide how to meet their targets. Some states rely more heavily on coal, so different regions will be affected in different ways. Still, it's a safe bet that companies that produce natural gas, solar panels or renewable technologies will get a boost, while coal will take a hit.
\
To calculate health care savings, the administration uses a somewhat morbid formula that puts a dollar amount on ailments averted - everything from heart attacks to bronchitis and asthma. It's an inexact science, and there are plenty of caveats.
\
Jobs
\
The conservative Heritage Foundation says: ""Nearly 600,000 jobs would be lost.""
\
The United Mine Workers of America says: ""We estimate that the total impact will be about 485,000 permanent jobs lost.""
\
The Environmental Protection Agency says: The rules could cost close to 80,000 jobs by 2030 at power plants and fossil fuel companies, but could create about 111,000 jobs in energy efficiency.
\
The reality: It's tough to tell. Not every coal miner who loses a job will find work installing solar panels and windmills. On the other hand, the low cost of natural gas has already prompted a shift away from coal, meaning some of those jobs will disappear with or without new pollution limits.
\
Public health
\
The EPA says: Up to 6,600 premature deaths, 150,000 asthma attacks in children and close to half a million sick days will be averted.
\
The American Lung Association says: ""Cleaning up carbon pollution from power plants will save lives and have an immediate, positive impact on public health.""
\
The coal industry says: ""The White House continues to perpetuate the nonexistent linkage between EPA's new carbon regulations and public health."" - American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity
\
The reality: Even the EPA says that the quantitative health benefits of the new rule are ""illustrative examples."" It's true that carbon dioxide emissions aren't directly linked to health problems like asthma. But because the rule will decrease the amount of electricity made from burning coal, it will help reduce other pollutants that coal-fired power plants release. Those pollutants create smog and soot, which do cause health problems.
\
Critics contend the administration is ""double counting"" those benefits.

The RGGI auction price has remained at or near the price floor since June 2010, and the number of bidders has dropped from 84 to a low of just 29. In the September 2011 auction, 82 percent of the allowances on the block went unsold, even at the floor price. A quarter to a half of allowances offered are routinely unsold. Low prices and low volume have meant much lower state revenue, and that means less money for New Hampshire's Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Fund.
\
While Gov. Chris Christie took New Jersey out of RGGI two years ago, the remaining states are hoping to boost RGGI revenue by dramatically lowering the carbon cap. Their recent proposal would cut the CO2 emissions allowed by 45 percent next year, with annual cuts of 2.5 percent for the next four years.
\
Limiting supply would seemingly prompt higher demand. Power plants would be forced into a bidding war for the few carbon allowances on the market, and states would get more money. All of these costs would ultimately be borne by ratepayers.
\
RGGI supporters will again claim that lower CO2 emissions would help combat climate change. That's hogwash. The 45 percent cut would lower covered emissions by about 70 million tons per year, which certainly sounds like a lot. Until you remember that total U.S. emissions, from fossil fueled electricity along, are 6.8 billion tons annually. That doesn't include transportation, agriculture, or the rest of the world. RGGI could not possibly make any measurable difference in global CO2 concentrations.
\
RGGI was never designed to actually do anything about climate change. It was designed as a model for national cap-and-trade legislation, and as a revenue stream for green energy lobby.
\
As the Legislature considers whether or not to lower the RGGI carbon cap, it should be honest with us about how the program actually works.

"
49,".Electricity bills: Cap reduction would mean increase for ratepayers.\The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative involving New Hampshire and eight other states wants to reduce the cap for carbon emissions by 45 percent in 2014, the organization announced Thursday.\If approved by the nine states, allowable carbon-dioxide output for 2014 would drop from 165 million tons to 91 million tons, according to a news release issued by the New York-based Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. RGGI is also calling for subsequent reductions of 2.5 percent per year from 2015 to 2020.\""Today, we are taking another significant step forward in realizing our common goal of reducing carbon emissions, driving energy efficiency investments, accelerated clean energy deployment and providing economic benefits to the region's businesses and families,"" said Collin O'Mara, chairman of RGGI and the top environmental regulator in Delaware, a RGGI state.\The first of its kind in the country, RGGI is a nine-state market-based effort to reduce greenhouse gases. Polluters such as coal and natural gas plants must purchase allowances to emit carbon-dioxide. Money raised from the allowance auctions is funneled into energy efficiency, renewable energy projects and, in the case of New Hampshire, lower electricity rates.\RGGI has had a difficult go in New Hampshire. Two years ago, the Republican-dominated Legislature passed legislation to force new Hampshire out of RGGI. It was successfully vetoed by then-Gov. John Lynch.\Last year, Lynch let RGGI-related legislation become law without his signature. It calls for New Hampshire to withdraw from RGGI if two other New England states exit. It also earmarks some of RGGI funds to reductions in electricity bills.\Program 'a failure'\Thursday, the New Hampshire office of Americans for Prosperity said the program was a failure, noting that December permits sold for the minimum, $1.93 bid, and 48 percent were unsold.\""It's time to remove our state from this failed cap-and-trade program and take away this burden from New Hampshire individuals and small businesses,"" said Corey R. Lewandowski, state director of Americans for Prosperity-New Hampshire, in a statement.\""Today's proposal to significantly reduce the number of permits available demonstrates the failure of the RGGI program.""\The latest recommendations must be approved by each state before they become effective. In New Hampshire, they must be passed by the Legislature and signed by the governor, said Mike Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Services.\RGGI operates on the theory that reductions in the amount of available emission allowances increases the price of the allowances and makes carbon-emitting energy production more expensive. Average carbon emissions from 2009 to 2011 are 30 percent off the carbon emissions in 2005, RGGI said.\Grant Bosse, the editor of New Hampshire Watchdog, said the move by RGGI has little to do with lowering carbon emissions. He said the economic collapse and slow recovery meant fewer people purchased power from coal-burning plants. The fewer emissions meant fewer producers purchasing permits, which meant a loss of projected revenue for the nine states. This lost revenue, he said, is why RGGI wants to reduce the emissions cap.\""This has everything to do with revenues and nothing to do with the environment,"" Bosse said. ""This is driven by a desire for more state revenue.""\Higher electricity bills\If the recommendations are implemented, the average electricity bill should increase by less than 1 percent because of the reduced cap, RGGI said. Another $2.2 billion should be made available for investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy.\Such investments create jobs, save consumer money and enhance energy security, RGGI said.\Lewandowski said ratepayers will have to pay more to sustain the failed program.\""It just doesn't make sense,"" he said.\Two New Hampshire residents are on the RGGI board, PUC Chairman Robert Scott and Environmental Services Commissioner Thomas Burack. Fitzgerald said they endorsed the package of recommendations.\The proposed improvements package also calls for:\[bullet] A Cost Containment Reserve, which allows for additional allowances if sale prices exceed certain levels.\[bullet] A forestry protocol, which governs the use of forestry offsets for emission allowances.\[bullet] A prohibition on re-offering unsold 2012 and 2013 allowances.\[bullet] A commitment to identify and evaluate tracking tools for emissions associated with electricity imported from outside the RGGI region.\mhayward@unionleader.com\[Caption]"

Sen. John Sununu has signed on as a lead sponsor to a bill that would require power plants to cut emissions of four pollutants that contribute to poor air quality, including carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Climate policy advocates heralded the move as a significant step for Sununu, who until now has voted against legislation addressing climate change. But they also said his bill doesn't go far enough.
\
The bill, which is called the Clean Air Planning Act of 2007 and includes Sen. Judd Gregg as a co-sponsor, calls for emissions to be capped at today's levels by 2012 and annually reduced to achieve levels in 2050 that are 25 percent lower than emissions were in 1990.
\
Power plants would either cut their own emissions or buy carbon allowances on the open market from emitters in other sectors of the economy, according to a summary from lead Democratic sponsor Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware. Coal power plants that use cleaner fuel than the standard coal, such as goal gasification technology, would receive bonus allowances to sell.
\
The bill would also cut sulfur dioxide 82 percent and nitrogen oxide 68 percent by 2015. Those compounds contribute to acid rain and ozone pollution. Mercury, a neurotoxin that affects children and developing fetuses, would be cut 90 percent by 2015.
\
Carper introduced a similar bill last year, with help from Gregg and others. It stalled in committee.
\
In a statement, Sununu said the bill is a good one because the credits create incentives for the most efficient producers and deal with pollutants that drift from Midwest producers to contaminate New Hampshire air.
\
""If Congress takes action on these issues this year, I am committed to ensuring that any new regulations are fair, as efficient as possible, and have honest assessments of both costs and benefits,"" he said.
\
On carbon dioxide, climate advocates often point to the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act sponsored by Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Barbara Boxer of California as the ""gold standard."" It calls for an 80 percent reduction from all major emissions sources, including power plants, manufacturing and transportation, by 2050.
\
Environment New Hampshire advocate Erika Staaf said that's the standard necessary to slow projected warming.
\
""I want to think that (Sununu) wants to do the right thing on global warming,"" Staaf said. ""I think what we really need to do is convince him that people here in New Hampshire do support strong action.""
\
""Clean-coal"" technologies have been criticized by some environmentalists as transferring pollutants from one waste stream to another, not eliminating them.
\
""We should be investing in clean energy, not trying to purify dirty energy,"" said Jan Pendlebury, director of the New Hampshire chapter of the National Environmental Trust. ""There are many factors why we don't think this bill will go the distance, and that's one of them.""
\
But Pendlebury praised Sununu's ""dramatic"" progress on climate change. During the 2002 election, Pendlebury helped to pressure him on the whether he believed in the link between human-caused emissions and climate change. As Sununu began to publicly acknowledge that link, ""the challenge was to get him to find the right piece of legislation to act on,"" she said.
\
Sununu voted down a 2003 cap-and-trade plan and an amendment to the 2005 energy bill that would have expressed the Senate's desire for the United States to take action on climate change. Gregg supported both measures.
\
Pendlebury took Sununu's announcement last week to mean that he is ""thoroughly convinced"" of the need to take action on carbon emissions. Now, she said, climate skeptics in the Senate ""don't have a champion to hide behind.""
\
Two weeks ago, Sununu told the Monitor that he was looking carefully at legislation and that senators must be honest about the cost of regulation. He said multisector regulations would be ""a more fair approach."" The Clean Air Planning Act deals with emissions from electricity generators only, though Carper has billed his plan as one that could be folded into a broader one.
\
Sununu's name was not included on a Carper press release announcing the reintroduction of the bill released Thursday. Sununu spokeswoman Barbara Riley said that Sununu has been talking with Carper since January and that Carper delayed the introduction of the bill in the Senate until Friday to ensure he had Sununu's support.
\
This year, 158 towns passed resolutions at town meeting calling for federal action on climate change. Ted Leach, Republican co- chairman of the Carbon Coalition, the group that led that effort, said Sununu's bill is a start.
\
He said he thinks legislators are rushing ""to get on the high ground"" on this issue, now that Congress has a Democratic majority.
\
""You can sign on to anything you want,"" Leach said. ""But you've got to get out there and advocate for it. That's where the test is going to come.""
\
Leach said he would like to see Sununu amend the bill to be stricter.
\
Mary-Jo Boisvert, spokeswoman for Public Service of New Hampshire, whose coal-fired power plant in Bow is the state's largest source of mercury, said Sununu's bill would ""broaden the playing field a bit"" by imposing national mercury regulations. But she said the bill requirements may be less strict than regulations passed by the Legislature a year ago requiring PSNH to reduce its mercury emissions by at least 80 percent by 2013.
\
That bill gave PSNH incentives to do more. Because mercury accumulates in the local ecosystem, she said, the sooner the reductions, the better.

At a debate last month in Iowa, Jon Huntsman raised his hand. Along with the other Republican presidential candidates on stage, he indicated he was so opposed to raising taxes that he wouldn't accept a deficit-reduction deal even if it contained $10 in spending cuts for every $1 in new taxes.
\
But the former Utah governor and ambassador to China told the Monitor's editorial board last week that the federal budget is too complex an issue to be reduced to a show of hands.
\
""It was a nonsense question. You're never going to get a 10-to-1 deal on the table, so why even answer a hypothetical?"" Huntsman said. ""In the meantime, I wanted to stand my ground - broadly speaking - about my desire not to see taxes increased. . . . Raising your hand? Give me a break. A discussion that ought to take two hours as opposed to raising a hand? That's trivializing politics in a way that I think is unfortunate.""
\
Still, he didn't rule out supporting a budget deal that would contain new revenue.
\
""I've been a governor, and you're hired to make the machine work. You're hired to get the work of the state done. You're hired to move the agenda forward, and as the president of the United States, I would do the same thing,"" he said.
\
It's not the first time Huntsman, 51, has emphasized the need for pragmatism over no-compromise tactics. He supported the deal this summer to raise the debt ceiling and has described his tax-reform plan as a starting point for negotiations. Wrapping up a six-day swing through New Hampshire yesterday and with another televised debate tomorrow, Huntsman is showcasing a measured style as he looks to stand out in a crowded field.
\
Huntsman unveiled his jobs plan last week in Hudson, pledging to increase domestic use of natural gas, broker new free-trade agreements and roll back Bush- and Obama-era regulatory programs in order to spark economic growth.
\
The spearhead of the plan is a dramatic reform of the tax code by reducing the number of income-tax brackets, lowering rates, and eliminating all deductions and credits. The capital gains and dividend taxes would be eliminated, along with the alternative minimum tax. Corporate taxes would be reduced.
\
""I think it has to speak to competitiveness. I think it has to speak to the attraction of capital. I think it has to speak to the power of entrepreneurship and our creative class in this country,"" Huntsman said. ""And if our creative class is not willing to deploy capital into the marketplace or take a risk or do the things that have always fueled our economy in years past, then there's something wrong with the system.""
\
A three-time ambassador - to China, to Singapore and as deputy U.S. trade representative - Huntsman said his proposed reforms are meant to ensure the United States can remain competitive with other nations.
\
""I think we have an opportunity to win back investment. I think we have an opportunity to win back manufacturing in the years to come,"" he said. ""But that will be dependent on how well we prepare the marketplace for the realities of tomorrow: tax reform, regulatory reform, our schools and our universities. We're never going to be the cheapest, but we can be the best in terms of our standards and our practices.""
\
On health care, Huntsman favors repeal of President Obama's health care law. The New York Times reported Sunday that Huntsman, as governor, expressed support for an individual mandate before abandoning the idea. He said last week that he doesn't support such a measure and that it could be unconstitutional.
\
Instead, Huntsman said, he favors policies like those implemented in Utah while he was governor: promoting wellness, giving patients more information about their options, ""harmonizing"" records, and making available a stripped-down and affordable policy for the uninsured.
\
As governor, Huntsman signed on to a regional cap-and-trade system for western states and Canadian provinces. Last week, he said while he trusts scientists who say climate change is real, the U.S. can't ""unilaterally disarm"" if major polluters like China don't also take steps to fight global warming.
\
And, he said, the argument for immediate action ""is counterbalanced by the economic realities. We need jobs. We need a viable economy. We can't do something in today's environment that is going to create a shipwrecked nation in terms of our ability to compete and provide jobs for the people.""
\
Huntsman repeated his position that he accepted Obama's 2009 offer to become the U.S. ambassador in Beijing in order to serve his country. While Obama is ""a good man,"" Huntsman said, they mostly didn't work directly together.
\
""My lane was right in the U.S.-China relationship, right in the center of the activity there,"" he said. ""And if you look for 40 years, back to when this relationship was established . . . it's always been a relationship that has not given way to partisanship. It's always been a bipartisan relationship, because our interests in China are bipartisan.""

52,"New Hampshire Union Leader\MANCHESTER -- With Democratic efforts to push health-care bills through Congress likely scuttled by Massachusetts' election of Scott Brown to the U.S. Senate, New Hampshire 1st District U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter yesterday said that elements of the legislation may be broken out and acted on separately.\Shea-Porter made her remarks during a town-hall-style meeting in the Manchester City Library, and followed that with another public meeting in Epping.\Today she heads to Conway for a 3 p.m. meeting at the A. Crosby Kennett Middle School.\Though hostile at times, the environment in Manchester yesterday was not as raucous as the atmosphere surrounding a Shea-Porter forum devoted solely to health-care reform last August in the Norris Cotton Federal Building.\While some among the about 175 in attendance at times tried to talk over the two-term congresswoman, others held signs saying ""Show respect."" Tensions in the audience occasionally flared.\Although the forum was not dedicated to health-care reform, many of the questions were about the issue. Noting that Brown's election last week to the Senate seat previously occupied by Democrat Ted Kennedy gives the GOP the power to block reforms sought by the White House, Shea-Porter said, ""It's been an interesting turn of events for health care.""\After saying that elements of the proposed legislation may be acted on separately, Shea-Porter asked the more than 175 people attending the event to indicate if they were in favor of 10 key components.\Among those components:\* a requirement that insurance companies cover pre-existing conditions;\* a prohibition on lifetime cost limits;\* an emphasis on preventive care; improved access for women;\* an extension on family coverage to include members up to 27 years old;\* the creation of insurance pools for small businesses;\* the elimination of geographic payment disparity;\* and closing the ""doughnut hole"" for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans.\While many attending the meeting favored the components, some shouted that the bill should be killed, and others hollered, ""No to Obama-care.""\Shea-Porter said she opposes the Senate version of health-care legislation currently before Congress because it fails to close the doughnut hole and includes an excise tax, which she called a tax on the middle class. As she spoke, several attendees repeatedly interrupted her, most vociferously when she blamed the Bush administration for the country's economic and financial problems.\After the meeting, Jim Roblee of Bedford said he wanted to know if Shea-Porter supported the types of reforms called for by President Barack Obama, which, he said, would be a ""budget buster for New Hampshire"" because they would increase Medicaid costs.\""Is she representing New Hampshire's interest or Obama and his liberal agenda?"" Roblee asked.\During the meeting, Ralph Crane of Derry took issue with the federal government as a whole. ""Democrat, Republican, independent or demotarian or republitarian, it's not working,"" he said.\Crane criticized Washington politicians for being unwilling or unable to compromise, and asked Shea-Porter to do what her constituents tell her is best on issues such as health-care and cap-and-trade emissions-reduction bills. ""Let's use our heads; let's use some common sense,"" he said.\Shea-Porter said she couldn't agree more. She said being in Washington is like ""being with a dysfunctional family at Thanksgiving every day of the week.""\She also acknowledged voting for what the President wants 90 percent of the time and with her own party in the House 93 percent of the time. ""This is what I believe in,"" she said.\The national debt, the economy and jobs also were hot topics yesterday.\Shea-Porter supported establishing a bipartisan commission to develop recommendations on reducing the federal deficit. The bill, sponsored by New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg, ""puts everything on the table,"" and ""is the most honest way to do it right now,"" she said.\When she said that the Bush administration had entered office with a surplus but left with the federal deficit doubled, voices shouted over her. Shea-Porter acknowledged that Democrats ""have driven (the deficit) up too,"" but also blamed a tax structure in which, she said, the top 1 percent in personal income have not paid their fair share.\""You've been paying more than your fair share. It's been 'go after the middle class,'"" she said. ""Everybody benefits tremendously from the services in this great country. We all need a strong military and to take care of the old, and educate the young, and to do that, everyone needs to pay their fair share.""\But Jim Westgate of Manchester noted Democrats have controlled Congress since 2006. ""Congress, not the President spends our money,"" he said.\Westgate said people voted for hope and change in November 2008, but ""Obama's promises to us are lies. ... I want you off my property, out of my home, and your hand out of my pocket.""\Shea-Porter said change may not come as quickly as some would like, but, she said, a great deal has been accomplished in the last year.\""I do believe both sides of the aisle -- Democrats and Republicans -- are trying to make changes,"" she said. ""I know it's not easy, particularly if you don't have a job, you don't have health care or you can't pay your mortgage.""\Shea-Porter also held a town hall meeting in Epping yesterday and will have another in Conway today at 3 p.m. in the A. Crosby Kennett Middle School."

Speed boaters on Lake Winnipesaukee will likely have to slow down next summer. The Senate yesterday passed trial speed limits for the state's biggest lake in a 14-10 vote.
\
Boat speed limits have been debated for years. This bill differs from past plans in that it applies only to Lake Winnipesaukee and sunsets after two years, in 2011. The bill would limit speeds to 45 miles per hour during the day and 25 miles per hour at night.
\
The bill was hotly debated by the public, and senators continued that debate yesterday. Sen. Lou D'Allesandro, a Manchester Democrat, was perhaps the most excitable. He spoke against the bill. ""I always thought this was the 'Live Free or Die' state,"" D'Allesandro said. ""And here we are restricting every aspect of our lives.""
\
D'Allesandro also suggested the speed limits would, in fact, cause even more speeding - by what he called ""the boat police."" ""Who is going to arrest the boat police?"" D'Allesandro said. "" 'Cause they're going to have to speed to catch the speeders.""
\
Sen. Robert Letourneau, a Derry Republican, also opposed the bill. He said the possible speed limits have made boaters hesitant to put their boats in the water, which hurts lakeside businesses. Letourneau said he'd rather enforce existing boating laws.
\
But Sen. Peter Burling, a Cornish Democrat, said it's important to consider those who say fast boats are bad for the lake. He said lawmakers tried to strike a balance. ""It's 'Live Free or Die' for everybody, and that includes the family in the kayak,"" he said.
\
The bill now heads to Gov. John Lynch.
\
Charter schools
\
The Senate narrowly passed a bill that could rescue the state's seven most imperiled charter schools. In a 13-11 vote, senators supported giving the seven schools an additional $1 per student next year, a move that will likely lead the charter school funding bill to a committee of conference, where lawmakers could work out a compromise.
\
Charter school supporters advocated for a bill that would have directed $1.5 million to the seven schools, which rely on the state for nearly all of their funding. That bill passed the House but was rejected this week by the Senate Finance Committee. The committee amended the bill to give the schools an extra $1 per student to keep the issue alive.
\
Without more state funding, the seven schools will likely close, advocates said. All 12 state charter schools are slated to get $3,800 per student in state aid next year. The $1.5 million bill would have doled out an additional $2,700 to the seven schools most in need.
\
Sen. Ted Gatsas, a Manchester Republican who voted for the $1-per-student bill yesterday, said he thinks charter schools deserve a shot, especially in light of lawmakers' recent push for new paths to graduation. ""This certainly is alternative education,"" he said.
\
Advocates were cautiously pleased with yesterday's vote, given the tally.
\
""This is the step we need at this point,"" said Bill Wilmot of the Seacoast Charter School.
\
""I'm happy we have a few more weeks to convince them,"" said John Davis of the Surry Village Charter School.
\
RGGI
\
The Senate also endorsed a 10-state plan to curb climate change yesterday.
\
The Senate voted 16-8 to implement the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, known as RGGI, but to revisit the initiative if Congress enacts a federal program. The House next considers changes made to the proposal, especially on how much money would go into a fund to promote energy efficiency.
\
Gov. John Lynch believes the initiative will help New Hampshire's environment and economy.
\
The bill adds New Hampshire to the other New England states, New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland in a market-based, ""cap and trade"" program to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the region's power plants.
\
The governors of the 10 states have signed a memorandum of understanding agreeing to the initiative. It is a regional plan, but each state must adopt its own laws and regulations. States in other regions are considering similar plans.
\
Under RGGI, a regional carbon dioxide emissions cap would be put in place for large, fossil-fuel-fired power plants beginning in 2009. Allowances would be issued equal to the total cap and apportioned to the participating states. Utilities would have to buy enough allowances within three years to cover their emissions. Since the number of allowances is limited by the regional cap, overall emissions are expected to be reduced.
\
Death penalty study
\
The Senate turned down a bill that would have created a commission to study a possible expansion of the state's death penalty law. Senators said it would be inappropriate to study the law in the midst of two pending death penalty cases.
\
Michael Addison is charged with capital murder in connection with the shooting of a Manchester police officer. John Brooks is charged with hiring men to kill another man.
\
Poker tax
\
The Senate rejected allowing video lottery machines at the state's four race tracks, but voted to tax poker games.
\
The Senate voted 13-11 yesterday against allowing video lottery at tracks in Salem, Seabrook, Belmont and Hinsdale.
\
D'Allesandro - the bill's sponsor - argued the state needs the millions of dollars gambling would provide for state programs and services. But Portsmouth Democrat Martha Fuller Clark countered that expanded gaming would hurt New Hampshire's quality of life.
\
The Senate voted 16-8 to tax Texas Hold 'em and other poker games now being run by charities. Hudson Republican Bob Clegg said lawmakers should allow video lottery instead of taxing games run for charities.
\
Supporters of the bill pointed out that the state already gets a share of wagers on Bingo and Lucky Seven.

President Obama's move to limit U.S. carbon emissions may prompt an important shift by China in its climate policies, where officials are increasingly worried about the costs of pollution anyway, according to a Chinese expert and activists closely following the international negotiations.
\
The initiative may be a crucial move in pressuring Beijing to accept binding goals to cut greenhouse gases, while also allowing the U.S. to start catching up with the European Union in the fight against climate change.
\
""This is the kind of leadership that's highly needed,"" said Martin Kaiser, head of international climate politics at Greenpeace. The proposal should have been twice as ambitious, he added, but ""it demonstrates that the Obama administration wants to seriously tackle climate change.""
\
The plan, unveiled Monday, would reduce carbon dioxide emissions from U.S. power plants, many of which are coal-fired, by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.
\
Governments want an agreement by late next year in Paris to curb emissions of greenhouse gasses blamed for global warming. Unlike the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which exempted developing nations from emissions limits, this deal is supposed to cover every country.
\
The United States never ratified the Kyoto protocol, handing China and others an easy excuse to dodge tougher action as well.
\
""The new initiative is a first firm commitment that puts the U.S. in a serious negotiating position for the upcoming climate talks in Paris,"" said Georg Zachmann, an expert with the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel.
\
""It gives hope that further steps in that direction will be forthcoming,"" he added.
\
The U.S. announcement came just ahead of international climate talks starting today in Bonn, Germany, where governments will discuss how ambitious to be in tackling global warming over the coming decades. Climate change is also on the agenda at a meeting of the G-7 leaders in Brussels tomorrow, bringing together Obama and his counterparts from the other leading Western economies.
\
China, the world's biggest polluter ahead of the U.S., has promised to curb its output but has so far resisted binding limits. The U.S. move will give incentive to the Chinese to do more, many experts believe.
\
""Obama's plan to cut greenhouse gas may have some impact on China's decision-making,"" said Wang Ke, a professor at the School of Environment and Natural Resources at People's University in Beijing. ""But China's goal will be based on its domestic needs in the transformation of its economy and handling smog.""
\
United Nations climate chief Christiana Figueres on Saturday insisted she fully expected ""action by the United States to spur others in taking concrete action.""
\
Greenpeace's Kaiser sounded an optimistic note on China, saying that witnessing high pollution in their own cities had convinced leaders in Beijing that only joint action could tackle the problem. ""Both countries, the U.S. and China, have seen the consequences of climate change at home and realize now that only joint international action with binding targets can be a solution,"" he added.
\
Like many developing countries, China's status has changed drastically since the 1997 agreement. It has grown into an export powerhouse and the world's second-largest economy, prompting American lawmakers to say any new treaty must cover China. Beijing says it is still too poor to take on the limits imposed on rich countries.
\
Clare Perry, a campaigner for the London-based Environmental Investigation Agency, said Obama's plan falls way short of what is needed to stop global warming, but it ""should help bring China to the table.""
\
China accounted for 29 percent of global carbon emissions in 2012, more than the U.S. and the 28-nation European Union combined, according to the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.
\
Europe welcomed Obama's plan, if more for the political dynamic than for its ambition.
\
Obama has pledged a reduction of 17 percent of the entire economy's emissions by 2020 compared with the level in 2005, even though that isn't an internationally binding target. It compares to a reduction of about 4 percent in relation to 1990 levels.
\
EU officials in Brussels estimate Obama's new plan will only reduce U.S. emissions sufficiently to meet the overall target of a 17 percent reduction by 2020. Without the new plan, the reduction would come in at only about 12 percent.
\
The EU, in turn, has already reduced its emissions by 19 percent compared with 1990 and aims to achieve a reduction of about 25 percent by 2020, and 40 percent by 2030.
\
Its successful emissions reduction, however, got a boost from the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe in 1990, which led to the closure of many polluting plants. Activists complain the EU has lost steam in its fight against climate change in the past years since the global financial crisis hit the continent 2008.
\
Still, one of the EU's most prominent tools in the fight against climate change is a comprehensive emissions trading system, under which companies pay per ton of carbon dioxide they release into the atmosphere, with the pollution certificates traded on the market.
\
In the U.S., Obama's efforts to pass a cap-and-trade bill failed on Capitol Hill due to bipartisan opposition.
\
Bruegel's Zachmann also warned that Obama's new initiative relies on executive action and bypasses Congress, which could make it far easier for his successor to change the rules again.
\
""If everything can be reversed following a change of leadership, that's bad because it might not create the necessary legal certainty for businesses to invest in low-carbon technology,"" he said.
\
Scientists, however, maintain that far larger cuts will be required to avoid drastic environmental change.
\
Emissions must drop by 40-70 percent by 2050 to keep the global temperature rise below the 2-degree C (3.6-degree F) cap set in U.N. climate talks, according to a report in April by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Scientists consider it a key threshold above which the impact of global warming on humans would increase significantly, for example through extreme weather conditions.
\
Instead, emissions are rising. The IPCC said that global emissions increased by 2.2 percent a year between 2000 and 2010, outpacing growth in previous decades to reach ""unprecedented levels,"" underlining the urgency to reach a global climate deal next year in Paris.

55,"
State Sen. Jim Rausch of Derry announced he won't seek re-election yesterday, making him the third Republican senator who plans to vacate his seat alongside Sens. Bob Odell of New London and Peter Bragdon of Milford.
\
Even during times of intense polarization at the State House, all three have shown a willingness to work across the aisle on at least a few major issues, leading to bipartisan plans to increase the state's gas tax to pay for road and bridge repairs, expand Medicaid and join 10 other states in a plan to reduce carbon emissions. But it's these very types of initiatives that have led conservatives, including the Republican Liberty Caucus, to threaten primaries against incumbent Senate Republicans. With the retirement of just these three senators, the New Hampshire Senate could look very different next year.
\
""A big question is who emerges as the Republican candidates in those districts, and will they be in a similar cast to those three or will they be more partisan,"" said Dante Scala, associate professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire.
\
Conservative challengers emerged in both Odell's and Rausch's districts even before the two announced their retirement plans, but both point to family as their reasons for retiring. Both have been in the Legislature for 14 years, with Rausch spending four in the Senate and Odell 12. Bragdon is retiring to continue his work as executive director of HealthTrust, a job that caused him to step down as Senate president and prompted an ethics investigation last fall. He will leave the Legislature on June 6. No Senate Democrats have yet announced plans to retire, but more announcements are likely. About one-third of the Senate turns over each year.
\
New Hampshire Republican Party Vice Chairman JP Marzullo will take on former New Hampshire Banking Association president Jerry Little in a primary to replace Odell, while state Rep. Linda Tanner of Georges Mills is the Democrat seeking his seat. State Reps. Regina Birdsell of Hampstead and Frank Sapareto of Derry, as well as Jim Foley, chairman of the Derry Republican Committee, will face off for Rausch's seat. For Bragdon's seat, Rep. Gary Daniels of Milford and Merrimack town Councilor Dan Dwyer, who lost to Bragdon in a 2012 primary, both told WMUR they will run.
\
Democrats are feeling confident about their chances of picking up seats.
\
""We have motivated, strong candidates on the ballot, and the (Democratic Party) will be working doggedly to give our candidates the support they need to connect with families across the state who are sick of far-right representatives who work more for the special interests than for our communities,"" party Chairman Ray Buckley said in a statement. ""With these Republicans leaving the Senate, and the far right primaries that are shaping up, it is clear the Tea Party faction of the (Republican Party) is flexing its muscle.""
\
But Bragdon noted that all three districts have a moderate edge, which he said makes it likely Republicans elected to run for those seats will bring a similar approach to their predecessors.
\
Odell's seat
\
Based on the numbers, Democrats have the best shot at picking up Odell's seat. His district, which covers 24 towns including Antrim, Hillsborough, New London, Newbury and Weare, voted for Democrat Maggie Hassan by a wide margin in the 2012 election and President Obama by a smaller one. Odell has built a reputation as one of the Senate's most bipartisan Republicans. He worked on a Medicaid expansion plan that uses the federal dollars to expand access to private health care for 50,000 individuals, supported the gas tax increase and was one of two Republicans to vote for repealing the death penalty after a memorable speech on the Senate floor.
\
Rausch's seat
\
Rausch's district, which covers Derry, Hampstead and Windham, is solidly Republican. One of Rausch's biggest legacies will be his effort to increase the gas tax by 4 cents, the first increase since 1991. His effort took serious heat from Republican groups, and just four other Republicans, including Bragdon and Odell, supported the bill. Rausch also said his work with Republican Sen. Nancy Stiles to revamp the state's education funding formula is one of his proudest accomplishments. He also joined six other Republicans to vote for Medicaid expansion. After spending 10 years in the House, Rausch said the Senate has a more collegial environment.
\
""I am a Republican. I believe in Republican principles, but through all that, we have to solve problems,"" Rausch said.
\
Bragdon's seat
\
Bragdon controlled the Senate during Bill O'Brien's reign as speaker of the House, and the Senate often handled issues with a more pragmatic approach than the lower chamber. In 2008, Bragdon co-sponsored legislation bringing New Hampshire into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade type agreement with 10 other states aimed at reducing carbon emissions by power plants. Bragdon voted this year for the gas tax increase, but largely because he was able to secure an elimination of tolls in Merrimack as part of the deal. He recused himself on the Medicaid expansion vote, citing a conflict of interest with his work at HealthTrust. Bragdon said he believes its possible to work across the aisle without giving up on ""underlying core principles.""
\
""I do think my approach is to sit down with people and talk about stuff and see if you can come to a meeting of the minds,"" he said. You ""treat each other with respect, and that comes in handy the next time you want to deal with an issue.""
\
His district, made up of Amherst, Merrimack, Milford and Wilton, voted for Hassan in the 2012 governor's race, but for Republican Mitt Romney in the presidential.
\
For all of the three seats, vigorous primaries are expected.
\
The Republican Liberty Caucus plans to hold steady on its promise to find ""liberty-minded"" candidates to challenge every senator, Republicans and Democrats, who voted for Medicaid expansion, Chairman Aaron Day said. As of now, they've recruited 20 candidates.
\
All candidates for statewide office must file to run between June 4-13. Voters will have until the Sept. 9 primary to decide whose approach they like best.

56,"
The $457 million that it will cost to clean up emissions from Public Service of New Hampshire's coal power plant in Bow is a lot of money. But could the project cost ratepayers even more? That's the question that parties challenging the project before the Public Utilities Commission are asking.
\
The Legislature in 2006 mandated that PSNH add a scrubber to the plant to cut emissions of mercury, a neurotoxin. The scrubber, which would also nearly eliminate sulfur dioxide, a factor in acid rain and asthma, was estimated then to cost about $250 million. That jumped 83 percent.
\
Even with the increase, PSNH maintains that its electricity will remain among the cheapest in the Northeast. But some who question the scrubber say it would effectively extend the life of a 40-year-old plant at a time when the economic benefits of burning coal are uncertain and the environmental detriment is clear.
\
Gary Hirshberg, founder and CEO of organic yogurt producer Stonyfield Farm, is leading a group of businesses appealing to the commission to review whether the scrubber is in the state's interest. The commission had previously ruled that it didn't have authority to review the project. It has suspended that decision while it considers the companies' appeals.
\
Hirshberg thinks the cost of keeping the plant going could rise to more than $1 billion, and he's not alone. Others say PSNH could see the cost of operations rise as it's required to comply with possible federal regulations on carbon emissions, stricter federal mercury controls and other air and water regulations. Hirshberg wants the state to think about how else that money could be used.
\
""The problem is that the $457 million, when you dig into it, it's absolutely not the number,"" he said. ""It's just a question of how much more.""
\
State Consumer Advocate Meredith Hatfield said New Hampshire has a history of making the wrong assumptions about electricity costs, pointing to the construction of Seabrook Station and inflated 20-year contracts with wood power plants. She said it is the state's job to dig into PSNH's analysis when the company says ""trust us.""
\
""We have just enough information to cause us to want to ask more questions about what is the right investment to make on behalf of PSNH ratepayers,"" Hatfield said.
\
PSNH emits about 3.7 million tons of carbon yearly. The company applied last month for a rate increase of about 10 percent, to 10.51 cents per kilowatt hour. A portion of that increase is attributed to compliance with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 10-state plan to cut carbon emissions.
\
The program requires generators to purchase an allowance, available through a regional auction, for every ton of carbon emitted. The revenue from New Hampshire generators will be used to support energy efficiency programs.
\
The company has estimated that it would spend about $15.4 million buying allowances in the first year.
\
Given the progress of climate-related bills in Congress and the focus President-elect Barack Obama has given to the issue, it seems probable that a federal program for cutting carbon emissions could be in place soon.
\
Ken Colburn, former state air resources director who now runs the consulting firm Symbiotic Strategies, said a federal program would likely be more stringent than the regional one, which he called a ""gentle"" first step.
\
Allowances for the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative sold in the first auction this fall for $3.07 each. In a federal program, carbon emissions could cost generators between $15 and $45 per ton, according to a July study by Synapse Energy Economics. At the mid-range price of $30, that could mean an added $111 million in carbon costs each year.
\
Colburn said he thinks that PSNH has done a good job of being proactive on environmental issues facing the state and that it's important to remove mercury from the atmosphere. But, he said, it is valid to question the logic of investing in the coal plant.
\
""Should we still be doing the same old things as we approach a brand new world?"" Colburn said. ""I think that's a fair question.""
\
Martin Murray, PSNH spokesman, said the plant can only address regulations as they are created, not engage in a ""guessing game.""
\
""Something might happen? It might cost more? Sure, I suppose that could happen,"" Murray said. ""We, as a regulated utility, have to abide by the regulations that are imposed on us, and that's what we're doing.""
\
Value added
\
The company stands to gain a lot from the construction of the scrubber. PSNH's rate of return is calculated as a percentage based on the value of the generation facility, which is now about $73 million. The scrubber would increase the value of the plant more than seven-fold. Murray said profits would increase proportionately.
\
Ratepayers pay for improvements at the plant through the energy service charge on their bill. But, Murray said, they would benefit from the scrubber, too. He said they would have cleaner power and maintain low rates compared with other utilities.
\
PSNH has proposed that the energy service charge should be 10.51 cents starting in January. That's compared to 11.2 cents in the same month for Unitil and 11.1 cents for National Grid.
\
The scrubber wouldn't factor into rates until 2012 or 2013. The company has said it would add 0.5 cents to the cost of one kilowatt hour in the first year and 0.31 cents per kilowatt hour averaged over 15 years. Residential customers who use 500 kilowatt hours per month could see their monthly bill go up $2.50 in the first year and $1.55 a year averaged over 15 years.
\
Hirshberg and others want to review that analysis and to consider other factors.
\
For example, PSNH could be required by the Environmental Protection Agency to upgrade its cooling system. The company takes in an average of 144 million gallons of water from the Merrimack River per day to cool the plant and discharges it into the river at temperatures of up to 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to David Webster, chief of industrial permits for the New England EPA office.
\
The permit that allows that practice expired in 1997, though the conditions have been ""administratively continued"" ever since. The EPA is reviewing a renewal application now.
\
Webster said his office is studying what happens to eggs, larvae and fish sucked into the system and the ecological impacts of the warm water discharged in the river. It could require the plant to modify the system or to change it altogether, he said.
\
More modern plants use closed-cycle cooling systems that reuse the water, cooling it in towers, which cuts the daily water intake by about 95 percent. Webster said, according to PSNH's filings, such a system could cost about $68 million to build at the Bow plant and $6.5 million annually to operate.
\
Murray said that issue is in the hands of the EPA.
\
Another possibility is that the federal government would put in place a mercury law that's more stringent than New Hampshire's. That issue is in limbo now. The Supreme Court in February shot down the EPA's plan to create a cap-and-trade program for mercury because mercury is considered a local issue and such a program would essentially allow emitters to trade pollution in one area for emission cuts in another.
\
State Air Resources Director Bob Scott said he thinks the scrubber at the Bow plant will cut more than the state requires and will likely get enough mercury out of the smokestack to satisfy any federal law. If not, he said, PSNH could add another technology that has been tested there, called an activated carbon injection system, for a ""minimal cost.""
\
Jonathan Peress, a Lebanon attorney who works on power plant issues and is representing a PSNH competitor before the Public Utilities Commission in a separate case, does not think the plant would be able to comply. Peress said scrubbers alone don't often go far enough in cleaning up mercury. Many plants use both the scrubber and the injection system. And, he said, the age of the Bow plant, built in 1968, makes upgrades tricky.
\
Joel Harrington, who helped craft the mercury law when he worked for the New Hampshire Audubon Society, said the scrubber must be built and the state must take a deeper look at its energy future.
\
""It's not one or the other,"" he said. ""It really is both.""
\
Harrington, who now works for The Nature Conservancy, said it is important to get mercury and sulfur out of the atmosphere as quickly as possible, because both have immediate impacts on the environment. He said he also wants to see a group convened - people from PSNH, the New England power grid, merchant companies and energy experts - to come up with solutions for changing the state's energy mix.
\
""I think we need to answer a lot of questions about our energy future before we can get to a point where the investment in a scrubber unit doesn't make sense,"" he said.
\
Sen. Ted Gatsas, a Manchester Republican, has been a vocal opponent of slowing down the scrubber construction. He said the plant is an important asset to the town of Bow. He worries, should the plant be shut down, that taxes there would go up and rates would increase for PSNH customers across the state.
\
""The law is very clear,"" he said. ""It says they shall do it. We either write laws for them to be followed or we don't. And, if we delay the process, the cost is going to be up.""

57,"
Are there hard feelings between President Obama and Republican Sen. Judd Gregg? Publicly, Obama isn't saying so.
\
A year ago, Obama nominated Gregg as commerce secretary. Gregg accepted, then withdrew his name from consideration. Since then, Gregg has been a vocal critic of any presidential policies that would increase the deficit.
\
At Obama's town hall event in Gregg's hometown of Nashua last week, Hampton resident Garry Meyer asked whether the president would be willing to meet one-on-one with Gregg to pass health care reform and environmental legislation.
\
Obama responded, ""I'm willing to meet with anybody, including Sen. Gregg, who I offered a job to. . . . I like Sen. Gregg. I think he is a . . . serious person.""
\
Obama also gave credit to Gregg for developing the idea for a bipartisan fiscal commission. Gregg sponsored legislation to create the commission with Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota. Obama supported the idea but the Senate rejected it.
\
The praise didn't tone down Gregg's criticism of the president's proposal to use $30 billion of repaid TARP money for a small-business loan fund. Gregg, who helped develop TARP, advocates using the money to pay down the national debt. ""TARP is not a piggybank,"" Gregg said. ""TARP worked as intended during the financial crisis, but the crisis has passed, and the program is no longer needed. . . . TARP dollars should not be used as a slush fund for the president's other priorities.""
\
Meyer, a registered Democrat and former Republican, said he asked the question because he believes Obama and Gregg are both intelligent and should be able to work together to solve problems.
\
""I believe (Gregg's) interested in helping improve health care in New Hampshire, and I also believe the same thing's true of President Obama,"" Meyer said. ""Yet at least to date, Senator Gregg hasn't been able to vote for either health care reform or the clean air act in the Senate, or been willing to help get them approved in the Senate.""
\
Obama on the environment
\
Local environmental advocates had reason to cheer for Obama.
\
In response to a question by former congressman Dick Swett, Obama stressed the need to invest in new energy technologies.
\
""You've got the whole clean energy sector, which is ready to take off if we provide the kind of seed capital, the kind of R&D credits that are necessary,"" Obama said. He asked people to improve energy efficiency, from using LED light bulbs to weatherizing homes. He also defended cap-and-trade. ""The concept of incentivizing clean energy so that it's the cheaper, more effective kind of energy is one that is proven to work,"" he said.
\
Jon Strimling, president of woodpellets.com, said the country uses energy for electricity, transportation fuels and heating. While the first two are often discussed, Obama also focused on heating and cooling - for example by retrofitting homes. ""It's good to see someone addressing all three now,"" Strimling said.
\
Catherine Corkery of the New Hampshire Sierra Club said Obama's emphasis on energy efficiency fits with Gov. John Lynch's plan for retrofitting homes. ""It's great that the president is in line and has tapped into that thinking,"" Corkery said.
\
Evan Carlson of Repower America added, ""It's good to finally see it at the forefront of the conversation.""
\
Peggo
\
Obama also gave a shout-out to 2nd District Rep. Paul Hodes's wife, Peggo Hodes. While talking about reinstating the ""PAYGO,"" or pay-as-you-go rule, in Congress, Obama added: ""That is not to be confused with Paul Hodes's wife Peggo . . . although I really like her, too.""
\
Taxes: the poem
\
House Finance Committee member Neal Kurk, a Weare Republican, testified before the House on Wednesday on a constitutional amendment prohibiting broad-based taxes. Here's a copy of his original poem. Er, his testimony.
\
Taxes
\
I hope that we shall always ax
\
a bill for sales or income tax.
\
A tax whose broad-based mouth will suck
\
the vigor from New Hampshire's pluck.
\
A tax that kills the jobs we seek
\
but builds the psyche of the chic.
\
A tax that Reds do castigate
\
and use to seal the Blues' sad fate.
\
This bill must die so Reds can reign,
\
their issue still - to make their gain.
\
Poor Blues! Their 'yea' supports their cause
\
but puts them square within Reds' jaws.
\
LLC reform
\
In a campaign mailer from the District 16 state Senate race, Rep. Jeff Goley says he will ""lead the fight to reform the LLC tax."" Here's the rub - Goley is a Democrat. The mailer was paid for by the state Democratic Party. Goley's fellow party members have been defending the extension of the interest and dividends tax to LLC owners. And Goley voted for the budget that included the tax.
\
He stopped short of advocating ""repeal,"" as Republicans have been pushing. But Goley said he was reconsidering the issue, since constituents have ""expressed questions and concerns about the closure of the LLC loophole"" since the budget bill was passed. ""There are a number of bipartisan improvements being discussed in both the House and the Senate that would address many of these issues,"" Goley said. ""I am looking closely at all of these proposals and have talked with legislative leaders about several possible solutions.""
\
Legislative steps
\
House Republicans scored a surprise victory this week, when the House voted 189-169 to restore $5 million from the rooms and meals tax to cities and towns. Where the money would come from to fill the state coffers is unknown, and the bill must still pass the Senate. The House rejected a bill that would have restored $25 million to cities and towns.
\
In the ""unsurprising"" category, the House voted to reject installing metal detectors at the State House, to repeal the law criminalizing adultery, and to send a bill legalizing marijuana for further study.
\
News or not?
\
John Edwards's affair, and the child he fathered with a mistress, is not news.
\
So said several of Edwards's earliest supporters in the 2008 New Hampshire presidential primary race. One disillusioned supporter said he didn't want to be associated with Edwards. Two others didn't appreciate the question.
\
""I'm disappointed the Monitor would even care and denigrate itself to act like Fox News,"" said Harry Judd. ""The guy's a private citizen. I'm very fond of Elizabeth and John. He who's without sin should cast the first stone.""
\
Joe Foster echoed, ""I'm sad for the children having to go through this circumstance that their parents' private life is being spread along the pages of papers. I'm saddened it's a newsworthy item.""
\
Since when did a former presidential candidate become ""non-newsworthy?""
\
One interesting twist came from the Center for Responsive Politics, which noted that Edwards was among the top five recipients of donations from women's rights groups during the 2008 election. Among the four who outraised Edwards: then-U.S. Senate candidate Jeanne Shaheen.
\
State Senate
\
The state Senate seat in District 2, held by Plymouth Democrat Deborah Reynolds, is spurring competition.
\
State Rep. Fran Wendelboe, a New Hampton Republican, is starting to campaign. On a glossy postcard adorned with an American flag, Wendelboe touts her A-plus NRA rating and fiscal conservatism. On a website, franforsenate.com, Wendelboe also talks about the need to simplify the health care system and says she supports legislation to define marriage as between a man and a woman.
\
Jeanie Forrester of Meredith plans to challenge Wendelboe for the Republican nomination. Forrester has been the executive director of Main Street programs in Meredith and Plymouth and is a former town administrator of Tuftonboro. She was a staff member for former governor John H. Sununu and former U.S. representative Bill Zeliff.
\
Pence is coming
\
Indiana Republican Congressman Mike Pence will speak at the Hillsborough County Republican Committee's 2010 Lincoln-Reagan Gala Reception and Dinner on March 19 at CR Sparks in Bedford. The No. 3 Republican in U.S. House leadership, Pence recently decided not to run for Senate. With trips to Iowa, South Carolina and now the Granite State, it looks like he has his eye on higher office in 2012.

Ten New Hampshire towns - Barnstead, Chesterfield, Exeter, Harrisville, Hollis, Marlborough, Nelson, Peterborough, Richmond and Swanzey - will vote on a petition warrant article at town meeting asking: ""Shall New Hampshire's congressional delegation be instructed to pursue a new and independent investigation to address thoroughly all of the evidence and unanswered questions related to the events of Sept. 11, 2001?""
\
According to the Vote for Answers campaign, petition signatories include Harrisville Rep. Peter Allen, a Democrat, and former Republican governor Walter Peterson.
\
""When I saw the TV film of 9/11, I immediately had the reaction it was demolition,"" Allen said, pointing to the horizontal explosions across the floors that then proceeded downward. ""Nothing's changed that in my mind.""
\

\
U.S. Senate candidate Kelly Ayotte aired her first radio campaign ad this week. In it, she touts her experience as attorney general, particularly in prosecuting the killer of Manchester police office Michael Briggs. She mentions her husband, Joe, an Iraq veteran, and portrays herself as a strong fiscal conservative. ""I'm running for Senate to stop bailouts and eliminate wasteful spending,"" she says.

"
58,"
Ask Jeff Bart, owner of the Granite State Candy Shoppe in Concord, about the chatter in the Legislature to make New Hampshire a friendlier place to do business, and he shrugs. ""I don't currently see the business climate . . . from a regulatory standpoint or a tax standpoint as anything onerous at all,"" said Bart, who is more worried about what state revenue cuts might mean for his property taxes.
\
That's not a view shared by Tim Sink, president of the Greater Concord Chamber of Commerce, who sees plenty of room for legislative action. Among his concerns: the tax burden on businesses, the predictability of the tax code, health care costs and paperwork required to comply with some government regulations.
\
Those are the issues that have resonated with members of the new Republican-dominated Legislature, many of whom were elected this fall on a platform of making New Hampshire more ""business friendly."" How lawmakers define that term in the months ahead won't be clear until they act on dozens of ideas for legislation, touching on everything from barbers to racetracks to tax policy.
\
Bill requests submitted by Republican lawmakers for the upcoming session generally focus on two areas, lowering taxes and decreasing government regulation - goals that have been echoed by House Speaker William O'Brien and Majority Leader D.J. Bettencourt.
\
Democrats assert that the state already has low taxes, and businesses benefit more from government investment in quality-of-life issues, such as education and public safety. But they will be vastly outnumbered in the House and Senate by Republicans who are promising aggressive action to promote business growth.
\
According to analyses by the Tax Foundation, the American Legislative Exchange Council and the New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies, New Hampshire's business climate ranks high among the states because of its lack of an income, sales or estate tax. It has an educated workforce and a low unemployment rate. But New Hampshire ranks toward the bottom for its corporate tax rate, property tax burden and workers compensation costs. It also has high health care and energy costs.
\
Robert Tannenwald, an economist at the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, D.C., said it is impossible to measure New Hampshire's business climate based on one metric like the corporate tax rate.
\
""You expect New Hampshire to rely heavily on the business tax to avoid a broad-based income or sales tax,"" Tannenwald said. ""The state can't have its fiscal cake and eat it too.""
\
Over the last four years, when the Democrats held the majority in the Legislature, they and Democratic Gov. John Lynch implemented a program that allows workers to collect unemployment benefits while receiving on-the-job training, and that pays workers unemployment money if companies and workers agree on reduced hours instead of layoffs. They approved tax credits for research and development, expanded broadband technology, established a specialized business court and forced companies to warn employees of mass layoffs.
\
But at the same time, Democrats expanded the interest and dividends tax on limited liability companies and implemented a tax on campsites - both of which were repealed after an outcry from businesses. The Legislature also raised the meals and rooms tax, instituted a tax on gambling winnings, and raised fees.
\
""I watched us chase businesses out of New Hampshire for the past two years,"" said Rep. Frank Sapareto, a Derry Republican and financial planner who serves on the House Ways and Means Committee. ""It disgusted me.""
\
Repealing taxes
\
Among the ideas proposed by Republicans are bills that would repeal the tax on gambling winnings and reduce the rates of the tobacco tax, business profits tax, rooms and meals tax and interest and dividends tax for the elderly. Bills would establish or expand a variety of tax credits that businesses can take against the interest and dividends tax, the business enterprise tax, and the business profits tax.
\
A far-reaching list of policy priorities released last week by the Business and Industry Association includes opposing tax increases and supporting investment in public transportation.
\
Senate Majority Leader Jeb Bradley said he anticipates that the tax issues will be dealt with as part of the state budget rather than as stand-alone bills.
\
""We'd all like to see a rollback of some of the tax and fee hikes that occurred over the last four years,"" Bradley said.
\
Supporters of these bills say the taxes hurt business. For example, they say the gambling winnings tax resulted in the state selling fewer lottery tickets and attracting fewer gamblers. (State revenue reports show any gains from the gambling tax are more than offset by drops in lottery sales.)
\
David Juvet, senior vice president of the Business and Industry Association, has urged lawmakers to lower business tax rates. Juvet argues that lowering taxes will spur economic growth in the long term.
\
Sen. Ray White of Bedford, vice chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, hopes to change how businesses pay unemployment taxes and the business enterprise tax - both of which are based on payroll - because, he said, the taxes discourage businesses from hiring.
\
""Anything tied to business payroll is problematic,"" White said. ""You can be a profitable business with a small payroll that's not taxed, while another business that's not profitable but has a large payroll is punitively taxed.""
\
One other topic likely to be a priority is redefining the deduction for ""reasonable compensation"" that business owners can take from their business profits tax. Last session, the Legislature increased the threshold under which a business owner doesn't have to justify his compensation.
\
A bill sponsored by Bradley with the support of other House and Senate leaders would shift the burden of showing that a business owner's compensation is unreasonable to the Department of Revenue Administration.
\
Infrastructure questions
\
But cutting taxes means less revenue for the state, and potentially less money for roads and schools, which also play a role in attracting businesses.
\
Site Selection magazine, which focuses on real estate and economic development, found that the biggest factor for businesses in choosing a location is a skilled workforce, followed by transportation infrastructure, the permitting and regulatory structure, then state and local taxes.
\
Jeff McLynch, executive director for the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute in Concord, which examines how state policy influences low- and moderate-income people, worried that infrastructure would be hurt by tax cuts. ""If you're cutting business taxes, you obviously don't have money to invest in education, training, to keep up roads, keep up the court system in the way businesses rely on,"" McLynch said.
\
A Commission to Study New Hampshire Business Taxes, created last legislative session, released a draft report that recommends that New Hampshire keep its business taxes flat. The only solid recommendation from the committee, which will continue work for two years, is that the current insurance tax rate should not be changed. The report said a theme that emerged from testimony is that the business profits tax and business enterprise tax could not be raised without hurting businesses. But it did not recommend lowering either tax.
\
""The state needs some kind of a revenue,"" said Commission Chairman Joel Olbricht, president of an accounting firm in Hampstead. ""Whereas nobody wants to see it go up, they felt there was no competitive reason for the tax rates to go down.""
\
Examining regulations
\
Proposals to curb state regulations are even more diverse than bills addressing taxes.
\
Rep. Paul Mirski, an Enfield Republican, sponsored a bill that would establish a commission to study business regulations. ""I want to take a look at everything we can find on the regulatory environment, every aspect of industry or business and identify all those regulations that make it difficult to compete and to create jobs,"" Mirski said. ""I want to find out what's driving them out of the state.""
\
Other lawmakers were more specific about which regulations they hope to change. Rep. John Hunt of Rindge, chairman of the House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee, said his committee will discuss whether to repeal or change all the health insurance mandates passed the last four years, including mandates on insurers to cover early intervention autism treatment, bariatric surgery and hearing aids.
\
Weare Republican Rep. Neal Kurk sponsored a bill to repeal the authority of the state to license and regulate certain professions. Kurk said those professions include barbering, cosmetology, esthetics, landscape architecture, court reporting, athletic training, recreational therapy and family mediation.
\
""Regulating these occupations costs money. The requirements for education and for follow-up training are very expensive,"" Kurk said. ""There's really a question in my mind about whether or not there's any public safety benefit.""
\
Kurk would also eliminate a requirement that municipalities adopt the state building code, instead leaving it up to cities and towns. ""Some provisions of the code don't provide benefit but do raise the cost of construction,"" Kurk said.
\
One bill sponsored by Hollis Sen. Jim Luther, which has 18 co-sponsors, would require the Department of Labor to warn employers about violations before imposing a fine. Sponsors said the bill would apply only to businesses with paperwork violations that do not affect worker health or safety.
\
""We want to make sure we give ample opportunity to make it right without having an overly heavy hand of fines and violations,"" said Sen. Russell Prescott of Kingston, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee.
\
Some business owners say they would welcome a relaxing of regulations, particularly if it means less paperwork. Mark Coen, president of the leather manufacturing company Page Belting in Concord, said business owners already have to fill out too many forms, whether for reporting labor statistics or complying with manufacturing regulations. ""It can be a real burden on companies to have to fill out forms, then someone in the state bureaucracy has to file, read and act on them,"" Coen said.
\
But Democrats say regulations can be critical to protecting consumers.
\
""(Regulations) are viewed as an obstacle to business getting things done until something goes wrong,"" said Rep. Gary Richardson, an attorney and Hopkinton Democrat. ""Then everyone says, 'Why weren't there more regulations?' "" For example, Richardson said the state needs better regulations to protect people who buy home heating oil and to catch Ponzi schemes like the one perpetrated by Financial Resource Mortgage.
\
House Democratic Leader Terie Norelli of Portsmouth, who was House speaker for the last four years, said excessive regulations should be changed, but eliminating licensing requirements for professionals removes important consumer protections. ""Do we want to ensure New Hampshire continues to have a business-friendly climate? Absolutely,"" Norelli said. ""Is the trade-off worth having our citizens at risk? I don't think so.""
\
Two caucuses
\
For now, the bills represent a smorgasbord of ideas, and lawmakers have yet to coalesce around specific priorities. Bettencourt, of Salem, said the Republican House leadership will release its agenda in January. Meanwhile, two caucuses have started up to deal with business issues - one Democratic and one led by Republicans.
\
Richardson, who leads the Democratic business caucus, said the group plans to meet with business and industry groups and work to make state processes simpler and improve the business climate.
\
Manchester Rep. Mike Brunelle, executive director of the state Democratic Party, proposed several bills that could gain support from Democrats. One would increase the minimum wage. Another would give tax credits to small businesses who hire unemployed workers.
\
Both Brunelle and Norelli said they will fight Republican initiatives that they believe would make New Hampshire less competitive, for example, by lowering the high school dropout age from 18 to 16, repealing public kindergarten or repealing New Hampshire's participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program aimed at reducing pollution and investing in clean energy projects.
\
""Doing things that hurt the quality of life in our state certainly would discourage, not encourage, businesses small and large to relocate to New Hampshire,"" Norelli said.
\
The Republican-led business caucus, founded by Henniker Rep. Laurie Sanborn, is open to representatives of both parties who are committed to creating jobs and making New Hampshire more competitive, she said.
\
Bettencourt, vice chairman of that group, said the lawmakers will ask business owners to identify the most onerous regulations and they will try to eliminate regulations and possibly lower taxes.
\
""Certainly, you will not see this Legislature entertaining the possibility of an LLC tax or any raising of business taxes,"" Bettencourt said. ""It's critically important that we send a clear message to the business community in New Hampshire that this Legislature is here to help them, here to create an atmosphere where they can grow and flourish.""

A persistent pool of exceptionally warm Pacific Ocean water, known not so affectionately as The Blob, is warming America's Western coast. Cold water marine species are leaving, coral reefs are dying and winter storm damage is expected to increase.
\
Climate scientists say 2015 will easily top last year as the warmest ever recorded. Sea levels are rising faster than predicted, coastal storms are strengthening and droughts worsening.
\
A Republican entrepreneur who wants his party to take climate change seriously has donated a half-million dollars to Sen. Kelly Ayotte's re-election effort. Plunging energy prices just caused Canada to hit the brakes on the Keystone Pipeline to carry tar sands south through the United States, a plan Ayotte long supported. Polls show that a majority of Americans now believe that climate change is real and caused by pollution from human activity. Ayotte is in a tight race with New Hampshire's Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan, who has a strong record on environmental issues.
\
We believe, though don't know, that all those factors and more are responsible for Ayotte's emergence as an activist on climate change, at least by her party's standards. Whatever the reason, we welcome her to the cause of preserving the planet for future generations.
\
Ayotte has gone from doubter to believer in climate change over the years, and last month became one of four Republican senators to support President Obama's Clean Power Plan to reduce power plant emissions. She also joined with senator and presidential aspirant Lindsey Graham and Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Mark Kirby of Illinois to form the Senate Energy and Environment Working Group. The tack that group takes will say a lot about Ayotte's seriousness about climate change. It will, her office said, ""focus on ways we can protect our environment and climate while also bolstering clean energy innovation that helps drive job creation.""
\
The best way to do that is by doing something Ayotte has long opposed: tax the carbon emissions that come from extracting and burning fossil fuels.
\
Should she make that leap, Ayotte would join the company of some of her party's policy luminaries. Former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volker, George Shultz, who led the Office of Management and Budget under President Nixon and served as Ronald Reagan's Secretary of State, and Harvard economist Gregory Mankiw, chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, are all carbon tax supporters.
\
A carbon tax recognizes that fossil fuel energy comes at a cost to human health, the survival of species, damage from storms and coastal flooding, crop failures and the threat to national security that occurs when large numbers of starving or flooded out people are displaced. Applied across the board, it's a free-market response to a massive global problem. It would reduce emissions and fuel innovation and conservation while raising an estimated $2 trillion over a decade.
\
What to do with that money is the subject of debate. Some proponents of the tax want it to be revenue neutral with the money returned to utility customers or individual and corporate taxpayers. Others, and we're in their camp, believe that much of it should go toward rebuilding the nation's infrastructure, helping cities and towns prepare for coastal flooding and other ills of climate change, and making housing and education more affordable.
\
Those would be investments in America's future that we hope Ayotte comes to support.

Re ""Concord students should be made more aware of environment"" (Monitor Forum, May 9):
\
Kudos to Kyle Klose who described how Concord schools taught him to value critical thinking and creativity, and why this training is important in guiding him to find a sustainable lifestyle (one which recognizes limits).
\
However, I disagree with one of his statements. He said climate change is hard to talk about because there aren't clear-cut solutions. But there is a clear-cut solution to climate change: a carbon tax.
\
The reason we have a climate change problem is that fossil-fuel users are allowed to emit pollution into our atmosphere for free. A carbon pollution tax is levied on each type of fossil fuel based on how much carbon it emits into the air. The dirtiest fossil fuels will increase in price the most, and electricity from cleaner fossil fuels, solar and wind power would be able to compete against them. Our carbon emissions would drop.
\
Most proposals for carbon taxes rebate the revenue to households so folks can cope with rising energy prices. This solution is supported by Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, scientists, economists, legal scholars and policy wonks.
\
Why isn't Congress working on a carbon tax? Because Americans aren't writing and calling their representatives and senators daily asking for a carbon tax. Tell Sen. Kelly Ayotte you want a carbon tax. She will listen when enough constituents speak up.

Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative Republican, adviser to both presidents Bush and presidential candidate John McCain, believes the world's climate is changing and human activity could be to blame. But that's not what he emphasizes as he tours the country in tandem with environmentalists or the ambassador of Norway, a nation whose capital no longer can count on having enough snow for Nordic skiing. Instead, Holtz-Eakin talks primarily about the many other reasons why Congress should include a tax on carbon emissions as a component of a reform of the nation's absurdly complex tax code.
\
Holtz-Eakin stopped by the Monitor to make his case last week, and it was convincing. This paper has, for more than two decades, viewed global warming as a profound threat, so we were eager to learn why Holtz-Eakin, an economist and former head of the Congressional Budget Office, was willing to stump the country to build support for a carbon tax. He was, he said, doing so in hopes of providing business with the certainty it needs to grow, invest and create jobs. And he was doing it for the sake of national security. The less the United States has to rely on other nations, including nations whose interests are hostile to our own, for the energy that powers its economy, the more secure it will be.
\
Holtz-Eakin is a realist. He knows the current political climate is not conducive to action on climate change - or on anything else, we would add. But as one who has been both on top and in the political trenches, he sees an opportunity to act, and we think he's right.
\
No one, save for tax lawyers, likes the nation's 71,684-page tax code, a monstrosity that's evolved under massive pressure from lobbyists. Reforming the tax code is one of the few things that could win bipartisan agreement, even in an election season.
\
So far, no climate change bill has emerged from Congress without being burdened by additions and exclusions that doom it to fail. Tax reform legislation, by comparison, is far harder to swell with campaign paybacks, regional favors and other additives. It is a good vehicle, Holtz-Eakin said, on which a clean, revenue neutral, uncertainty-ending tax to combat climate change could ride. We agree.
\
Society can no longer afford to hide the true cost of burning a fossil fuel by passing it on to an often unwitting populace, whether that cost comes in the form of air pollution, a negative impact on human health, harm to the environment or climate change. A carbon tax is a recognition that those costs are real and should be a component in economic decisions that include whether to invest in a coal-fired power plant or a wind farm.
\
Holtz-Eakin believes that to pass, a carbon tax would have to be revenue neutral. The money the tax raises should be offset by reductions in things like payroll tax, income tax and corporate tax rate. If some of the money is diverted to another purpose, even one so worthy as energy conservation measures, he believes, it will fail. We hope he's wrong, because using some of the money to, say, subsidize the insulation of homes, would reduce carbon emissions even more, but we suspect he's right. The tax would have to be clean with revenue raised offset by revenue returned to taxpayers.
\
A carbon tax would reduce America's dependence on foreign oil, replace some environmental regulations with market forces, fuel investment in alternative energy and slow climate change. It should be included in any reform of the tax code.

62,"For the Monitor \Now is the time for New Hampshire lawmakers to place a value on Seabrook's carbon-free energy. Seabrook generates 52 percent of the state's electricity while emitting no air pollutants or greenhouse gases, yet it receives no recognition for its environmental attributes or its role in ensuring power reliability.\Due to competition from low-cost natural gas and heavily subsidized wind power, Seabrook is at high risk of being shuttered. Unless the state Legislature takes prompt action to correct distortions in the electricity market that tilt wholesale power purchases toward natural gas plants, Seabrook could be shut down.\We have already said farewell to several well-performing nuclear plants around the country. Since 2012, utilities have either closed or announced plans to shutter eleven reactors. This has been caused by the ultra-low cost of fracked natural gas, used in plants that pay no penalty for carbon dioxide emission. There is no carbon tax, but wind and solar are subsidized by construction tax credits, production tax credits and requirement that a certain amount be bought.\ As governments know, and the famous Supreme Court case in our history said, “The power to tax is the power to destroy.” New England has already lost Vermont Yankee, and the Pilgrim plant in Massachusetts is scheduled to close by June 2019, leaving only Seabrook and the Millstone plant in Connecticut as the region's remaining sources of nuclear-generated electricity.\Vermont Yankee's power is being replaced by natural gas power, and the CO2 emissions in New England have increased. Check ISO-New England's website.\Seabrook is vital to ensuring a reliable supply of electricity, now and for the future. Over the past three years, the 1,246-megawatt plant has produced power at nearly 90 percent of capacity, far higher than either natural gas or coal plants. And although renewables are emission-free, wind and solar power supply electricity only intermittently, at times when the wind is blowing and the sun is shining. Wind and solar require back-up power from fossil fuels when the weather isn't cooperating. By contrast, Seabrook produces large amounts of carbon-free energy reliably around the clock, day in and day out.\Make no mistake, the U.S. fleet of nuclear plants supplies nearly 60 percent of the nation's zero-carbon electricity. From the standpoint of climate policy, it won't work without nuclear power.\“You can't get to the type of carbon emissions people want to get to . . . unless you continue to use aggressive nuclear policy and have the nuclear fleet continue to function,” said former New Hampshire senator Judd Gregg, who is now co-chairman of Nuclear Matters, a national nuclear advocacy group.\There is an urgent need to implement public policies that keep Seabrook in operation. Closing it prematurely would be bad for consumers, energy security and the environment. It would lead to the burning of even more fossil fuels, adding to the burden of carbon in the atmosphere and making it impossible to meet EPA's Clean Power Plan, which calls for a 30 percent reduction in carbon emissions over 2005 levels by 2030.\There's something else to consider: Closing Seabrook would devastate communities near the plant.\Seabrook employs more than 650 well-paid employees with an annual payroll of $79 million, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute. The plant, moreover, pays over $23 million in state and local taxes, and it contributes $470 million to the local economy.\The transmission grid operator is concerned that increasing reliance on natural gas for electricity generation could lead to power shortages and volatile electricity prices. In 2014, on the coldest day of a “polar vortex” storm that pummeled the eastern United States, ISO New England, which operates the region's bulk power system, fell short of generating capacity from coal and gas plants. If not for nuclear power, the region would have experienced brownouts and blackouts. During that time Liquefied Natural Gas from Mideast tankers was bought and pumped into the pipelines. Wonder why the price of electricity spiked? Some energy policy!\Because the wholesale electricity market in New Hampshire is not correctly reflecting the environmental benefits of nuclear generation and the value that comes from fuel diversity, the state Legislature must intervene. Time is of the essence. We need a sense of urgency.\ (Howard Shaffer of Enfield is a nuclear engineer.)"
63,"Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte is seeking a second term in Washington, and facing a competitive re-election challenge from Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. Recent polls show the race in a near statistical tie. The contest has received substantial national attention, and outside money, because it could tip party control of the Senate. Ayotte has cast herself as a Republican willing to work across the aisle and break with her party on environmental and health issues.\\Ayotte, 48, was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010. She was previously the New Hampshire attorney general. In Washington, Ayotte has made a name for herself as a foreign policy hawk and she often aligns with Arizona Sen. John McCain and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. She serves on the Senate Armed Services and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees, among others. Ayotte lives in Nashua with her husband, Joseph Daley, who runs a landscape design and installation firm.\In the Senate, Ayotte co-sponsored a bill that sets up national prevention efforts and expands medically assisted treatment, used to wean people off heroin or other opioids. She joined onto a bipartisan effort to prevent people on the federal government's “no fly” list from buying guns.\Ayotte for most of the campaign supported Donald Trump's candidacy, but declined to endorse him. The word play earned ridicule from Democrats. Ayotte withdrew her support for Trump in October.\Economy\Ayotte has said a raise in minimum wage depends on the economic climate. She thinks the best way to raise pay is to grow the economy. She supports simplifying and reforming the tax code and lowering federal business taxes. The country, she said, should adopt a “globally-competitive corporate tax rate,” to lower business taxes for large and small businesses.\Ayotte has opposed the Democratic Paycheck Fairness Act, and instead favors a bill she sponsored called the GAP Act, which similarly aims to ensure women receive equal pay as men. Her plan doesn't go as far as the Democratic bill, supported by New Hampshire's senior senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat.\Ayotte supports a federal Balanced Budget Amendment.\Foreign policy\Ayotte opposes the Iran nuclear agreement she calls “dangerous.” She signed onto a letter in 2015 with 46 other Senate Republicans warning Iranian leaders that any deal could be undone by the next president and Congress.\She opposes President Obama's plan to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay. On the Syria conflict, Ayotte has called for the U.S. to undertake a “more aggressive” air campaign and run more special operations raids targeting ISIS leaders. On immigration, Ayotte has said securing the border is key. She backed the so-called “gang of eight” immigration compromise in 2013 that would have created a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. It did not get through Congress.\Education\On higher education, Ayotte said she supports letting students use Pell Grants toward short-term job training programs that last at least eight weeks. Currently, the grants can only be used to finance academic programs that are at least 15 weeks long, the average length of a college semester. Federal Pell Grants are need-based and unlike student loans, don't have to be repaid..\Gun policy\Ayotte has voted against efforts to expand background checks for purchases online and at gun shows, and has instead said Congress should “fix the current system.” Currently, only licensed firearm dealers have to run checks on prospective buyers. Ayotte supports further prosecutions of gun crimes and increasing mental health records given to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.\The Republican signed onto a bipartisan bill this year restricting gun sales to people on the federal government's “no-fly” list. The measure stalled and has yet to come up for a Senate vote.\Social Security\Ayotte has said she supports a “bipartisan” solution on Social Security that maintains benefits for retirees and preserves the program for generations to come. The Republican is open to so-called means-testing, or reducing benefits to high-income participants, but said she doesn't have any specific numbers in mind.\She has also voiced support for adjusting the payroll tax cap, but hasn't been specific about the threshold.\Transportation\Ayotte opposes a raise in the federal gas tax, which was last hiked in 1994 to the current rate of 18.4 cents. She instead supports the creation of a national infrastructure fund that could help finance road and bridge projects.\Health care \Ayotte has voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and calls it unaffordable for many New Hampshire families. She has said she wants to restore and expand Health Savings Accounts and double flexible spending accounts, which let people save their money tax free to cover health care costs.\Ayotte has voted to block federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a healthcare and abortion provider that runs five clinics in New Hampshire. Ayotte has sponsored a bill to make birth control available without a prescription, but the legislation came under fire from Democrats who say it undermines rules that mandate insurance coverage of contraception. Ayotte disputes the claim.\Environment\While she opposes a carbon tax, Ayotte was the first Republican in the U.S. Senate to publicly back the Environmental Protection Agency's proposal to reduce fossil fuel emissions. The Clean Power Plan aims to cut carbon emissions 32 percent by 2030.\Ayotte believes in an “all of the above” energy approach, which relies on renewable energy and on fossil fuels. Ayotte, along with most Senate Republicans, supported the Keystone XL pipeline, which was rejected by President Obama in 2015.\Ayotte called for full burial of Northern Pass, a transmission line set to run through the state.\– Allie Morris"

The U.S. Senate will soon vote on the 2008 Climate Security Act, a bill that institutes a cap-and-trade system to limit carbon dioxide emissions and allow polluters who reduce them below target levels to sell the right to pollute to others.
\
In the unlikely event that the bill passes, President Bush, who claims that capping emissions will harm the economy, will veto it. But bringing the bill up for a vote, even if it doesn't pass, will set the stage for real action to combat global warming when a new, environmentally re-sponsible president takes office.
\
A cap-and-trade system is far from the best way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. But it's the best that a Congress that depends on massive campaign contributions from the very polluters it's trying to control can do for now. And the need to act now is clear.
\
Last week, the U.S. Climate Change Science Program outlined the harm global warming is doing now to agriculture, weather and wildlife. That warning was followed by a peer-reviewed U.S. Department of Agriculture report that predicted that longer, more frequent draughts and temperature extremes would reduce yields of crops like corn and soybeans.
\
The details of the act are in flux, but in essence it sets emission targets and creates carbon allowances, some of which would be given to power plants, refineries and large industries and others that would be auctioned to the highest bidder. The money raised by selling the credits, says Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, a prime sponsor of the bill, would go to a ""private-public entity,"" the Climate Change Credit Corp., which would spend it ostensibly on measures that would further reduce global warming.
\
As Newsweek columnist Robert Samuelson recently pointed out, there are a host of flaws to this approach.
\
The act creates a huge new bureaucracy that will pick economic winners and losers. To win the support of senators from agricultural states, for example, the plan calls for allowing polluters to offset their emissions by paying farmers to plant trees or grow more crops without tilling the soil.
\
As carbon allowances grow scarce, their price will increase - as will the tax on energy users. Estimates of the amount of money the auctions will raise long term are in the trillions of dollars. Members of Congress love the thought of having all that money to dole out, money raised through a hidden tax on energy consumers. Lobbyists love the bill too, since they'll wind up with a substantial chunk of the revenue.
\
It's unclear how all that money will be spent. Will it be used to further subsidize the nuclear power industry or to help Americans who can't afford $5 per gallon heating oil or to insulate their homes? And who will lobby on behalf of poor homeowners?
\
A straight tax on carbon, as former vice president Al Gore argues, is a better approach. The tax could be revenue neutral - Gore suggests using it to replace the regressive payroll tax - or its revenue could be targeted to measures like insulating buildings and subsidizing clean sources of energy like solar and wind power.
\
In the current political climate, however, a carbon tax won't fly and a cap-and-trade system might. New Hampshire Sens. Judd Gregg and John Sununu should help Congress pass the act and show the world that the United States really is serious about protecting the environment by reducing its carbon footprint.

"
65,"What will Sununu do?\The Republican tax bill would add more than $1 trillion to the deficit, in addition to the amount that may be offset by economic growth caused by tax cuts. The largest tax cuts would go to millionaires and wealthy corporations. To pay for the budget-busting tax cuts, Republicans would repeal or limit deductions lower and middle-income taxpayers depend on, like those for student loan interest and state and local taxes.\ The bill would also repeal the penalty for violating the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate, which provides a financial incentive for people to get health insurance. This would encourage those who are currently healthy to drop their insurance, skewing the risk pool for the individual market and driving up premiums for everyone else. Many people not eligible for subsidies would be unable to afford insurance. Analyses show the number of uninsured Americans would increase by 4 million in 2018 and 13 million by 2027; in New Hampshire, 45,000 fewer people would be insured by 2025 and our state would lose $105 million in Medicare funding in 2018 alone.\Gov. Chris Sununu recently received a petition from more than 1,200 constituents asking him to oppose attempts like this to repeal parts of the ACA, and supporting efforts like the bipartisan Alexander-Murray bill to reduce premiums and stabilize insurance markets. The tax bill is not yet final; the governor has the opportunity to speak out against it. Will he side with his party or stand up for his constituents? We are watching closely.\CINDY WHITE\Hopkinton\A good approach to carbon\Reps. Michael Vose and Herb Vadney (Sunday Monitor Forum, Dec. 3) try hard to disparage the concept of a carbon tax, or “carbon fee and dividend,” an idea aimed at reducing CO2 emissions and backed by some well-known conservatives and libertarians due to its market-based approach. They offer a simplistic analysis, multiplying a plethora of hypothetical cost items by 20 percent, but fail to include in that analysis the effect of returning every dollar to the end consumers – the “dividend” part of the carbon tax concept that they themselves mention in their second paragraph.\The point of a carbon tax is that companies would pass along its cost; at every step along a supply chain buyers would tend to choose cheaper, thus presumably less carbon-using, products. For instance, with a carbon tax in place, it might be more (or less!) economical to manufacture and fill mayonnaise bottles in 200 places across the country – employing workers at each one – than to transport filled mayonnaise bottles all over the country from a single large plant. Consumers will ultimately “decide” based on retail price, which will have accumulated all the carbon-tax-based costs along the way from chicken to checkout.\A carbon tax would be implemented gradually to allow businesses to adjust.\There are a lot of details to assess. For example, some businesses might compensate for carbon costs by cutting costs elsewhere, as Vose and Vadney pointed out. Also, it might be better to implement at a national rather than a regional or state level because of issues related to imports from other regions. But because it gets government mostly out of the way, and uses the market instead of regulation to guide decision-making, the concept of carbon fee and dividend is being carefully looked at by people on both sides of the aisle.\JOHN MANN\Alstead\Out-of-place opinion\I suspect that a lot of Concord old timers and Patriots fans like me had a lot of difficulty understanding why the Monitor felt it appropriate and necessary to place the Washington Post's op-ed piece by Sally Jenkins on Rob Gronkowski's out-of-bounds cheap shot on a defenseless player as one of the many news columns in the Sports section of Tuesday's Monitor rather than on the Opinion page. Nothing in this letter should be construed in any way to support Gronkowski's cheap shot on a defenseless player or to dispute his rightful suspension as assessed by those empowered to make such decisions.\KURT SWENSON\Hopkinton\The enemy is us\We live in dark times.

We run to places such as Bears Ears, and the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument to restore peace to our minds and souls.\We fear North Korea and foreign terrorists are going to kill us and destroy our lives. Yet we have our own terrorism here at home. These terrorists are threatening and destroying ecosystems that give us life. A bounty has been put on wolves and bears who are murdered while asleep in their dens. African elephants are murdered, too, in cold blood as game.\Oil pipelines are leaking into the ground and our water resources. Natural disasters are not enough to destroy us. We destroy ourselves.\Bears Ears is going to be reduced by 85 percent to 315 square miles and the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument reduced by 3,000 square miles to 1,569 miles. The same terrorists do not believe in climate change and global warming, and remove protective laws and regulations from our environment. These actions are not making America great; temporary gain of greed is only temporary.\Once natural resources are destroyed, what will sustain us and our way of life? Our government has poured millions of dollars into other countries after they experienced mass destruction. We are raping our lands and murdering our animals. I ask who will come to our aid to save us from our self-inflicted destruction?\ALYCIA JORDAN\Concord\Hypocrisy on Israel\The 45th president says that the U.S. favors a “two-state solution.” How is this possible when Israeli's government continues to allow the construction of more and more illegal Jewish colonies (settlements) on stolen Palestinian land? It is so hypocritical of him to say that he wants peace between Israelis and Palestinians.\Almost the entire world condemns those illegal settlements as an impediment to real peace. Many of these “settlers” perpetrate acts of violence against Palestinians, burning their olive trees, poisoning their animals, and attacking and even killing innocent Palestinians. My organization does not condone Palestinian violence aimed at Israelis whether they are settlers, soldiers or innocent civilians.\If reports in the media are accurate, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was very upset in December 2016 that the U.N. Security Council was going to vote on Resolution 2334 that expressed criticism of Israel for supporting the expansion of these settlements. Apparently, Netanyahu contacted Trump's mediator for achieving peace between Israelis and Palestinians, Jared Kushner, to have someone in the transition team (Michael Flynn) pressure members of the Security Council to vote against Res. 2334. So, is the U.S. acting as an “honest broker” for peace? Incidentally, Kushner, his father and his father-in-law have donated money in support of these illegal “colonies.” So much for creating peace.\Concerning a two-state solution, Netanyahu as head of the Likud Party, knows full well that his party platform states that as long as his organization controls the government, there will never be an independent, sovereign Palestinian state.\WILLIAM THOMAS\Auburn\(The writer is a coordinator for N.H.

Even if not, we need names and an explanation of who set it up, and an accounting of all the money paid out to date, and names of those who benefited.\Investigative journalism, here is your chance to re-establish yourself.\Transparency, remember that word?

Shaheen.\As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, she'll be able to question Rex Tillerson during his secretary of state hearing.\Since Tillerson has spoken frequently about the value of a national carbon tax, his hearing would provide Shaheen with an opportunity to question him about carbon taxes, the relationship between climate change and foreign policy, his support for the Paris climate accord, and the role of the secretary of state in promoting American climate policy.\Readers should please write to Shaheen with questions they would like her to raise during Tillerson's hearing, such as:\Why is a carbon tax better for business and the environment than regulations?\How can Congress make carbon taxes non-regressive?\Why hasn't Tillerson lobbied for it?\Shaheen should also review a March 13, 2014, Senate Foreign Relations hearing on the Keystone XL pipeline during which climate scientist James Hansen spoke about the need for a national carbon tax and current committee chair Bob Corker agreed with Hansen that it's a good idea, but it's time hadn't come yet.\Perhaps Shaheen can encourage Tillerson to discuss: Is it time now? How will he know when it's time? What are the risks of waiting too long? These are questions Americans deserve to hear Tillerson answer.\JUDY WEISS\Brookline, Mass.\Hold him accountable\As we approach Inauguration Day 2017, we can only pray that the responsibility of governing will bring some discipline to the erratic, impulsive leadership style of Donald Trump.\Post-election behavior has not been encouraging. Trump's apparent bromance with Putin flies in the face of 70 years of bipartisan caution regarding our Russian adversary. There is little doubt that Putin wants to weaken the United States and its allies. In Trump, he appears to have found a willing pawn. Trump wants to move on to bigger and better things and downplay Russian cyber attacks. Apparently the bigger and better things include spending time with Kanye West and Don King rather than attending intelligence briefings.\Trump also fails to grasp the significance of his many conflicts of interest after condemning Hillary Clinton for her alleged pay to play schemes. He wants transparency but continues to hide his tax returns. He claims to support the blue-collar worker but has flooded his Cabinet appointments with elite billionaires. Rather than draining the swamp, he has further polluted it.\Another disturbing sign of things to come is Trump's continued reliance on Twitter to address complex and sensitive issues. As Jeb Bush pointed out, Trump insulted his way to the presidency. Now it appears he intends to tweet his way through communicating with the American people and bypassing the scrutiny of a free press. Trump has earned his chance to govern but it is incumbent on all of us to hold him accountable at every turn.\FRANK WARMAN\Hopkinton\Beyond party politics\In response to the supporters of Donald Trump who seem to want the issue of Russian hacking to just go away. First, while the term “alleged” is still used, 17 intelligence agencies both civilian and military agree there was hacking by the Russians.\Secondly, why is this even slightly a partisan issue? Regardless of who you supported, who you did or didn't vote for, every citizen of this country should be outraged. A foreign country tried to interfere with our electoral process. It doesn't matter if it influenced any votes; it is what was done that should scare us.\Some things should be American issues, not Republican or Democratic issues, and the integrity of our elections should be one of those things.\SUSANNE WHITBECK\Pembroke\Shockingly ridiculous\Archie Richards (Monitor Forum, Dec. 31) describes a happy place where nobody does wrong and all are omniscient. Here, nobody relies on others, like doctors, to live a long life. Everyone does everything on their own. This land often appears in the scribbling of Libertarians, but it does not exist.\His carpenter Scott needs government to support the environment that creates folks able to purchase his services. Richards leaves this obvious element of advanced society out. His absurd, seemingly factual but false statement that renewables are less efficient than fossil fuels ignores the entirety of the issue so he can make a simplified and false conclusion.\ Simply, Mr. Richards, when a wind farm is running it's not spewing greenhouse gases into the air. That's the efficiency we want. The writer ignores this, as apparently on Christmas Island, there is no climate change.\Government is in the position to enable society to make smart choices by setting standards when markets inherently encourage poor long-term behavior. MPG? Trans fats? Chlorofluorocarbons? Richards's carpenter can't do this; it's not in his field of vision. Besides, it's easier for Richards to call standards “interference.”\Richards ends with a shockingly ridiculous statement that Social Security is welfare. We all paid into this retirement-dignity system, Mr. Richards, and we all benefit.\Sadly, we've recently proven folks will believe what they want, with tragic consequences, despite clear factual evidence to the contrary. The Monitor should not be complicit by publishing items like Mr. Richards's. Please stop.\AARON GILL\Deering\A day of grieving\I have a wonderful suggestion for all Americans who oppose our incoming president. On Jan. 20, I would like Americans to wear a black armband or something black. This would show grieving of the American people.\LAURA HARWOOD\Concord\Obama and history\David Sandoe's letter (Monitor letters, Dec. 30) titled “An ungraceful exit” ignores President Obama's accomplishments.\President Obama inherited a country from George W. Bush that was on the brink of a major economic depression. The fact that it did not happen should be applauded. And Obama saved the U.S. auto industry from complete obliteration.\He also inherited two wars and avoided some others such as Libya, Syria and Ukraine. We are not the world's police force. He stemmed the bleeding of American lives in Iraq and Afghanistan.\He did this without abandoning our allies in these countries and negating the years of sacrifice we have made for these countries.\He leaves office with the economy in very good shape. Unemployment is the lowest it has been in years and job creation is strong.\We currently have all the oil we can use and fuel prices are low. We did this without the XL pipeline and without drilling for oil in the Arctic and on the continental East Coast. I would say that is pretty good.\The U.N. vote on Israel and Palestine does not make an Israel-Palestine solution any more distant or nearer than it has been for years. It is up to those entities to craft a peace solution and everyone recognizes that reality.\President Obama has done well in last eight years, and history will judge him well.\CRAIG L.

Thanks for the great editorial affirming the action by eight Northeastern governors to petition the EPA to force ""upwind"" states to reduce their power plant and factory pollution because the ozone and pollutants are harmful to our health and environment (""A breath of fresh air from governors,"" Monitor, Dec. 10).
\
However, your conclusion says the only regrettable part of the action is that only Democratic governors joined together in this petition. Yet there is another regrettable part of this action. It is expensive to comply with EPA regulations, and these costs are passed on to consumers. However, the federal government could accomplish the same end results (lowering fossil fuel emissions) if only Congress would enact a carbon tax, and then the tax revenue could be rebated to the public to help us cope with the rising prices.
\
Republicans like Sen. Kelly Ayotte usually prefer market-based solutions to problems (like a carbon tax), rather than regulatory solutions (EPA regulations). They usually prefer taxing things we don't want (like ozone pollution and greenhouse gas emissions) rather than things that we want (income, dividends). They usually prefer non-regressive taxes (like a carbon tax with rebate) rather than regressive taxes (like payroll taxes and sales taxes). What does Ayotte think about sponsoring a bipartisan, revenue-neutral carbon tax?

68,"On Monday, as representatives from scores of nations met in Morocco to address climate change, the World Meteorological Organization announced that 2016 would replace last year as the hottest on record.\\The news came hard on the heels of Donald Trump's successful quest to become president. Trump is a climate change denier famous for calling it a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese to depress America's economy. But climate change isn't a hoax, as Trump will learn if he talks not just to coal industry executives but to his fellow CEOs and Big B billionaire Bill Gates.\Some 78 CEOs, including the heads of Microsoft, Dow Chemical, PepsiCo, Philips Lighting, Toshiba, Unilever and Volvo joined to send a letter to world leaders at the climate conference in Paris last year. They want action to curb carbon emissions for the sake of the planet and corporate profits.\“We will act as ambassadors for climate action, focusing on solutions and economic opportunities and using ‘the science debate is over: climate change is real and addressable' as one of the common themes to raise public awareness,” their letter said. “We believe that effective climate policies have to include explicit or implicit prices on carbon achieved via market mechanisms or coherent legislative measures.”\Henry Paulson – a fellow billionaire Republican, former CEO of Goldman Sachs and treasury secretary for George W. Bush – also favors a carbon tax and called a failure to impose one “a very radical risk.”\The executives realize that climate change, which displaces tens of millions of people, is bad for business. Increasing energy efficiency and reducing waste increases profits, creates jobs and benefits the environment. It's a win-win.\“There's strong support for a meaningful price on carbon,” said Steve Howard, IKEA's head of sustainability. “We all want a policy framework that creates sufficient certainty that unlocks investment and innovation.”\Bill Gates, generally considered the world's richest person, is worried but optimistic: “If we just have today's technologies, will the world run the scary climate-change experiment of heating up the atmosphere and seeing what happens? You bet we will.” He has faith that technology can address the problem and business will act. “I don't think it's hopeless,” he said, “because it's about American innovation, American jobs, American leadership, and there are examples where this has gone very, very well.” That sounds a lot like something Trump would say.\Wal-Mart, the nation's biggest employer, has become a convert and called for climate change regulations. The company, one of the world's largest, has spent more than a decade cutting waste, transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy and selling “green” consumer goods. “I had embraced this idea that the world's climate is changing and that man played a part in that, and that Wal-Mart can play a part in reducing man's impact,” said former CEO Lee Scott, who launched the green effort in 2005.\“Global warming is real, now, and it must be addressed,” Scott said. “On a personal level, as you become a grandparent – I have a granddaughter – you also become more thoughtful about what will the world look like that she inherits.”\The president-elect is a grandparent several times over. His actions or inactions on global warming will potentially have a bigger effect on the outcome than anyone else on the planet to determine the kind of world his grandkids and the rest of their generation will inherit. We urge the incoming president to talk to his peers in the corporate world about why they see action to curb climate change as crucial."
69,"Monitor staff \Democrats accuse Kelly Ayotte of embracing environmental issues for political gain this election cycle, but the Republican U.S. senator says expanding renewable energy and increasing energy efficiency are among her priorities.\“I would like to be in a position to drive more bipartisan discussion around how we protect our environment,” Ayotte said in a recent interview with the Monitor editorial board.\Ayotte is locked in a competitive re-election campaign against Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. Recent polls show the race statistically tied, and the contest could determine party control of the U.S. Senate.\Ayotte has made conservation key to her campaign. While she opposes a carbon tax, Ayotte was the first Republican in the U.S. Senate to publicly back the Environmental Protection Agency's proposal to reduce fossil fuel emissions. The Clean Power Plan aims to cut carbon dioxide emissions 32 percent by 2030, but it faces intense opposition from Republicans and states reliant on coal.\Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wrote a letter to Hassan and other state governors urging them to defy the EPA plan last year.\Ayotte didn't specifically say how she would shore up support for the Clean Power Plan among her party. But she said she hopes to “build on” an energy and environmental Republican working group she established in Congress. “This is an issue that should be a strong bipartisan issue,” she said.\Ayotte said she supports energy efficiency and further research into renewables, like solar power storage. Ayotte believes in an “all of the above” energy approach, she said, which relies on renewable energy and on fossil fuels. Ayotte, along with most Senate Republicans, supported the Keystone XL pipeline, which was rejected by President Obama in 2015.\Democrats have hit Ayotte for two votes she took at the start of her six-year term to maintain tax breaks for the country's five major oil companies.\But Ayotte refuted the attack, calling it “cherry picking” her vote record. The Republican said she has supported bills to eliminate all energy subsidies that would make “the tax code even-handed.” Currently, the federal government gives various subsidies for energy sources ranging from oil and gas to wind.\Ayotte's grade from the liberal-leaning League of Conservation Voters has been on the rise since she took office in 2010. The organization scores lawmakers' votes on bills that deal with climate change, “dirty energy” and water, among others. It gave Ayotte a 56 percent last year, up from her zero percent score in 2014 and 31 percent in 2013.\On Social Security, Ayotte said she supports a “bipartisan” solution that maintains benefits for the retired and preserves the program for generations to come. Ayotte is open to so-called means-testing, or reducing benefits to high-income participants, but said she doesn't have any specific numbers in mind.\The Republican serves on the Senate Armed Services and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees. She supports the establishment of a so-called safe zone in Syria meant to protect residents from the ongoing civil war. But she said the step would require increased involvement from NATO.\Ayotte continues to stand by her decision to not hold hearings on  Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. She has said voters should “weigh in” on the decision by picking the next president.\Ayotte didn't answer directly whether she wants to see the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision on abortion overturned, but did say she is anti-abortion rights.\\(Allie Morris can be reached at 369-3307 or amorris@cmonitor.com.)"
70,"MORE THAN 1.6 million comments have flooded the website of the Environmental Protection Agency as it collects public input on a proposed plan to reduce carbon emissions from power plants in the United States.\The public comment period for the EPA's Clean Power Plan ended on Monday, six months after the plan was first proposed in June.\""The massive number of comments highlights the intense interest from both environmental groups hailing the rule as an historic effort to curb climate change, and business and energy groups who argue the sweeping regulations will choke the economy,"" according to an analysis of the feedback published in The Hill, which called the plan one of the most commented on proposals in EPA history.\A coalition of New Hampshire environmental groups applauded the occasion on Wednesday at Executive Council chambers in the State House, as the meeting with governor and council ended.\Democratic Councilors Debora Pignatelli and Colin Van Ostern joined about 35 representatives of groups like Environment New Hampshire and the League of Conservation Voters in celebrating the fact that 46,000 New Hampshire signatures were among those submitted to the EPA.\Officials at the EPA now have just six months, between now and June, to sift through all that material and ""get the rules out,"" according to Craig Wright, director of New Hampshire's Air Resources Division.\The rules are designed to reduce power plant carbon emissions 30 percent nationally by 2030, using 2005 levels as the benchmark.\New Hampshire is in a better position than most states, thanks in part to its participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative with eight of its neighbors in the Northeast, according to Wright.\""RGGI remains our best compliance option,"" he said, ""to tackle this from a regional approach.""\As other states begin to grapple with the new EPA rules, many are looking at New Hampshire and its RGGI partners as a model, even as a newly elected Republican Legislature is likely to try, once again, to pull the Granite State out of the program.\The nine states currently participating are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont. New Jersey was a participant, until Gov. Chris Christie removed the state from RGGI in 2011.\The program creates a financial incentive for power plant owners to reduce carbon emissions, or pay what opponents call a ""carbon tax,"" the proceeds of which are used to fund alternative energy sources and conservation efforts.\Since its inception in 2009, RGGI has already helped New Hampshire achieve substantial carbon reductions, according to Wright. He said New Hampshire should see a 55-percent reduction in carbon emissions from power plants by 2020 compared to 2005.\""We think we're pretty well set up for 2030,"" he said.\Programs like RGGI are likely to be launched across the country if the EPA rules survive the inevitable court and legislative challenges.\""The whole RGGI region is being seen as a model, as is California,"" said Dan Bakal, director of electric power at Ceres, a Boston-based environmental advocacy group that on Tuesday hosted a teleconference with businesses\that support the EPA effort. California launched its version of RGGI in January of 2013.\Despite the attention RGGI is getting nationally, New Hampshire has come close to pulling out of the program in recent years. In 2011 and 2012, bills were passed in the New Hampshire House and Senate to remove the state from RGGI. Republicans in the state Senate came up one vote short of overriding Gov. John Lynch's veto on both occasions.\State Rep. Richard Barry, R-Merrimack, who led the fight to pull New Hampshire out of the nine-state cooperative, is expected to try again next year.\""We're already at a position where we have one of the five highest energy costs in the nation,"" said Greg Moore, state director of the conservative policy group Americans for Prosperity. ""We need to start taking positive action to lower the cost of energy, not find ways to actually increase it.""\.\Power Plays is a weekly column on energy-related issues in New Hampshire.

71,"(Last week, we asked readers this question: “What single, achievable action do you believe would make the biggest difference in the fight against climate change?” Here are the responses we received.)\Stop funding the fossil fuel industry\Here is my answer, and it is not original. You can just follow the money and the answer to the question the Monitor has posed becomes clear. Bill McKibben wrote at length about this very same question in a recent New Yorker magazine article. What we need to do is to stop funding the fossil fuel industry. Lenders, insurers and investors need to stop funding and investing in the fossil fuel industry. People are mad. Some people are afraid. It's time to do something really meaningful that will accomplish a rollback to the speed with which our planet is being degraded by greed.\\CLAUDIA DAMON\Concord\We need a carbon tax\What single, achievable action do I believe would make the biggest difference in the fight against climate change? A carbon tax, applied to everything, no exceptions. It's the only universal and effective way to reduce carbon loading of the atmosphere.\PAUL HAGUE\Weare\Elect leaders who recognize the threat\David Brooks, a.k.a. Granite Geek, I don't want to say you burst my bubble (“Solving the ‘act globally' equation,” Monitor front page, Sept. 17), but frankly, you burst my bubble!\My individual efforts to reduce, reuse and recycle are not just a drop in the bucket of our efforts to avert climate change, they are a mere drop in the ocean of the efforts needed! Here we are in a small city (certainly by global standards) in a small state, but we are sitting right next to a coal-burning power plant that contributes in one hour more CO2 than I do in a quarter century, even before I start zealously reducing my own energy footprint!\Clearly, the solution is much higher up the chain of command. When we have a governor vetoing every single effort to reduce CO2 emissions, from nixing efforts to encourage our fledgling solar industry to vetoing the net metering cap, it's inescapable that we need to act politically. When we have a president who is so beholden to the fossil fuel industry that his idea of progress is to loosen every restriction on auto emissions states like California have struggled heroically to achieve, and to tear down every protection of our air, water and land previous administrations have put in place (which admittedly were only a bucketful in the ocean to begin with), we need to act politically.\So I believe that acting politically to elect leaders who recognize the threat of the climate crisis at least as well as our young people do is the single, most basic step we must take. But I think that is only the first step. In terms of actually slowing climate change we need to cut emissions in our transportation system, our biggest source of CO2. That means not only improving efficiency, but switching to clean energy. Our sun sends us clean power daily. In contrast to the dismal performance of our local power plant, our sun sends in a single hour all the energy the world and all its inhabitants use in a full year. Harnessing solar energy is happening now, but only with political and individual effort will it become more efficient, more affordable and more universal. Solar power needs to light our pathway forward. I'm going to continue to do my part to make that happen, and I encourage you to do yours.\MILLIE LaFONTAINE\Concord\Rethinking rebuilding\I was really happy to see David Brooks's column about our global crisis. His use of simple (not really) math to show that individual, well-meaning, conservation activities won't get the job done proves that it will take agreement and cooperation by all the world's countries to slow down global warming. You'll notice I didn't say stop the warming. Mother Nature has her own agenda and right now it is a warming trend. Nothing we can do about that, just accept it and plan for it.\Now to the question: You asked for a “single, achievable action” in the fight against climate change. The word achievable is the daunting challenge. Some will say my thought means surrendering to the inevitable, and I would say it means simply retreating, but here goes.\We need immediate state and nationwide legislation that prevents anyone from rebuilding, on the same footprint, all homes and businesses, sewage treatment plants, parks, etc., that are destroyed by hurricanes and/or rising sea levels attributed to global warming. Take the insurance money and, perhaps, some modest government assistance and rebuild on higher ground. Drastic? I don't think so.\For example, when New Orleans was devastated by Hurricane Katrina, why were people allowed to rebuild in an area where much of the city was originally built below sea level and protected (?) by levees. This idea won't fly well with those along our shores who want their piece of heaven protected by walls or other barriers (built by others, of course).\The town of Hampton recently took a baby step in the right direction by adopting a regulation that new buildings in certain areas must be built on stilts, in recognition of rising sea levels and future storms.\Sadly, it will be a long time before China and India, two of the world's worst polluters, join the team to seriously address this global issue so we might as well act locally while others talk globally.\GIL ROGERS\Bow\Pricing carbon\The single best action we can take to combat climate change would be to pass a carbon tax, or a cap and trade system. The idea is to start with a fairly high carbon fee and have it steadily increase over time. Stop having endless battles over which coal power plants should close, or what the automobile mileage standards should be, or what types of light bulbs we should use. Let the market know what carbon will cost and then let market forces figure out the details. It is a concept that has support from conservative economists as well as from former Republican treasury secretaries, Federal Reserve chairs, and presidential economic advisers, as well as from multiple Fortune 500 companies. This should be achievable.\Two things stand in the way. The first is Republican control of the U.S. Senate. We in New Hampshire are not in a position to do anything about that because we already have two Democratic senators. All we can do is support Sen. Jean Shaheen next year and hope enough other states replace their Republicans with Democrats.\The other obstacle is President Donald Trump. Just about all of the Democratic candidates support taking action to combat climate change, with many of them supporting either a carbon fee or a cap and trade system. Our special position as New Hampshire primary voters gives us the opportunity and the obligation to try to figure out which candidates will go to the mat for this, and which candidates are saying the words but won't follow through when the going gets tough. And I think the going will get tough on this. It is going to take political courage and leadership to get this done.\When Lyndon Johnson signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act, he told an aide “We have lost the South for a generation.” He knew it was politically dangerous but he pushed it through anyway because it was the only morally defensible thing to do. We need someone with that kind of courage in the climate change fight.\STEPHEN RASCHE\Canterbury\Change your diet\If you're serious about protecting the environment, the most important thing that you can do is to stop eating meat, eggs and dairy.\Feeding massive amounts of grain (that humans could eat) and water (that humans could drink) to farmed animals and then killing them and processing, transporting and storing the products is extremely energy-intensive. And forests – which absorb greenhouse gases – are cut down and often set on fire to supply pastureland and grow crops for farmed animals. Finally, the animals themselves and all the manure that they produce release even more greenhouse gases into our atmosphere.\There have been countless studies proving that going vegan or “plant-based” is the single best way to reverse climate change. The U.N. believes that a global shift toward plant-based food is vital to combat the worst effects of climate change. Globally, animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gases than all the world's transportation systems combined. Combined!\An Oxford University study, published in the journal Climatic Change, shows that meat-eaters are responsible for almost twice as many dietary greenhouse-gas emissions per day as vegetarians and about 2½ times as many as vegans.\I am not saying that we shouldn't take other steps to help the environment, such as reducing our use of plastics and fossil fuel, but the easiest way to make a difference is with our fork. You can start at your next meal, your next night out, your next grocery shopping trip. If you care about the health of the planet, you can make a difference by what you put on your plate.\LAURA SCOTT\Concord\What can we do? Vote\ The big question: “What single, achievable action do you believe would make the biggest difference in the fight against climate change.” The big answer: Vote.\If we do not get the naysayers out of office, we have no hope. It is the one individual thing we can each do that will have a positive, global impact.\The Republican Party, unfortunately, has chosen to be the party of the past, clinging to fossil fuels. President Trump is no surprise. As a candidate he denied the science; as president he has shown repeatedly, by his reversal of environmental protections, that he cares nothing about the planet. Gov. Sununu, a self-proclaimed environmental scientist, was a surprise – to me anyway. When he first became governor of New Hampshire, I had really hoped that he would work to address the carbon problem. Instead, he is following Donald Trump's marching orders. Leaders do not walk around with blinders on. The world needs the equivalent of another Manhattan Project. Will the United States, finally, take the lead to address a global threat? This can only happen if we vote people into office who take this seriously. This is not “diddly-squat.”\We need to look at the records of all local, state and federal candidates running for office. Get the facts; then vote. It is the single most important thing we can do to address this, the biggest question.\How many canaries have to die before we wake up?\JEANNE CUSSON\Concord"
72,"For the Monitor\In the first week of November, two important events emerged in the confluence of Washington, D.C.: The U.S. House unveiled a sweeping tax reform package, and the Trump administration released a sweeping report on climate change.\The House tax-reform package is silent on a carbon tax. However, the Climate Science Special Report released by the administration is far from silent about human-induced climate change. The report, mandated by Congress under a 1990 law signed by President George H.W. Bush and involving expertise from 13 federal agencies, states that the connection between the burning of fossil fuels and climate change and the warmest period in civilization is “unambiguous.”\Based upon scientific rigor and analysis, the 2017 report paints a clear picture of a changing climate: global temperature (up 1.8 degrees since 1901); sea level rise (8 inches since 1900, half of that rise since 1993); heavy rainfall (increasing in frequency and intensity); heatwaves (more frequent since the 1960s); and incidence of daily tidal flooding (accelerating in 25 U.S. coastal cities).\The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the highest it has been in 3 million years. Decelerating the use of fossil fuels is necessary in order to stabilize CO2 concentrations, and over 190 nations agreed with this assessment when they signed the Paris accord.\Today only the United States opposes the Paris climate accord.\The problem is greenhouse gas emissions, so what's the solution? To economists the answer is simple: tax fossil fuels, making them more expensive to use, and then return the revenue to businesses and people.\On the surface tax reform and climate change seem unrelated, yet a number of economists have said placing a price on carbon could find a spot in tax reform.\Eight years ago, in a briefing in the U.S. Senate, economists on both sides of the spectrum (Clinton Economic Advisor Philip Shapiro; American Enterprise Institute's Ken Greene) agreed that the most effective way to address higher fossil fuel prices resulting from a carbon tax would be to “recycle” the tax revenue back to the American people through the IRS and in doing so reduce corporate taxes (benefiting business) and payroll taxes (benefiting employers and employees).\Five years ago Reagan economist Arthur Laffer spoke in Manchester to a room full of New Hampshire conservatives on the subject of tax reform and explained his support for “swapping” a carbon tax for an income tax. He said later in an interview with N.H. Public Radio, “I think that would be very good for the economy and as an adjunct, it would reduce also carbon emissions into the environment. It would have that effect as well.”\The hundreds of pages in the tax reform package contain provisions that will be debated, discussed and ultimately forged into a new road map for families and businesses.\Sadly, it is unlikely a price on carbon will be part of the tax -reform debate under this administration and this Congress. Climate change solutions and tax reform seem to be, in the words of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, “Ships that pass in the night, and speak each other in passing . . . Only a look and a voice, then darkness again and a silence.”\The tool we have before us is the Clean Power Plan, America's first and only approach to federal limits on carbon pollution from existing power plants.\According to EPA's original analysis, a fully implemented Clean Power Plan would prevent 90,000 asthma attacks, 300,000 missed work and school days, and 3,600 premature deaths annually by 2030 – all while cutting the carbon pollution that contributes to climate change. Yet President Trump disavows the Clean Power Plan and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt intends to repeal it.\Repealing these standards puts polluters over people, at the expense of our communities. It will result in increased rates of respiratory illness and premature death, while worsening climate change and putting our economic growth at risk.\The EPA is holding one public hearing on the repeal in December – in West Virginia coal country. Everyone living in New Hampshire lives at the end of the nation's tailpipe. Clean air is at risk.\Oppose repeal and support public health, and call for U.S. leadership on climate action. Submit comments on the Clean Power Plan repeal. Comments are being accepted right now – they should be identified by Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2017-0355 and may be submitted online at epa.gov.\(Hunter Brownlie lives in Newmarket. Roger Stephenson lives in Stratham.)"
73,"Long view of climate change\Carbon dioxide recognizes no borders. It is not American, Indian, Chinese, Democratic or Republican. It is an important component of our atmosphere, which allows solar energy to reach the ground during the day and which retains heat at night.\The evidence is clear that the planet has heated significantly over the past century; that the rate of heating has increased in recent decades; that increased energy in the atmosphere is linked to extreme weather events becoming more common; and that they result in significant part from higher levels of CO2 generated in large part by burning fossil fuels\The climate is always changing, but the current rate of change is unprecedented in recorded history. It is too rapid for many living things to adapt. Animal and plant species are becoming endangered or going extinct at alarming rates.\As the dominant species on the planet, we can reduce the rate of global warming in a way which recognizes our individual and collective responsibility for the world we will leave behind and which puts the cost of reducing the problem on a primary cause, CO2.\A revenue-neutral carbon tax would reflect the cost of putting CO2 into the atmosphere and would rely on market forces, not government regulation, to address the problem. There is no real conflict between the environment and the economy. They go hand in hand.\The real conflict is between pursuing short-term gain and weighing future costs.\Bjorn Lange\Concord\Power grab\Gov. Chris Sununu's agents, Sen. John Reagan and Commissioner Frank Edelblut, are out to gut public education as Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos are doing at the federal level.\A nongermane amendment reorganizing the Department of Education is attached to a study bill (House Bill 356) and thus will not get a public hearing.\If passed, the amendment would, in part, allow the commissioner to:\Move state/federal funds to wherever he sees fit (eradicating accountability and potentially violating federal law)\Move employees to wherever he sees fit (violating the union contract)\Appoint directors of divisions based on political ideology rather than skill and expertise (violating RSA 21-N:3, II)\Determine the rate for special ed funding\Determine if a school is meeting the mandated “adequacy” standard for all students.\Amassing such power in the hands of one person reeks of authoritarianism, not democracy. Granted, bureaucracies can be cumbersome organizations. I know. I worked at the DOE for 17 years. That however, does not justify putting our children's education into the hands of politicos whose support of public education is at best questionable.\This also appears to be a back-door attempt to bust the union. Sununu is still angry his so-called right-to-work bill failed. With this amendment, state workers would no longer be protected from capricious whims of a “boss,” which is in part why people unionize in the first place.\Please, spread the word. Call or write your senators to vote no on HB 356 as amended.\Susan McKevitt\Bradford\Kindergarten matters\I support Senate Bill 191, which would establish the Kindergarten Initiative Development Support Grant Program. The bill is sponsored by, among others, Manchester-area state Sens. Lou D'Allesandro and Donna Soucy, and the late Sen. Scott McGilvray, each of whom have long supported quality education for our children.\Children who attend full-day kindergarten do better in the rest of their school years. My children, Peter and Justin, benefited greatly from their preschool and kindergarten experiences, and all children should have those same opportunities.\We also know from studies that those who go through full-day kindergarten in their early lives are less likely to misuse drugs or alcohol as they grow up. There are obvious other positive effects as well.\Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai recently spoke in Canadian Parliament. She was shot in Pakistan by a member of the Taliban in her effort to fight laws banning girls from attending school.\Yousafzai has been leading the effort for international prioritization of education for all children, and since recovering she has become a worldwide activist for children's education. She has said that, “When a country gives all its children secondary education, it cuts its risk of war in half.”\Kindergarten is an excellent way to get our children started on their learning process. It helps our economy, our society and certainly our families as well.\Please support this important need for the youth of all parts of our state. It is an investment, and should be part of our plan to design the future of New Hampshire for all of us.\Jim Normand\Manchester\(The writer is a former state representative and executive councilor.)"
74,"Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan is seeking to unseat Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte in the state's U.S. Senate contest. Polls show the race in a dead-heat and the contest has received substantial national attention because it could decide party control of the Senate. Hassan, a two-term governor, is casting herself as a bipartisan problem solver who is not afraid to break with her party on issues of national security.\\Hassan, 58, had previously spent six years in the state Senate representing a district near the Seacoast and during the last two she was the Democratic majority leader. Hassan lives in Newfields with her husband, Tom, the former head of Phillips Exeter Academy.\As governor, she signed bills to expand Medicaid and increase funding for addiction treatment. Hassan vetoed proposals to do away with a conceal carry gun license. While she came into the corner office in 2012 with plans to raise the state's minimum wage and expand gambling to generate new state revenue, neither proposal got through the state Legislature.\Hassan is a strong supporter of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, though she faced criticism this summer over an awkward exchange on CNN when she dodged a reporter's question three times on whether Clinton is trustworthy. Hassan later clarified she finds the former secretary of state trustworthy and honest.\Economy \Hassan supports raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour, up from the current rate of $7.25 on which New Hampshire relies. She has proposed a plan to implement a new $1,000 tax credit for middle class families earning less than $200,000 a year, and she plans to pay for it by eliminating tax subsidies for major oil companies and businesses that move jobs abroad.\She supports passing the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill senate Democrats have proposed in Washington as a way to close the gender pay gap. It has failed in the Republican-led chamber.\Foreign policy \Hassan aligns with Washington Democrats on some foreign policy initiatives, but breaks with her party on others. She advocates the U.S. enforce an “imperfect” nuclear agreement with Iran, and says the deal is the best way to prevent the country from obtaining dangerous weapons.\She opposes President Obama's plan to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay and is against the administration's Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. On the Syria conflict, Hassan has voiced support for additional airstrikes and expanding the use of targeted special forces to combat ISIS.\Hassan was the only Democratic governor out of more than two dozen who called for the U.S. to stop accepting Syrian refugees in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks last year. She stands by her call for a temporary pause, and hasn't specified whether she supports Clinton's proposal to bring in 65,000 refugees from Syria.\Education\Hassan supports expanding the federal Pell grant program, which are need-based and unlike student loans, don't have to be repaid. The current maximum grant is $5,815 for the 2016-17 school year.\Hassan also supports efforts to allow students to refinance their college loans at current interest rates and would back cutting interest rates for new student loans.\Gun policy\Hassan supports Senate Democrats' proposals to expand background checks for purchases online and at gun shows, measures that have stalled in the Republican-led Senate. Currently, only licensed firearm dealers have to run checks on prospective buyers.\Hassan has also called for an “appropriate, fair assault weapons ban.” She supports restricting gun sales to people on the federal government's terrorist watch list.\Social Security\Hassan pledges to fight efforts to privatize or cut Social Security, which is expected to become insolvent within 20 years. Hassan is open to adjusting the payroll tax cap so wealthier citizens pay more into the system. She hasn't been specific about how much the threshold should be raised.\Transportation\Hassan opposes a raise in the federal gas tax, which was last hiked in 1994 to the current rate of 18.4 cents. Hassan signed legislation as governor increasing the state gas tax by four cents.\Hassan supports the creation of a national infrastructure bank, an independent government corporation that would support and help finance road and bridge projects, among others.\Health care \Hassan says the federal government should “build on the progress” of the Affordable Care Act because it has allowed people to get insurance coverage who have pre-existing conditions. She supports repealing the medical device tax.\She supports federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a health care and abortion provider that runs five clinics in New Hampshire.\Environment\On environmental issues, Hassan has advocated ending federal tax subsidies for major oil companies, investing in “green-energy technology” and creating a national model rule for net metering, which lets homeowners sell electric companies their excess solar power.\She doesn't plan to initiate or support a carbon tax “right now,” she has said. Hassan has voiced support for setting a national target of 50 percent clean and carbon-free electricity by 2030.\On Northern Pass, a controversial transmission line set to run through New Hampshire, Hassan said she supports additional burial. But she thinks blasting required for underground burial in some areas could be more environmentally damaging than putting the line overhead.\– Allie Morris"

Here's how members of Congress voted on major issues in the week ending Friday.
\
House
\
10-Year Republican Budget: Voting 228 for and 199 against, the House on Wednesday approved a 10-year Republican fiscal plan (H Con Res 27) that seeks to balance the federal budget by fiscal 2024. This blueprint rules out tax increases and relies on mostly unspecified tax and spending cuts to reach balance, leaving decisions affecting trillions of dollars to House committees. The GOP budget would reduce spending by $5.5 trillion over 10 years through steps such as slashing domestic programs; converting Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program and food stamps to state-run block-grant programs; repealing the Dodd-Frank financial-regulation law; imposing work requirements on able-bodied adults as a condition of receiving certain federal benefits; devolving K-12 education programs to state and local governments; changing Medicare to a voucher program for persons now younger than 56 and repealing the Affordable Care Act without offering a specific replacement.
\
This budget would set 2016 federal spending at $3.79 trillion and provide $619 billion for defense. It would reduce Highway Trust Fund payments to states; cut the top individual tax rate from 39.6 percent to 25 percent; reduce the corporate rate from 35 percent to 25 percent and cut taxes on corporate profits earned overseas. The budget anticipates that Congress will reform the tax code to finance its tax cuts but offers no specifics on how that should be done.
\
Mimi Walters, a California Republican, said the GOP budget ""aims to strengthen vital programs like Medicare and Social Security in a fiscally responsible way so that we can fulfill the promises we have made to our nation's seniors,"" and ""boosts defense spending above the president's levels.""
\
Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, said this budget relies on ""a magic asterisk, hiding the specifics behind over $1 trillion in cuts in order to appear to balance it in its stated goal of nine years. No one . . . knows exactly what programs Republicans would cut or by how much.""
\
A yes vote was to adopt the Republican budget.
\
Voting yes: Frank Guinta a Republican
\
Voting no: Annie Kuster, a Democrat
\
Democratic Budget Plan: By a vote of 160 for and 264 against, the House on Wednesday defeated a Democratic budget that differed from the main GOP plan (H Con Res 27, above) by not seeking balance while spending far more for education, job training, early childhood intervention, scientific and medical research, transportation, infrastructure repair, environmental protection and other domestic programs. This budget would continue the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and other safety-net programs as presently structured while ending special-interest tax breaks in a way that would raise $1.8 trillion over 10 years from corporations and wealthy individuals. The Democratic blueprint would keep defense spending within statutory budget caps.
\
A yes vote was to adopt the Democratic budget.
\
Voting no: Guinta, Kuster.
\
Conservatives' Budget Plan: Voting 132 for and 294 against, the House on Wednesday defeated a 10-year budget authored by the conservative Republican Study Committee that would reach balance three years earlier than the mainstream GOP budget (H Con Res 27) would get there. This plan proposed deep cuts in domestic discretionary spending and entitlement programs. It would repeal the Affordable Care Act, and unlike the mainstream GOP budget, it offered a replacement health care law. Also in contrast to the mainstream plan, the conservative budget stayed clear of off-budget tactics for increasing the Pentagon budget. The entire $6.4 trillion that it proposed for military operations over 10 years would be subjected to the regular appropriations process.
\
A yes vote was to adopt the Republican Study Committee budget.
\
Voting no: Guinta, Kuster.
\
Progressives' Budget Plan: Voting 96 for and 330 against, the House on Wednesday defeated an alternative to H Con Res 27 (above) offered by the Congressional Progressive Caucus. With an emphasis on helping middle- and low-income families and workers, this so-called ""People's Budget"" proposed to begin universal pre-K education, end tax breaks for companies that send jobs overseas, permanently extend the earned-income and child tax credits, raise taxes on the wealthy, increase funding for education and job-training programs, relieve student debt, increase spending to repair roads and bridges, raise the minimum wage and expand the use of renewable energy to address climate change. This budget did not increase military spending or seek to reach balance over 10 years.
\
A yes vote was to adopt the Progressive Caucus budget.
\
Voting no: Guinta, Kuster
\
Black Caucus Budget Plan: Voting 120 for and 306 against, the House on Wednesday defeated an alternative to H Con Res 27 (above) offered by the Congressional Black Caucus. This plan would reduce annual deficits by $1.9 trillion over 10 years while ending the sequester and robustly funding programs for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) as well as programs to boost road and bridge construction, small businesses, manufacturing, affordable housing, job training, voting rights and the social safety net. This plan would increase the minimum wage and raise taxes on the wealthy, and unlike the mainstream GOP budget, it would continue traditional fee-for-service Medicare.
\
A yes vote was to adopt the Black Caucus budget.
\
Voting no: Guinta, Kuster
\
Bipartisan Health Care Changes: Voting 392 for and 37 against, the House on Thursday passed a bill (HR 2) drafted by Republican and Democratic leaders that would set higher reimbursement levels based on quality of care for doctors who treat Medicare patients. The bill would also extend the Children's Health Insurance Program for two years on a budget of $39.7 billion and fund rural and urban community health centers for two years at a cost of $7.2 billion. The bill is projected to cost $200 billion over 10 years, with $140 billion to be deficit spending. $35 billion coming from Medicare premium increases on well-off seniors and the remainder raised through a variety of fees and cost-cutting measures. The bill also would apply ""Hyde Amendment"" restrictions on the funding of abortion services provided by community health centers.
\
A yes vote was to send the bill to the Senate, where it stands a chance of passage.
\
Voting yes: Guinta, Kuster
\
Senate
\
Road Repairs vs. Tax Breaks: Voting 45 for and 52 against, the Senate on Tuesday defeated a Democratic amendment that sought to allocate an additional $478 billion over 10 years in the Senate budget resolution (S Con Res 11) to road and bridge repairs, with the increased spending to be offset by the elimination of certain corporate tax breaks.
\
Sponsor Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, said: ""Let's eliminate some of those loopholes, let's take that money, let's invest in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, let's make our country more efficient, more productive, safer and . . . create millions of jobs.""
\
James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, said the Environment and Public Works Committee that he chairs will shepherd through the Senate this year a bipartisan transportation bill addressing the problem of America's broken infrastructure.
\
A yes vote backed more spending for road and bridge repairs paid for by the elimination of corporate tax breaks.
\
Voting yes: Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat
\
Voting no: Kelly Ayotte, a Republican
\
10-Year Republican Budget: Voting 52 for and 46 against, the Senate on Thursday approved a Republican-drafted budget (S Con Res 11) for fiscal 2016-2025 that would boost military spending, repeal the Affordable Care Act, retain traditional Medicare, prohibit tax increases, slash spending for entitlement and domestic programs, convert Medicaid and food stamps to state-run block-grant programs and require an unspecified reform of the tax code. This budget would reduce non-defense discretionary and entitlement spending by $4.7 trillion over 10 years with the aim of balancing the federal budget by 2025. To help reach that goal, the budget requires $1.2 trillion in unspecified cuts in entitlement programs and assumes over $1 trillion in new revenue will materialize to replace revenue lost by repealing the 2010 health care law.
\
Mike Enzi, a Wyoming Republican, said the GOP ""protects our most vulnerable citizens, strengthens our national defense and improves economic growth and opportunity for hard-working families. A balanced budget means real accountability in Washington.""
\
Tom Udall, a New Mexico Democrat, said the budget's spending cuts ""would be piled on the backs of the middle class, the elderly and children. They would . . . slash Medicare and Medicaid, child care, Head Start, education, public safety and law enforcement . . . to pay for lower taxes for millionaires and billionaires.""
\
A yes vote was to adopt the Republican budget.
\
Voting yes: Ayotte
\
Voting no: Shaheen
\
Student-Loan Refinancing: Voting 46 for and 53 against, the Senate on Wednesday defeated an amendment to S Con Res 11 (above) that would allow up to 40 million borrowers to refinance their student loans down to interest rates prevailing in the 2013-2014 academic year. Those now holding Stafford undergraduate loans at 6.8 percent or higher, for example, could refinance to 3.86 percent. To offset its $5 billion-plus annual cost, the amendment would impose a 30 percent minimum tax on households with at least $1 million in income from salaries and/or investments.
\
Sponsor Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said her amendment presents ""a choice - protect a tax loophole for billionaires or give tens of millions of people a chance to refinance their student loans.""
\
Mike Enzi, a Wyoming Republican, said: ""Addressing college costs and the burden of high student debt loans must be a priority, but it can't be done on a budget bill"" such as this one.
\
A yes vote was to make room the 10-year GOP budget for student-loan refinancing.
\
Voting yes: Shaheen
\
Voting no: Ayotte
\
Ban On Carbon Tax: The Senate on Thursday voted, 58 for and 42 against, to give the Republican budget (S Con Res 11, above) authority to prohibit federal taxation of carbon emissions from sources such as coal.
\
Sponsor Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, said: ""This vote is important to send a clear message to the administration that Americans cannot afford to pay higher utility bills because of bad energy policies.""
\
Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, said that based on her state's experience with a carbon tax, ""I don't know why on Earth we would say no to something that leads to prosperity, jobs and a clean and healthy environment.""
\
A yes vote was to prohibit a federal tax on carbon emissions.
\
Voting yes: Ayotte
\
Voting no: Shaheen
\
Same-Sex Spousal Rights: Voting 57 for and 43 against, the Senate on Thursday adopted an amendment ensuring that the Republican budget (S Con Res 11, above) grants all legally married same-sex spouses equal access to spousal Social Security and veterans benefits regardless of whether the state where they live holds same-sex unions to be legal.
\
A yes vote was to adopt an amendment on behalf of legally married same-sex couples.
\
Voting yes: Shaheen, Ayotte
\
Seven Days' Paid Sick Leave: Voting 61 for and 39 against, the Senate on Thursday amended the Republican budget (S Con Res 11, above) so that it would not impede any new law entitling workers to seven days' paid sick leave per year. At present, the Family and Medical Leave Act allows qualified workers 12 weeks of job-protected unpaid leave per year.
\
A yes vote was to adopt an amendment in behalf of paid sick leave.
\
Voting yes: Shaheen, Ayotte
\
Key Votes Ahead
\
Congress is in Easter-Passover recess until the week of April 13.
"
76,"Monitor staff\Joe Biden promised a climate change revolution, and many voters think it's about time.\Climate change is quickly becoming a defining issue in the race for the 2020 Democratic nomination. And that means a candidate has to work hard for their policies to stand out in a crowded field.\Waiting in line for Biden's Concord town hall on Tuesday, Madison Britting, a pre-med student wearing a blue “Climate Strong” shirt, scrolled through the climate change plan Biden had released hours earlier. She had heard that the plan described as moderate before its release. She didn't like that.\“I kept hearing that ‘middle ground, middle ground,'” said Britting. “We're really in trouble. I think it's more than a middle ground issue.”\Biden's plan, which he calls a “clean energy revolution,” has since been labeled a “mini Green New Deal” and even a “gift for Trump.” The barrage of policies, totaling $1.7 trillion in federal spending in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, is the sixth comprehensive climate plan released by a Democratic presidential candidate. Jay Inslee, Beto O'Rourke, John Delaney, Michael Bennet and Elizabeth Warren have all released their own plans.\An April Gallup poll showed that most Americans, particularly in the Northeast, worry about global warming a “great deal or fair amount.” They believe it is serious and has already begun. A late April CNN poll showed 82 percent of Democrats believe “taking aggressive action to slow the effects of climate change” is “very important.”\A recent Harvard poll showed likely voters between 18 and 29 chose “Environment/Global Warming” as the issue that concerned them most.\At his Concord event, Biden shared his own worries.\“Climate change poses a genuinely existential threat to the environment – but not only to the environment – to our health, to our communities, to our national security, to our economic wellbeing,” said Biden.\His plan “is designed to fundamentally alter the way in which we treat the environment,” he said. How does it stack up against the other plans that have been released?\The plans\The six candidates that have released comprehensive plans to combat climate change agree on a couple things.\Each has promised to re-enter the Paris Agreement with stronger targets. Each has demonstrated concern for communities severely impacted by climate change, such as poor and minority people and coal workers. Each would eliminate fossil fuel subsidies.\Most importantly, these six candidates agree that overcoming climate change will require broad, transformative change.\Beto O'Rourke called this election America's “last chance” to address climate change. His plan calls for $1.5 trillion in federal spending to combat climate change over the course of a decade, which he claims would lead to another $3.5 trillion in private spending.\It also guarantees net-zero emissions by 2050, which would be achieved by “a legally enforceable standard” – seemingly a clean energy mandate. In the plan, O'Rourke promises to use executive action to reinstate and go beyond Obama-era climate regulations reversed by the Trump administration.\Climate change is Jay Inslee's marquee issue. The Washington governor has already rolled out three separate parts of his plan. So far, they add up to 103 pages, single-spaced.\His vision includes spending $3 trillion in federal money over a decade, which Inslee says would bring in another $6 trillion in private spending and create eight million jobs.\Inslee promises to close America's coal plants by 2030 America, require carbon neutrality in all electric utilities and new residential buildings, and make all new small cars and buses hit zero emissions.\In the release of the latest part of her climate vision, Elizabeth Warren compares the mobilization she imagines in response to climate change to that seen during the New Deal, World War II and the Space Race.\The Massachusetts senator describes her “Green Manufacturing Plan” as an example of “economic patriotism.” In it, she pledges to “invest $2 trillion over the next ten years in green research, manufacturing and exporting,” which she said would add 1.2 millions jobs.\She plans to dedicate $400 billion to the development of clean energy and wants to commit the government to buying clean energy products. Warren has already proposed a ban on oil and gas drilling on public land and offshore and wants to increase military readiness for climate change.\John Delaney's plan reminds readers that “limiting global warming to 1.5°C will require achieving net zero emissions by 2050.” America can get 90% there, it adds, with Delaney's proposed carbon fee and dividend, which would place an annually increasing fee on each ton of carbon emission and return generated money to taxpayers.\Delaney plans to invest in carbon capture technology and build “carbon throughways” to control the greenhouse gas for industrial use and sequestration. He also promises to raise the renewable energy research budget fivefold and create a ‘climate corps' of recent high school graduates in his plan.\Like his counterparts, Michael Bennet pledges to achieve net-zero emissions no later then 2050 in his plan. Bennet, however, does not offer a method for achieving net-zero, such as a carbon tax or a clean energy mandate. Bennet's plan includes a $1 trillion Climate Bank that he claims would “catalyze $10 trillion in private sector investment” in America and abroad and create 10 million jobs.\The plan would also require utilities to offer a “Climate X” zero emissions option to customers. In his plan, Bennet sets a timeline for actions and promises to use executive power if Congress fails to pass climate legislation by deadline.\In addition to net-zero emissions by 2050 and $1.7 trillion in federal spending, Biden's plan, which cites the Green New Deal as a “crucial framework,” includes a 100% clean energy mandate, which would need Congress's approval.\Like Bennet's, Biden's plan commits to conserving 30% of America's ocean and land. Like Warren, Biden promises to prepare military bases for climate change. Biden's plan also claims the US only accounts for 15% of global emissions and promises to push other countries, specifically China, to commit to greener regulations."

The pundits and pollsters assume it's a done deal: America is Red States and Blue States, and never the twain shall meet. As ""one nation, indivisible"" we've had our chance and, frankly, we've blown it. Now it's up to the big money interests to flood our airwaves with negative ads for 2016 and beyond. Gerrymandering has made most congressional districts safe for incumbents, so most voters won't have much a choice there. In fear of being labeled a ""moderate,"" candidates cater to their base, and this fires up those who shout the loudest, compromise the least, and punish anyone who strays from orthodoxy.
\
How did we get to this point?
\
Our views as Americans are increasingly based upon partisan ideology rather than upon facts and well-reasoned positions. The information to shape our views no longer comes from the likes of Edward R. Murrow, Walter Cronkite, John Chancellor, Huntley/Brinkley, Peter Jennings, or Tom Brokaw--white males all, but people who had the ability to pull us toward a common vision of what's right, what's decent, what's American (think: Murrow on Joe McCarthy, Cronkite on Vietnam). Now it's all Fox News or MSNBC (with PBS for the erudite, and the networks squeezing bits of news in between the drug ads). You pays your money and you gets your ideology, brimming with self-congratulation and pious rectitude. My views are the right ones. Those other guys are jerks. It's a formula for perpetual gridlock.
\
This polarization infects our vocabulary, else why have words like ""freedom"" or ""liberty"" become the exclusive property of conservatives, while ""fairness"" and ""equality"" seem to belong only to liberals?
\
Here's a summary of how we divide ourselves on issues like Poverty, the Economy, and Climate Change, problems that will only grow more dire unless we can cross the divide and reason together with those who don't always share our views:
\
As Conservatives View It . . .
\
POVERTY is caused by bad personal choices, poor values, lousy work habits, inadequate parenting, lack of initiative, or just bad luck.
\
SOLUTION: Better values and work habits, more personal and parental responsibility, sobriety, more private sector job growth, along with local and faith-based charity to provide a safety net for the deserving poor who truly cannot care for themselves.
\
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS stem from too big government, too many regulations on the private sector, deficit spending in absence of balanced budget.
\
SOLUTION: Let market forces operate freely, lower taxes, support entrepreneurship, reduce regulation of corporations and small businesses, weaken unions, and adopt policies that emphasize growth.
\
CLIMATE CHANGE causes are not well understood but likely to be due to cyclical patterns. Human/industrial impacts on the climate not proven, thus drastic measures to cut CO2 emissions are not warranted.
\
SOLUTION: We should wait for further data before acting to restrict use of fossil fuels or take other economically costly measures.
\
SOCIAL ISSUES: America is moving in the wrong direction, socially, in areas such as gay marriage, abortion, restrictions on religion, and lack of moral values.
\
SOLUTION: A return to more traditional values and norms in areas such as marriage, family, prayer in public spaces.
\
As Liberals View It . . .
\
POVERTY stems from social inequality, underfunded schools, lack of basic health, nutrition, housing and childcare, from racial and social class prejudice and low wage rates.
\
SOLUTION: Higher taxes to support better funded schools, more government programs in health, housing, nutrition, etc., higher minimum wage, affirmative action to end discrimination.
\
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS are caused by inadequate regulation of banks and Wall Street, too much power in corporations, regressive tax policies, income inequality.
\
SOLUTION: Regulate the financial sector to avoid boom and bust, raise taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations; government spending on infrastructure to create jobs; free higher education; higher wages.
\
CLIMATE CHANGE: Scientific data are quite conclusive: irreversible planet danger is imminent, with far-reaching, drastic impact on people and ecosystem, including drought, floods, rising ocean levels, mass migrations.
\
SOLUTION: Act immediately to reduce CO2 emissions via carbon tax, renewable energy. Action needed now at every level of society (personal, local, national, worldwide).
\
SOCIAL ISSUES: Despite recent gains in marriage equality, and due to increasing conservative control of state governments, Americans are in danger of losing hard-won rights in areas from abortion to voting.
\
SOLUTION: Supreme Court needs more liberal justices to reaffirm basic rights.
\
Is there any way back from our slide into political fundamentalism? Will Americans ever again support those who ""do what's right,"" rather than only those who ""think like I do""? On this anniversary of our Declaration of Independence, let us declare independence from such orthodoxy. For too long, we have refused to take the ""other side"" seriously.
\
Why is it so hard for ""Liberals"" to admit that personal responsibility and family values do play a huge role in the persistence of poverty from one generation to the next? Does empathy for the poor preclude acknowledging sociological truths? How can we champion marriage for gays and lesbians and yet ignore the proliferation of single-parent households in low-income and minority neighborhoods?
\
Why is it so hard for ""Conservatives"" to accept the overwhelming scientific evidence of global warming and its human causation? Isn't our planet itself worth ""conserving""? Do we really believe that more guns will protect us from the ravages of droughts, hurricanes, and from the 60 million refugees worldwide who are fleeing hostile environments?
\
Why can't ""Liberals"" concede that decades of bureaucratic tampering at the edges of inequality have failed to solve basic problems of poverty; that despite real gains for poor people due to food stamps and Medicaid, ""delivering services"" to people is not the same as ""empowering"" them to rise by their own individual and collective efforts?
\
Why has ""government"" become the enemy to so many ""Conservatives,"" even while they take advantage of every tax loophole and benefit from all that governments do to educate our children, make safe our food and airplanes, and secure our streets and our pensions? Why do ""red states"" rely more heavily on food stamps than ""blue states""--and yet vote against the expansion of Medicaid? How can we look at the condition of schools in poor neighborhoods, and the miserable wages of our service workers, and not feel ashamed? Has greed become the new American motto?
\
I find fundamental flaws in the reasoning of people with whom I mostly agree on these issues, even I despair at the inability of those I disagree with to face facts. In the June 17 New York Times, Tom Friedman laments the purging of moderates by Republicans and the leftward polarization of many Democrats. And in the absence of what he calls ""the hybrid/ centrist blends"" among our leaders, he warns that ""there is little chance you will pass on the American dream to your kids."" He deplores our political paralysis that won't allow a carbon tax to control global warming, or an easing of the burden of student loans to help young people find their footing in our economy.
\
""Partisanship,"" he writes, ""is vital to a healthy democracy -- but not when it becomes an end in itself, just an engine for politicians to raise more money to win more elections to raise more money -- without ever daring to stop and challenge their own base when necessary. In Silicon Valley, collaboration is how you build great products with others. In Washington, it's how you destroy your career."" I agree. We must break with orthodoxy and embrace a broader vision or else we will be held responsible for making our society unworkable for our grandchildren, and our planet unlivable for theirs. We must start with ourselves, scrutinizing our addiction to monolithic, knee-jerk thinking, our habit of listening only to those ready to tell us we're always ""right."" Then we must take on those in power who determine national and global policy.
\
Every politician on the losing side of the last election talks boldly about ""taking our country back"" as if it had been captured by ""the enemy."" Here in New Hampshire, we must confront visiting candidates from both parties--in town meetings and house parties--by demanding that they challenge unreason in their base, orthodoxy in their Party, and gridlock in our legislatures. If we can do that, we will have demonstrated the courage to envision, once again, a United States of America.

It so angers me that Connecticut and other southern New England states feel they have the right to desecrate, bulldoze, scrape the tops, and rape New Hampshire's mountain ridges, pollute its brooks, rivers and lakes just to erect 45-story-high wind turbines to supply their electricity. Let them desecrate and destroy their own ridges rather than taking away New Hampshire's signature landmarks.

There are far, far worse things than windmills
\
The question ""Are windmills paragons of environmental beauty or terrible eyesores?"" distracts from the real issue. We should grab the bull by the horn and state the problem: ""Should we convert to clean renewable energy sources, or let the greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels heat our planet to an inhabitable level?""
\
However, since the Monitor posed the windmill question, I feel compelled to respond. What is awful is mountaintop removal in Appalachia, blasting the tops off mountains to quickly access the coal layer, burying streams and permanently destroying thousands of acres of natural habitats. What is awful is the mercury and toxic-filled air around coal country, causing excessive cancer victims, and young children gasping for air from asthma.
\
What is awful is the huge coal pits in Columbia, and worker conditions, all created to provide us with cheap fuel for electricity. What is awful is the run-off from the Fukushima disaster, with continued radiation leaking in to the Pacific ocean.
\
Europe has become a mecca of windmills, and still we flock to Europe as tourists, enjoying the magnificent beauty. Interestingly, there is no human ""wind syndrome"" dysfunction in Europe. And to the ""bird"" objection, note this: In the U.S. in 2009, only about 46,000 avian mortalities were reportedly associated with wind farms, while nuclear plants killed about 458,000 birds, and fossil-fueled power plants almost 24 million.
\
Wind farms create jobs, too. In fact, it's a rapidly-growing segment of our economy. In contrast, newer coal-removal techniques, such as mountain top removal, feature large machinery, lots of fossil fuel use, and far fewer jobs. And coal extraction communities have always been linked with poverty, in addition to ill health.
\
I urge anyone who is anti-wind to do some research on the fundamental fuel source for their electricity. And I mean go beyond the Bow coal plant, to the origin of the coal, the environmental and worker conditions there, and the sustainability of this process. Then look your children, your grandchildren, your nieces and nephews in the eye and say ""I'm against wind power."" Anyone with a moral compass, with concern about the future, cannot, in good faith, do so.

Assault on the environment
\
As a resident of the Newfound Region, I am disgusted by the invasion of industrial wind projects. I see Groton Wind as an assault on the environment and the well being of people left dealing with reduced property values, loss of quality of life and strife within their communities.
\
Nearby residents live with flashing red lights at night, roaring industrial engines, shadow flicker from the blades for hours at a time, the whooshing of blades as they spin, and low-frequency vibrations felt within the body.
\
The Newfound watershed is of great concern, as it provides our drinking water. Industrial wind turbine construction will alter the flow of ground water affecting the watershed in ways no human can predict.
\
I have lived here for almost a decade and enjoyed the numerous sightings of red-tailed hawks, bald eagles, owls, blue heron, bats, migrating Canada geese and other seasonal birds, moose, black bear, coyotes, fox and even a wolf or two. Raptors rely on thermal currents provided by the Newfound ridge lines to feed. It is not wise to place 500-foot industrial turbines with blades larger then a 747 spinning at speeds that can reach well over 100 mph directly in the path of such animals that help to control mosquitoes and rodents.
\
I see few economic benefits. There may be a handful of temporary local jobs created but not guaranteed. There will be only a few permanent jobs created and those are not guaranteed to be filled by local residents either. PILOT payments made to host towns only reduce the ""town portion"" of your tax by a minimal amount. The rest of the money can be used to increase town employees' payroll or benefits, purchase new equipment, upgrade roads, etc. It is unlikely taxpayers will see any significant reduction in property taxes unless they receive an abatement for the reduced value of their property. Those who benefit most are the landowners leasing their land to the industrial wind company, and of course, the foreign-owned industrial wind companies.
\
Industrial wind is not just an eyesore issue. This is a quality of life issue, environmental issue, community well being issue, political issue and economic issue.

Lanky beauties
\
The Monitor's Sept. 27 photographs of our windmills do not do them justice.
\
As residents of Dorchester who travel Route 25 each day to and from Plymouth, my husband and I have come to love these lanky beauties. As everyone in the Baker Valley knows, we have very variable weather. So not only each day, but at various times of the day, the windmills offer majestic juxtapositions with the fog, clouds and sun. They provide plenty of conversation as we wonder why some seem to be turning at different rates, some facing different directions, etc.
\
We have a friend who lives across the Baker River from the windmills and was very concerned when so many people seemed to be opposed to the windmills while they were going through the rigorous permission process. The misinformation machine was hard at work! She now loves to look out her window and enjoy our glorious, pollution free, environmentally friendly power mills dancing. We had told her not to worry as we had seen so many on mountains, hills and plains in our travels and had been exposed to their beauty and we have been proved correct. They doesn't seem to interfere with tourism in other countries.
\
In addition, even if we didn't enjoy the interaction of the windmills with nature, we would be thankful to the people of Groton who welcomed wind power to our neighborhood. To us, each tower is a symbol of a U.S. soldier who does not have to go to the Middle East to protect our ""national security"" better known as ""oil interests,"" an American's well that will remain unpolluted due to fracking and a mountaintop not exploded for coal. Thank you, Groton, for bringing these beauties to our neighborhood; let's hope we can expand this effort to other neighboring communities.

What about the neighbors?
\
There was no mention in the Monitor's Sept. 27 editorial on wind power about the impact of industrial wind projects on people. How about the neighbors - remember us?
\
Groton Wind changed two turbine locations and built its operations and maintenance building in a non-certificated site, resulting in lack of vegetative buffer from neighboring residences. Claims are still on the open docket. Groton Wind failed to submit review plans for fire suppression and has operated for nine months without a certificate of occupancy, placing people in danger. EDP Renewables submitted an application to the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection for an energy contract, stating project feedback from local, regional and state officials has been very positive. How? Several towns in the area made public statements opposing industrial wind development. The project is located predominantly in remote forestland, which provides a screening effect, which will minimize the visual impact within the surrounding community. How do you screen 500-foot tall turbines located on a ridgeline?
\
Residents of surrounding towns are reporting violations to the state because the state is not enforcing compliance. And now there are plans in the making for three more wind projects. Who will enforce the laws? Residents are bringing to light wind companies' false statements because no one else is watching. The wind companies are here to make money and don't care about the public welfare. People have the right to live safely and contently in their homes. Stop promoting these companies who are not good neighbors.

No different from Norther Pass towers
\
Wind turbines are no different from the Northern Pass transmission towers. I object to both on aesthetic grounds. They mar the landscape. They ruin views. They are a barrier between beauty and those who wish to admire and appreciate that beauty.
\
I care deeply about the environment. I have supported this cause in a number of ways for the past 40 years. The reason I became involved and the primary reason I stay involved is a love of nature and the visual gifts it brings to humanity. We are all stewards of the Earth, charged with valuing and protecting it in the present, for the future. I do not support any project, whether it be considered ""green"" or not, which significantly alters the treasured vistas we inherited from those who came before us. Being an environmental advocate can mean many things. To me it means defending the beauty around us from those who would defile it. Natural, by definition, does not mean man-made. Towers of any kind do not enhance the natural environment.

Energy meets ballet
\
On a recent drive to the heartland, and through Pennsylvania especially, I came across a number of wind generator installations. At one site I counted maybe 20 machines, with their slender white blades slowly rotating in the wind. On the ridges across the valleys the first vision that came to my mind were those of ballerinas waving their long and delicate arms to beautiful music. The word I would use to describe these machines and their movement is graceful. Artful sculptures they may not be, but it's hard to think of any other energy generators more pleasing to the eye.

Three big reasons
\
Wind farms are a good idea because, one, they represent 100 percent clean energy that does not have a limited supply, two, the power company will have to pay taxes for the property they reside on, which means they will benefit our economy, and three, they will create new jobs. Who cares if it doesn't look great? It doesn't look horrible either, and it will only benefit us.

In some circumstance okay; in others, not
\
When I see one or two relatively short wind turbines in developed areas, such as from Interstate 93 in Somerville/Charlestown, Mass., or from Route 3 in Kingston and Bourne, Mass., I find them intrusive but acceptable. When I see many tall (almost 500 feet) on New Hampshire ridge lines from remote roads and recreation areas such as Cardigan Mountain and Newfound Lake, I find them very objectionable. They pollute what is otherwise a mostly natural and beautiful setting which is an attraction to tourists, vacationers and those seeking outdoor activities.

Wind projects will kill tourism
\
I am disappointed in the Monitor's Sept. 27 editorial (""Shift from fossil fuels is under way""). I find it disturbing that you meet with people of these wind companies without researching the impact environmentally or economically or mentioning where future projects in New Hampshire are being proposed.
\
Just who is getting the price of $0.08kw? Who will benefit from these wind farms? Massachusetts and Connecticut, not New Hampshire. Connecticut is pushing hard to have these windmills built here in New Hampshire while having referenda in its own state preventing wind farms from being built there. People there want the power; they don't want the product that generates wind power. Why is that?
\
The proposed projects you failed to mention are all around Newfound Lake along the ridge lines near Mount Cardigan and Sugar Hill. Newfound is the cleanest lake due to it being spring fed. Surrounding communities are dependent on tourism the lake brings. Who is going to want to come stay when the water becomes polluted from the runoff that will enter the lake's watersheds? Who will ever enjoy a starlit night on the lake when all they can see is blinking red lights from the tallest turbines in the country? Who will come to the lake known for its scenic views when all they can see are wind turbines? The wildlife such as bald eagles and loons that have returned in recent years - how will they be affected?
\
Do you honestly believe this will not have a huge negative impact environmentally and to tourism economy to the area? I agree things need to change, but I don't believe in destroying what brings people and tourist money to our state and beautiful lake. Please research completely before making such a blanket stand. Not green! Not clean! Not cheap!

Re ""Shift from fossil fuels is under way"" (Monitor editorial, Sept. 27):
\
Keep up your great work on energy, the environment and climate change! I was delighted to hear that the Monitor's editors had a meeting with representatives of wind energy companies. I hope your efforts create the political will to inspire Sens. Kelly Ayotte and Jeanne Shaheen to co-sponsor national bipartisan climate change legislation.
\
Jim Rubens, recently announced candidate for the Republican nomination to run against Shaheen in 2014 has expressed concern about climate change and his support for a carbon tax to replace income and corporate taxes. If a Republican candidate for Senate is willing to talk about his belief in climate science and the need for a market-based revenue-neutral solution to climate change that will make renewable energy even more competitive against fossil fuels, then the time is clearly ripe for New Hampshire's current senators to co-sponsor such legislation.

Off the mark
\
Re ""Shift from fossil fuels is under way"" (Monitor editorial, Sept. 27):
\
The Monitor's stand on wind farms in New Hampshire is grossly off the mark. For the state to take away every zoning law in all New Hampshire towns is an incredible breach of democratic process. And to risk all esthetic values and the loss of our second largest source of revenue from tourism is not the way to energize New Hampshire.
\
Please, listen to the people who have overwhelmingly voiced their opposition to this in town after town all over the state.
\
Thank you for your consideration of all the aspects and consequences of the proposals being considered and editorialize appropriately.

We're being used
\
Anyone who thinks that wind turbines are ""cool landmarks"" has very little understanding of the issues involved. Take a closer look: the acres of clear-cutting along the ridge lines; the resultant dirty runoff muddying our rivers, streams and lakes; the 100-mph blade tips potentially killing eagles and bats; the all-night lights that the FAA requires.
\
More important, how ""cool"" will these ""landmarks"" look years hence, when they become obsolete, the federal subsidies run out, and the foreign companies who built them leave rusting, useless, monstrous eyesores dotting our countryside?
\
New Hampshire, being a net exporter of energy, doesn't need the power; Connecticut and Massachusetts do. So why should we allow the natural beauty of our landscape to be compromised for the benefit of those states? Folks, wake up; we're being used! If those states want wind power, let them build the wind turbines there!

Not clean, not green
\
Wind energy is among the least effective of renewable energy options, both economically and environmentally. We oppose the continued destruction of our state's most precious natural resources at the hands of industrial wind developers.
\
If the wind energy production in New Hampshire is so abundant, why is the wind energy generation output not ever provided to the public?
\
Wind energy on the New Hampshire ridgelines is not cheap, it is not green, it is not clean, it is not reliable and it is definitely not wanted. The towns around the Newfound Lake and Cardigan Mountain areas are strongly opposed to any additional industrial wind plants and have made that clear through town votes. All it takes is a drive through the area to see very clearly that industrial wind turbines are not wanted.
\
As recently stated by Gov. Maggie Hassan in her Boston Globe column, ""Our natural resources and natural beauty are also essential to our travel and tourism economy - our second largest industry - which generates billions of dollars and creates thousands of jobs. Year-round, visitors come from across the country and around the world to ski our mountains, hike our trails and kayak on our lakes.""
\
We need to preserve the beauty of our state, not allow industrial wind turbines to forever destroy our beautiful scenery and pristine lake. Why should New Hampshire be expected to sacrifice our economy and quality of life to help Massachusetts meet its Renewable Portfolio Standards goal?

Not as good as you think
\
Re ""Shift from fossil fuels is under way"" (Monitor editorial, Sept. 27):
\
Are you aware that the Los Angeles Times and New York Times have both written articles that refute your headline and basic premise?
\
Please read ""Rise in renewable energy will require more use of fossil fuels"" (Los Angeles Times, Dec. 9, 2012). If you're still not convinced that the information you received from the group of industrial wind developers you sourced is not quite as accurate as your editorial gives it credit for being, then please read ""Germany's efforts at clean energy prove complex - emissions still rising, along with the costs"" (New York Times, Sept. 19).
\
These articles clearly point out that wind is more redundant than renewable. Wind is not a base-load power provider; base-load power providers (fossil fuel or nuclear) do not, as these articles point out, shut down during the intermittent, sporadic and unpredictable times wind actually makes it onto the grid ithout being curtailed as it often has been here in New England.
\
There are significant cost and emission consequences as both articles clearly point out. California and Germany are real-world examples of what happens with industrial wind.

79,"New Hampshire Union Leader\MANCHESTER -- Deficit spending has the United States fast approaching a financial ""tipping point"" experts say and the country needs strong leadership to sell the tough solutions to change course.\Speakers at the University of New Hampshire and Concord Coalition event Wednesday on fiscal and environmental sustainability painted a bleak view of the country's future without significant fiscal changes. They said spending over the last 40 years has the country facing debts it cannot repay under the current tax system.\""We don't have a choice. Doing nothing is not an option,"" said David Walker, former comptroller general under the Clinton administration and now CEO of the Comeback America Initiative. ""You have to make the political price associated with doing nothing greater than the political price of doing something.""\A package of revenue increases and spending cuts agreed to by members of both parties is needed, not rhetoric about smaller government and taxing the rich, several speakers said.\The biggest deficit this country has is leadership across all sectors -- government and corporate -- that is focused on short-term, selfish gains instead of investments that will make the future better, Walker said. ""We need to come back to the values that made this country great.""\He said the federal deficit is a moral issue as well as fiscal, noting each person in this country owes the equivalent of $200,000 in debt. ""Instead of talking about the death tax, we ought to be talking about the birth burden,"" Walker said.\Speakers differed on whether to begin the discussion by deciding what size government should be or whether to reform or overhaul the tax system.\Joseph V. Minarik of Committee for Economic Development said the current tax system is inefficient with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the developed world. He serves on the Bipartisan Debt Reduction Task Force that suggests overhauling the tax system by reducing individual income tax rates while eliminating most deductions, instituting a national sales tax dedicated to reducing the deficit and taxing health insurance benefits.\He and tax attorney William Ardinger of Rath, Young and Pignatelli said New Hampshire's business enterprise tax captures business activity such as mail order and internet sales other states and the federal government have difficulty collecting.\""The dirty little secret we have in New Hampshire is we have a VAT (value added tax) and we've had a VAT since 1993,"" said Ardinger, who helped write the tax for the Steve Merrill administration.\While everyone hates a VAT, he said, the business enterprise tax shifts the tax base from income to consumption, which is more economically neutral.\The ""Sustainable Future: How Can Our Nation Turn the Corner on the Economy and the Environment and Can New Hampshire Lead the Way?"" event had a goal of developing two questions New Hampshire citizens could ask Presidential candidates.\Ross Gittell, professor at UNH's Whittemore School of Business and Economics, said environmental and fiscal sustainability are needed or our way of life will be damaged. ""Every day we wait to address our fiscal challenges, and every day we wait to address our environmental challenges, the more difficult the problems will be,"" he said.\Richard Ober, president of New Hampshire Charitable Trust Foundation, said New Hampshire has always had a practical, sensible frugality that valued investments intended to make the future better.\""This is about sustainability and vision. Look at the stone walls that criss-cross northern New England,"" he said. ""The farming communities in northern New England were self-contained ... They had it figured out 100 years ago.""\He said that same kind of sensibility needs to be brought to the problems today.\Former Air Resource Division director Ken Colburn suggested New Hampshire consider a carbon tax in order to address both the environmental and fiscal issues facing the state.\""With a carbon tax, you tax what you burn, not what you earn,"" he said."
80,"
A few weeks ago, after conducting a multi-year study funded in fair measure by the ultra-conservative billionaire Koch brothers, University of California professor Richard Muller, one of the more credible skeptics of global warming, announced his findings. The great majority of scientists who claimed that the world's climate was warming at a fair clip, Muller said, are right.
\
Muller's findings produced a gamut of responses. In climate skeptic circles, he had committed apostasy. In the broader scientific community the reaction was essentially, ""What took you so long? Didn't you notice that the glaciers are disappearing, permafrost melting, sea level rising and polar bears drowning?""
\
Last month, nine Democrats in the U.S. House decided to swim upstream through the sewage that is Washington politics to introduce the Save Our Climate Act, a bill that would impose, at its onset, a $10 per ton tax on carbon dioxide emissions. Their goal is to reduce emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels.
\
In the current political climate, for such a bill to stand a chance, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's ice cream cone would have to melt all over his hand before he could raise it to his mouth. But the act's proponents shouldn't give up. With a presidential race under way and major contenders like Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney campaigning on ""drill, baby, drill"" platforms, it's the perfect time to offer an alternative vision of America's energy future.
\
The climate act, whose chief sponsor is California Democratic Rep. Pete Stark, would raise a whopping $2.6 trillion over the next decade, most of which would be rebated to energy users who would pay more for power that was produced with less harm to the environment. The rest of the money would go toward deficit reduction, spending that will reduce the tax burden on future generations. To prevent the tax from imposing an unfair disadvantage on American companies, the bill wisely calls for the carbon tax to be applied in tariff form to imported goods.
\
A carbon tax, compared to cap-and-trade systems like the regional compact that New Hampshire participates in, is easy to administrate. It requires minimal bureaucracy, is less easy to game and is a more direct means of reducing emissions. Emit more carbon dioxide and pay more in taxes; switch to a cleaner form of power, pay less.
\
The climate is warming and would continue to heat up if all carbon emissions were curtailed tomorrow. The question is how hot will it get and how soon. The nation, indeed the world, is engaged in a race between the technology required to produce energy without fueling climate change and the technology required to extract fossil fuels long thought too expensive to recover.
\
At the moment fossil fuel recovery technology is winning. Vast supplies of natural gas are being tapped, deep-water oil fields developed and Canada's vast supply of oil locked in tar sands extracted. The profits from the development of those energy resources will go to investors, but the added harm from global warming will be paid by everyone. A tax on carbon would recognize that harm, raise money to mitigate it, and make alternative forms of energy more competitive economically. It's a tax that's long overdue.

82,"
The three Republican candidates seeking to unseat U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, outlined divergent views on energy policy and climate change in a series of recent interviews with the Monitor.
\
Jim Rubens said he believes global warming is happening largely as a result of human activity. ""I understand there's a problem,"" he said in the interview.
\
Scott Brown, who didn't identify the cause of climate change - whether man made or natural, said ""obviously the climate is changing all the time. . . . The bottom line is we have to find a way to make sure we protect our environment.""
\
Bob Smith said he doesn't support the concept that man is causing global warming. ""The issue of warming is one thing, that it is caused by fossil fuels is another,"" he said. ""I don't think the evidence supports it.""
\
Government role in policy
\
On energy policy, Rubens and Smith said they would not support any energy subsidies and instead favor a free market. Brown said he won't discount incentives.
\
The country should strike a balance, Brown said, between creating jobs, economic policy and protecting the environment. And to get there, Brown said, his ""all of the above"" energy approach includes wind, solar, hydro, nuclear, geothermal, natural gas and some incentives.
\
""There are times when we as a society want to incentivize people for doing and taking certain actions. I don't think that is inappropriate,"" said Brown, who added that he has supported the wind production tax credits in the past and voted to end ethanol subsidies. ""Useful life is gone, got rid of that.""
\
Once incentives have become successful, Brown said it is time to pull back and look at new opportunities. ""We need to continuously adjust and adapt when it comes to our energy policy,"" he said.
\
When asked whether the oil industry should receive tax incentives, Brown said, ""Whatever we're going to do with regard to our tax policies, we need to do it without targeting and demonizing people and businesses."" He has voted to maintain them in the past.
\
Both Rubens and Smith said they don't support any government energy subsidies.
\
""They are distorting the energy markets,"" Rubens said. ""I am proposing getting rid of wind, solar, corn ethanol, nuclear, oil - all of them.""
\
Rubens, who once supported a carbon tax, said the subsidies are not price competitive and are promoting the use of old technology in the nuclear industry. ""I believe the free marketplace is at the point . . . where this stuff can't be stopped anymore,"" he said.
\
Smith said the government should get away from energy subsidies and let the free market give way to new technology. ""The competition in the private sector produces most of the successes we have had,"" he said.
\
Smith also said the country could better use its gas and oil resources. ""We have a great deal of oil and natural gas we're not drilling. . . . I believe we can do it environmentally responsibly, and we should,"" he said. ""There are national security implications . . . and big time economic implications.""
\
Brown said he also favors increasing domestic production and supports the Keystone XL Pipeline, a proposal to bring oil from Canadian tar sands to refineries in the U.S. He also said he supports expanding natural gas infrastructure and nuclear energy.
\
""It's one tool in the toolbox, it's not just nuclear power . . . we need to make sure we have other alternatives as well,"" he said.
\
Earlier this year, Brown issued a three-page white-paper on energy policy that outlines a range of other policies, including an expansion of biofuels, encouraging energy efficiency and strengthening Congress's oversight of the Environmental Protection Agency.
\
Northern Pass
\
Although not an issue that the U.S. Senate will vote on, all three candidates said they don't expect the Northern Pass project to get permitted as proposed.
\
""I don't believe it will ultimately get approved - unless they ram it through - without dropping the wires, hiding them,"" Brown said. People want the jobs and the energy, he said. ""You don't throw away the aesthetic beauty of that region to just ram it through without people being - their lives, their livelihood - being part of the solution.""
\
""If it is needed, I think it would get quickly permitted if it was 100 percent buried under I-93 and the rail bed,"" Rubens said.
\
""That is my personal view that it should be underground,"" Smith said. ""If they say otherwise, I will respect the view.""
\
The three candidates will face off in a primary Sept. 9.

Re ""Shift from fossil fuels is under way"" (Monitor editorial, Sept. 27):
\
Keep up your great work on energy, the environment and climate change! I was delighted to hear that the Monitor's editors had a meeting with representatives of wind energy companies. I hope your efforts create the political will to inspire Sens. Kelly Ayotte and Jeanne Shaheen to co-sponsor national bipartisan climate change legislation.
\
Jim Rubens, recently announced candidate for the Republican nomination to run against Shaheen in 2014 has expressed concern about climate change and his support for a carbon tax to replace income and corporate taxes. If a Republican candidate for Senate is willing to talk about his belief in climate science and the need for a market-based revenue-neutral solution to climate change that will make renewable energy even more competitive against fossil fuels, then the time is clearly ripe for New Hampshire's current senators to co-sponsor such legislation.

NextGen Climate recently called on presidential candidates to set two benchmarks for America: transitioning to 50 percent clean energy by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050.
\
For some candidates, that plan seems daunting - not because of how realistic it is to achieve (it is), how cost effective it will be (very) or how much of a difference it will make in curbing the effects of climate change (significant). Instead, an assortment of candidates are resistant because of their vested interest in fossil fuels and their stubborn refusal to accept clear scientific consensus.
\
So far, only three candidates - out of two dozen - have laid out plans to meet NextGen's benchmarks and avert the disaster of continued reliance on fossil fuels, growing our economy and saving Americans money on their energy bills in the meantime.
\
Hillary Clinton has pledged to ""generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America"" by 2027, committing to deep decarbonization by 2050. Martin O'Malley has committed to ""doubling energy efficiency"" by 2030 and ""a complete transition to renewable energy by 2050."" Bernie Sanders has proposed a carbon tax to incentivize renewables.
\
If you're looking for leaders on renewable energy, these are your candidates. Until the rest of the crowd begins to understand the importance of this issue, these candidates stand alone.
\
NextGen Climate's goal is not only a no-brainer, it's a must-do for anyone who feels like their energy is too expensive or understands the impact fossil fuels have on our environment.

85,"For the Monitor\Dear Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, Sen.-Elect Maggie Hassan, Congresswoman Ann Kuster, and Congresswoman-elect Carol Shea-Porter:\The 2016 Paris Climate Accord has laid out a clear framework from which the United States and signing nations of the world will now have to work in order to prevent any more than a 2-degree-Celsius rise in global temperature by 2100. Here are key excerpts quoted from the signed accord:\“Hold the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius”;\“To undertake rapid reductions in accordance with the best science”;\“On the basis of equity, and efforts to eradicate poverty.”\In order to stay below the 2-degree threshold (according to UK's University of Manchester Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research under the direction of Kevin Anderson) the industrialized world must be at zero emissions by 2035, and “on the basis of equity” poorer nations by 2050. This period of deep cuts in energy demand will not be permanent, but absolutely essential for the interim. (Anderson reports that any chance to keep global temperature increase below 1.5 degrees has already been lost. Since the 1990 IPCC report, the world's annual CO2 emissions are 60 percent higher today than when IPCC first warned to take action.)\This austere near-term reduction in our demand for fossil fuel energy may feel like an overwhelmingly tall order, but it's within our reach. The rapid strides and explosive growth in renewable technologies must continue in order to achieve zero CO2 emissions, but they will not alone solve our short-term dilemma.\Our remaining carbon budget (Anderson emphasizes that it's our remaining budget, rather than targets, that matters) before we reach the 2-degree limit is rapidly diminishing. The time is here for a Marshall-style mitigation plan.\An essential mechanism for emission phase-out is a steadily rising fee on fossil fuels at the wellhead and port of entry, with the total revenue (after administration costs) returned equally to each U.S. household. It's a market-based tool for cutting CO2 emissions and rapidly shifting the economy to the cheapest, most efficient clean energy sources. The market needs to be the driver. Individual and commercial energy choices and habits will only change through direct economic incentive.\I ask that you please take a careful look at upcoming 2017 legislation for a revenue-neutral carbon fee named “Carbon Fee and Dividend.” Developed by Citizen's Climate Lobby, “Carbon Fee and Dividend” is simple, transparent and incorruptible.\Studies have shown that it would positively affect our economy, environment and health, and financially benefit over 50 percent of U.S. households, including the poor, with additional benefits to everyone through conservation and cheaper clean energy choices.\CO2 mitigation is begging for courage, commitment and speedy resolve from you, our entrusted lawmakers. I truly hope that you make 2017 the year to support legislation for a revenue-neutral carbon fee, and to reach across the aisle and find common ground in order to get the job done.\Exxon Mobil has been a long-standing supporter of a revenue-neutral carbon tax. If President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state is approved, please waste not a minute in engaging Tillerson to convince our nation's lawmakers and world leaders that this method for mitigation, for which his company has expressed long-term support, is one of our best tools for achieving our commitment in accordance with the signed Paris Agreement.\Thank you for your consideration.\(Rachel Courtney lives in Dublin.)"

The tide may be turning on climate change and the public's willingness to take action. On Sunday, in the largest demonstration of its kind ever held, more than 300,000 people, among them a sizeable contingent from New Hampshire, took to the streets of New York to demand action to curb global warming.
\
On Monday, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a philanthropic organization funded with oil money, announced that it was divesting itself of investments in fossil fuel companies. Apple CEO Tim Cook, speaking at the United Nations, told leaders that acting to protect the environment does not come at the expense of economic growth. It may, in fact, foster it.
\
On Tuesday, more than 100 world leaders met at the United Nations to discuss what each nation would do to reduce man-made emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Also on Tuesday, more than 400 companies from around the globe signed onto a campaign to put a price on carbon. Imposing a tax on carbon emissions is the fastest, fairest way to combat climate change. Nations that do, and use the revenue to reduce income taxes or otherwise refund it to taxpayers, could see emissions fall, air quality and health improve, and the economy grow.
\
Yesterday, the New York Times reported that Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, announced that his company was dropping its membership in the American Legislative Exchange Council, a group backed by energy interests that lobbies against tax and regulatory action to curb global warming. People who oppose taking action, Schmidt said, ""are really hurting our children and our grandchildren and making the world a much worse place.""
\
In six weeks, New Hampshire voters will get to choose between congressional candidates who question the science behind human-induced climate change and oppose taxes or fees on carbon emissions, and candidates willing to act now before droughts grow longer, sea levels higher and hurricanes stronger. We're sorry to say that all of the candidates who oppose economic measures to address climate change - Scott Brown, Marilinda Garcia and Frank Guinta - are Republicans. Not all in their party take that position, among them Paul Volker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve; George Shultz, secretary of state under Ronald Reagan; and former South Carolina congressman Bob Inglis, who sponsored a carbon tax bill while in office.
\
The time for action on climate change is short.
\
Much of the world, including New Hampshire, is already experiencing unwelcome changes, and the effects of all the carbon dioxide already loosed on the atmosphere have yet to be felt. Each week, it seems, brings either news of another disaster that may be at least in part driven by climate change - the strongest storm ever recorded devastated the Philippines last fall, wildfires have plagued America's West all summer - or yet another doom and gloom report.
\
A study by researchers at Cornell and the University of Arizona just published in the Journal of Climate warns that coming decades could see the longest and deepest droughts in 2,000 years. Researchers put the odds of a generation-long drought in the American Southwest at between 1 in 5 and 1 in 2.
\
Some nations, including the United States thanks to executive orders issued by President Obama, are reducing carbon emissions. Among them are China, the world's major polluter. Laggards include Canada and Australia.
\
Convincing such nations to clean up their acts requires American leadership and example. That leadership will suffer if New Hampshire voters send to Congress politicians who use the economy as an excuse for inaction on climate change.

New Hampshire's 2nd Congressional District stretches from Massachusetts to Canada, and Maine to the Connecticut River. The three candidates running for the Republican nomination this year - state Rep. Marilinda Garcia of Salem, former state senator Gary Lambert of Nashua and former state representative Jim Lawrence of Hudson - have contained their conversation to several key issues.
\
Affordable Care Act
\
??Garcia: ""A lot of things have taken root at this time, so I've talked about dismantling some things that I think are more odious, such as the individual mandate, the employer mandate, the medical device tax. . . . Sure, there are some good things, the coverage for pre-existing conditions, the move to electronic medical records, and coverage for young people up to 26.""
\
??Lambert: ""I'm for repeal of the entire system, 'cause I think it's all broken. . . . There are some things we can all agree are good reforms, and repeal doesn't mean we can't do those things outside of Obamacare. I believe in the free market, I also believe there's a time and a place for government. The world is not black and white. There is some gray and that is a place where we can come to agreement on what folks want to see in health care.""
\
??Lawrence: ""I would be in favor of repealing it. The system, as imperfect as it was before, seemed to service the people of this state better than what we have now. I'd like to see more competition, to see people allowed to purchase insurance across state lines. . . . There was a small percentage of individuals that weren't being serviced correctly. We blew up the entire system for those individuals when that could be addressed without the large affordable health care options.""
\
Energy and Northern Pass
\
??Garcia said she would support Northern Pass if the lines were buried, and that the government should not ""create disincentives for people to care for the environment on their own."" She also voted to withdraw the state from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Programs like RGGI ""increase bureaucracy, increase taxes, increase rates, make it more difficult for these things to be tested in a true private market,"" she said.
\
??Lambert would consider supporting the Northern Pass project if the lines were buried. He has been attacked by his opponents for voting against withdrawing the state from RGGI, but he says he would oppose a national cap-and-trade or carbon tax program. ""What's right for New Hampshire is making sure we don't have the government picking winners and losers. If wind works for someone, that's wonderful, but I don't believe the government ought to be involved in that,"" he said.
\
??Lawrence opposes all current proposals for the Northern Pass project. He also opposed RGGI while in the House, but was absent the day in 2008 the House voted to enter the program, according to state records.
\
Job growth
\
??Garcia said on her website the role of government in promoting job growth is in ""ensuring property rights are protected, basic infrastructure is built and rule of law is enforced.""
\
??Lambert said the role of government is to ensure the success of high-tech employers offering high-paying jobs. He also believes in the need for higher education. ""I'm a big fan of the community college system,"" he said. ""Manufacturers want to see those places train people so they can go in and start working. We can help the community college system to make sure they do everything possible to succeed.""
\
??Lawrence: ""Every congressman and senator has a staff to answer their phones. They could say anything. My staff will answer the phone and say, 'Congressman Jim Lawrence's office, from New Hampshire, a great place to do business.' We need to take advantage of these free opportunities to market our state.""
\
Abortion
\
??Garcia voted while in the House to end public funding for abortions and require parental notification before a minor receives an abortion, with no exception for maternal health, victims of rape, incest or abuse. At a debate last month, she said she would support the over-the-counter sale of birth control pills. ""That would be a great move, especially as we see how Obamacare will lead to rationing, and a lack of medical providers in areas where (physicians) are already hard pressed to see all the patients seeking their attention,"" she said.
\
??Lambert, while in the Senate, supported requiring parental notification for minors seeking abortion procedures and supported a ban on partial birth abortions. He voted for an interim study on a bill that would allow employers to deny coverage for contraception based on the employer's personal beliefs, effectively helping kill that bill. He said he supports the Supreme Court's decision that closely held corporations do not have to offer employees coverage for contraception.
\
??Lawrence, while in the House, supported requiring parental notification for minors seeking abortion procedures and supported a ban on partial birth abortions.

"
88,"Monitor staff\Republican Kelly Ayotte and Democrat Maggie Hassan don't see eye to eye on most issues – including the first bill each would file if elected to the U.S. Senate.\Ayotte, the incumbent, said if she returns to Washington, she would focus on improving veterans health care and holding the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs officials accountable.\If Hassan makes it to the Senate, she said she would prioritize emergency federal funding for the drug crisis to fund treatment and recovery.\The women are facing off in one of the most competitive races in the country, which would tip party control of the U.S. Senate. Polls show the pair locked in a dead heat.\The first bill Ayotte would file in the new U.S. Senate is one to make permanent the Veterans Choice Card program, she said.\The card lets veterans get private care on the government's dime if they are stuck on long waitlists or live more than 40 miles from a VA medical center. Congress funded a pilot program after reports showed veterans languished in line for care. Ayotte's bill would also strip bonus pay from VA employees “who are guilty of misconduct.”\“When veterans return home, it's up to us to ensure they receive a hero's welcome that includes consistent support and access to timely and quality care,” said Ayotte, whose husband, Joe Daley, is an Iraq War veteran.\Hassan, a two-term governor, has watched drug deaths in the state soar. In the U.S. Senate, Hassan said she would push for emergency funding for addiction services to get dollars to treatment and recovery providers, law enforcement and prevention efforts.\The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act was signed into law this year, promising a boost in services. But a companion measure submitted by Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen for roughly $600 million in emergency funding was defeated in the Republican-led U.S. Senate. New Hampshire's drug overdose deaths have skyrocketed from 326 in 2014 to 439 last year, with a new record expected to be set in 2016.\“Emergency funding for the heroin and opioid crisis would be my first priority if elected to the United States Senate,” Hassan said in a statement.\While the candidates don't agree on all of the issues, one thing they share: Both are rising stars in their respective political parties.\Ayotte has been the state's top elected Republican since winning the U.S. Senate seat in 2010. Her name was floated as a possible vice presidential pick during the 2012 election. In Washington, she has carved a name for herself as a foreign policy hawk, often aligning with Arizona Sen. John McCain.\Hassan is the state's second female governor, elected to the post after serving six years in the state Senate, including two as the Democratic majority leader. She considers Shaheen a mentor who helped get her into politics when she was advocating for her son, Ben, who has cerebral palsy.\Independent voters will likely decide the race. As a reflection of that, both women are running to the middle. Ayotte and Hassan cast themselves as bipartisan problem solvers who can work across the aisle and aren't afraid to stand up to party leaders.\But the candidates' stances have at times angered members of their own party.\Ayotte, who is anti-abortion, raised conservatives' eyebrows when her campaign handed out free condoms to college students last month. And her decision to back a federal plan to cut carbon emissions in 2015 drew criticism from some Republican voters and the Koch-founded organization Americans for Prosperity.\Hassan, meanwhile, faced pushback from her party when she became the only Democratic governor out of more than two dozen nationwide to call for the U.S. to stop accepting Syrian refugees in wake of the Paris terror attacks.\The two face off in the final debate of the race on WMUR at 7 tonight. Here are some of the other issues:\Foreign policy \The pair's major disagreement is over the Iran nuclear deal, which lifted some sanctions on the country in exchange for new limits on its nuclear program.\Ayotte has called the deal dangerous and opposes it. She wants a reauthorization of sanctions against the country.\Hassan, like many congressional Democrats, says the agreement is “imperfect” but the best way to prevent a nuclear Iran.\Ayotte was one of 47 Senate Republicans who in 2015 signed a controversial letter warning Iranian leaders that the next president could reverse any deal the country struck.\“The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time,” read the open letter, a rare intervention by senators into diplomatic efforts. The White House accused the group of undermining foreign policy.\While Ayotte has tried to paint Hassan as weak on foreign policy, the Democrat has fended off such attacks by taking a hard-line stance on national security.\Both women oppose President Obama's plan to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, where most detainees are held without charges. Obama released the blueprint in February. It called for the transfer of about one-third of the remaining 91 detainees to other countries. The remainder, designated too dangerous for release, would be relocated to a new U.S. facility.\Hassan has called the plan too generalized, and said it doesn't take security into consideration. Ayotte said the plan could allow dangerous detainees back onto the battlefield.\The women both support additional airstrikes in Syria. Hassan said she does not support the deployment of a large-scale U.S. ground force in the country.\“It would be a mistake right now to launch another large-scale ground invasion the way we did under the Bush administration,” she said in a statement. “But we need to be constantly re-evaluating the progress on the ground and ensure that we are doing what it takes to wipe ISIS off the map and protect America's vital interests.”\Ayotte said the decision should be based on what military leaders recommend.\“The decision whether to deploy U.S. service members into harm's way is one of the most serious decisions we confront as a nation,” she said in a statement. “It is a decision I do not support lightly or hastily, and I believe it should be based on the situation on the ground, the advice of our commanders, and our national security interests.”\Guns\In the wake of mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., and Orlando, Fla., Congress has debated new restrictions on gun purchases but has taken little action.\Gun policy represents one of the biggest divides between Hassan and Ayotte, who split on whether the government should expand background checks or put restrictions on certain firearms. Currently, only licensed firearm dealers have to run checks on prospective buyers.\Hassan supports Senate Democrats' proposals to expand background checks for purchases online and at gun shows. And she has called for an “appropriate, fair assault weapons ban.” Attempts to pass such proposals have been defeated in the Republican-led U.S. Senate.\Ayotte has voted against past bills to expand background checks, saying the government should instead “fix the current system.” She supports further prosecutions of gun crimes and increasing mental health records given to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.\Federal law prohibits people committed to a mental institution from owning a gun, but it doesn't require states to submit that information to the NICS. New Hampshire is one of a handful of states that doesn't submit those records.\Both women have taken actions on gun policy that have angered some constituents.\As governor, Hassan faced criticism from Second Amendment activists when she vetoed bills to remove a state license requirement needed to carry a concealed gun.\Ayotte faced criticism in 2013, when, in wake of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, she was the only New England senator to vote against expanded background checks.\While the candidates agree the government should prevent suspected terrorists from buying guns, they're spilt on the method.\Hassan backs Democratic proposals to limit gun sales to people on the federal terrorist watch list. Ayotte joined most Senate Republicans last December to block such a proposal, but she reversed course this summer and voted for the bill. It failed to advance.\Opponents argued the list was too broad and didn't give due process protections to those affected.\Ayotte later signed onto a bipartisan bill restricting gun sales to people on the federal government's no-fly list, a smaller subset of the terror watch list made up primarily of foreign nationals. Known as “No fly, no buy,” the measure has yet to get Senate approval. \Economy\New Hampshire doesn't have its own minimum wage and instead relies on the federal rate of $7.25 an hour. Hassan favors raising the minimum wage to $12 an hour, while Ayotte thinks the best way to increase pay is by growing the economy. The federal minimum wage was last increased in 2009, from the previous $6.55 hourly rate.\The candidates also differ on tax policy, but both are proposing major reform. Ayotte supports lowering federal business taxes by dropping the corporate and individual rates.\Hassan supports expanding the child tax credit and establishing a new $1,000 tax break for middle-class families making less than $200,000. She would pay for it by cutting off tax subsidies enjoyed by major oil companies, a proposal that has been blocked in the past by Senate Republicans.\The women support different versions of a bill meant to close the gender pay gap. Hassan backs a Democratic proposal known as the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would let female workers in certain cases sue for salary discrimination.\Ayotte submitted her own plan to address pay equity last year that bars employer retaliation against workers who discuss their wages and those who decide not disclose salary history. Ayotte's bill, known as the Gender Advancement in Pay Act, doesn't go as far as the Democratic bill.\Health care \Ayotte has voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and calls it unaffordable for many New Hampshire families. She has said she wants to restore and expand health savings accounts and double flexible spending accounts, which let people save their money tax free to cover health care costs.\Hassan says the federal government should “build on the progress” of the Affordable Care Act because it has allowed people to get insurance coverage who have preexisting conditions. She supports repealing the medical device tax.\Hassan supports federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a health care and abortion provider that runs five clinics in New Hampshire. Ayotte has voted to block federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Ayotte has sponsored a bill to make birth control available without a prescription, but the legislation came under fire from Democrats who say it undermines rules that mandate insurance coverage of contraception. Ayotte disputes the claim.\Environment\Both candidates oppose a carbon tax and support the Environmental Protection Agency plan to cut carbon emissions.\Ayotte supports energy efficiency and further research into renewables, like solar power storage. She believes in an “all of the above” energy approach, which relies on renewable energy and on fossil fuels.\Ayotte, along with most Senate Republicans, supported the Keystone XL pipeline, which was rejected by Obama in 2015.\Hassan has advocated for ending federal tax subsidies for major oil companies, investing in “green-energy technology” and creating a national model rule for net metering, which lets homeowners sell their excess solar power to electric companies.\The women differ on Northern Pass, a controversial transmission line set to run through New Hampshire. Ayotte has called for full burial of the project, set to run overhead for about two-thirds of the 192-mile line. Hassan said she supports additional burial. But she thinks blasting required for undergrounding in some areas could be more environmentally damaging than putting the line overhead.\Social Securityand Medicare\Hassan pledges to fight efforts to privatize or cut Social Security, which is expected to become insolvent within 20 years. Hassan is open to adjusting the payroll tax cap so wealthier citizens pay more into the system. She hasn't been specific about how much the threshold should be raised.\Ayotte has said she supports a bipartisan solution on Social Security that maintains benefits for the retired and preserves the program for generations to come. The Republican is open to so-called means testing, or reducing benefits to high-income participants, but said she doesn't have any specific numbers in mind. She has also voiced support for adjusting the payroll tax cap, but hasn't been specific about the threshold.\(Allie Morris can be reached at 369-3307 or amorris@cmonitor.com.)"
89,"Targeted News Service\Here's a look at how members of Congress voted over the previous week.\House\Cutting Legislative Branch Spending: The House has rejected an amendment sponsored by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, to the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act (H.R. 5325). The amendment would have cut spending for programs covered by the bill by 1 percent, other than keeping funding flat for Capitol security accounts. Blackburn said the cut would put the federal government on a better track toward less spending and increased fiscal responsibility.\An amendment opponent, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat, said it “would do nothing more than hurt the service we are able to provide to our constituents” by cutting resources available for Congress to legislate wisely.\ The vote, on June 10, was 165 yeas to 237 nays.\Voting yes: Frank Guinta, a Republican\Voting no: Annie Kuster, a Democrat\Legislative Branch Spending: The House has passed the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act (H.R. 5325), sponsored by Rep. Tom Graves, a Georgia Republican. The bill would provide $3.481 billion of funding for fiscal 2017 programs in the federal government's legislative branch, including the Capitol building, but not including the Senate. Graves said it curbed wasteful spending by making tough budgetary choices while continuing to “preserve the beauty, enhance the security, and improve the institutions of the United States Capitol complex.”\A bill opponent, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat, questioned its $32.5 million increase in funding for the Capitol's police force and said its $107.9 million to fund the Congressional Research Service was insufficient.\The vote, on June 10, was 233 yeas to 175 nays.\Voting no: Guinta, Kuster\Carbon Tax: The House has passed a resolution (H. Con. Res. 89), sponsored by Rep. Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, expressing the sense of Congress that a tax on carbon dioxide emissions would harm the U.S. economy. Scalise said the tax would have no impact on global CO2 levels while costing more than a million U.S. jobs and increasing costs for consumers, especially low-income people.\A resolution opponent, Rep. Sander M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat, said “the scientific evidence of climate change is overwhelming, and the consensus is clear” that CO2 emissions are linked to harmful impacts from climate change, such as more intense hurricanes.\The vote, on June 10, was 237 yeas to 163 nays.\Voting yes: Guinta\Voting no: Kuster\Oil Production Tax: The House has passed a resolution (H. Con. Res. 112), sponsored by Rep. Charles W. Boustany Jr., a Louisiana Republican, expressing the sense of Congress in opposition to President Obama's proposed $10 per barrel excise tax on crude oil production in the U.S. Boustany said the tax “would not only add significantly to the cost of a gallon of gasoline at the pump, certainly disproportionately hurting fixed-income families, seniors, and so forth, it would also have a detrimental impact on job creation, on wages, and on the Nation's overall economic health.”\A resolution opponent, Rep. Sander M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat, said it was based on a Republican denial of climate change and the role of oil and other fossil fuels in causing global warming, and blocking the tax would impair the country's ability to combat the climate change threat.\The vote, on June 10, was 253 yeas to 144 nays.\Voting yes: Guinta, Kuster\Relations with Caribbean Nations: The House has passed the United States-Caribbean Strategic Engagement Act (H.R. 4939), sponsored by Rep. Eliot L. Engel, a New York Democrat. The bill would require a State Department report to Congress outlining a strategy for U.S. policy toward Caribbean nations, including improving the region's public safety and its economy. Engel said the bill would improve U.S. diplomatic and economic engagement with the strategically important Caribbean by adopting new policies.\The vote, on Monday, was 386 yeas to 6 nays.\Voting yes: Guinta, Kuster\Government Networking and IT Research: The House has passed the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act (H.R. 5312), sponsored by Rep. Darin LaHood, an Illinois Republican. The bill would rename the National High-Performance Computing Program as the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program, and charge the renamed program with researching cybersecurity, human-computer interactions, big data, and the use of data analytics to integrate city-scale information technology and physical infrastructures. LaHood said information technology developed by the program “bolsters economic competitiveness and creates new industries and businesses; it helps ensure future national security, including cybersecurity; and creates the good-paying jobs we need for today and tomorrow.”\The vote, on Monday, was 385 yeas to 7 nays.\Voting yes: Guinta, Kuster\Scientific Research Facilities: The House has passed the National Science Foundation Major Research Facility Reform Act (H.R. 5049), sponsored by Rep. Barry Loudermilk, a Georgia Republican. The bill would change the role of the Large Facilities Office at the National Science Foundation, with the goal of improving the NSF's management of large research buildings. Loudermilk said reforming the Office to improve oversight of facility construction and management of the NSF should reduce waste and time and cost overruns at the agency.\The vote, on Tuesday, was 412 yeas to 9 nays.\Voting yes: Guinta, Kuster\Tax-Exempt Groups and the IRS: The House has passed the Preventing IRS Abuse and Protecting Free Speech Act (H.R. 5053), sponsored by Rep. Peter J. Roskam, an Illinois Republican. The bill would bar the Internal Revenue Service from requiring tax-exempt organizations to provide information identifying their contributors in their annual tax returns. Roskam said the IRS has stated that it does not need to identify contributors in order to review filings by the organizations, and that the IRS has shown a tendency to illegitimately leak contributor information with resulting harassment of the contributors by hostile groups.\A bill opponent, Rep. Sander M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat, said keeping contributor information from the IRS “removes the last safeguard against foreign governments and foreign individuals from influencing our elections.”\ The vote, on Tuesday, was 240 yeas to 182 nays.\Voting yes: Guinta\Voting no: Kuster\Military Climate Change Directive: The House has passed an amendment sponsored by Rep. Ken Buck, a Colorado Republican, to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 5293). The amendment would bar funding for implementation of the Defense Department's directive on climate change adaptation and resilience. Buck said the directive, by forcing military officials to prioritize climate change over measures to combat U.S. enemies, would distract the military from its ultimate purpose of protecting national security.\ An amendment opponent, Rep. Peter J. Visclosky, an Indiana Democrat, said it would hamstring the military's capacity to account for problems created by climate change and a changing global environment.\The vote, on Thursday, was 216 yeas to 205 nays.\Voting yes: Guinta\Voting no: Kuster\Military Bases and Alien Children: The House has passed an amendment sponsored by Rep. Bradley Byrne, an Alabama Republican, to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 5293). The amendment would bar funding for building facilities on military bases to provide temporary housing for unaccompanied alien children. Byrne said “it simply makes no sense for these individuals to be held at military installations” that often lack basic infrastructure such as sewage facilities or are near live artillery ranges and active airfields.\An amendment opponent, Rep. Peter J. Visclosky, an Indiana Democrat, said the military should be allowed to use domestic bases “to provide the same type of humanitarian assistance to minor children that we do in the Philippines, Pakistan, Japan, Bangladesh, and Haiti.”\The vote, on Thursday, was 223 yeas to 198 nays.\Voting yes: Guinta\Voting no: Kuster\Detaining Enemy Combatants Domestically: The House has passed an amendment sponsored by Rep. Doug Lamborn, a Colorado Republican, to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 5293). The amendment would bar funding for surveying and other initiatives related to the potential use of locations within the U.S. to detain enemy combatants now held at the Guantanamo Bay facility in Cuba. Lamborn said “it is against the law for the terrorists held at Guantanamo to be brought to the United States,” so Congress should provide no funding toward that purpose.\An amendment opponent, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, said replacing Guantanamo Bay would save many millions of dollars while improving national security by removing a propaganda tool for terrorist groups.\The vote, on Thursday, was 245 yeas to 175 nays.\Voting yes: Guinta\Voting no: Kuster\Warrantless Database Searches: The House has rejected an amendment sponsored by Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 5293). The amendment would have barred funding for the federal government to use a foreign intelligence database to conduct searches for information about U.S. citizens. Massie said the ban would maintain the Fourth Amendment protection against warrantless searches of Americans, without hampering the ability of intelligence agencies to detect external threats to the country.\ An amendment opponent, Rep. Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, a New Jersey Republican, said the ban, by impeding the government's ability to locate information about threats, “would put a lot more American lives at risk both at home and abroad.”\The vote, on Thursday, was 198 yeas to 222 nays.\Voting yes: Guinta, Kuster\Green Energy and the Military: The House has passed an amendment sponsored by Rep. Tom McClintock, a California Republican, to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 5293). The amendment would bar funding for Defense Department efforts to meet various green energy mandates set out in law and by the president. McClintock said the mandates “require the military to squander billions of dollars on so-called green energy” that is expensive and wasteful of scarce military resources.\An amendment opponent, Rep. Peter J. Visclosky, an Indiana Democrat, said it would block a wide range of sensible military initiatives, including portable solar power for soldiers in combat.\The vote, on Thursday, was 221 yeas to 197 nays.\Voting yes: Guinta\Voting no: Kuster\Afghanistan Infrastructure Spending: The House has passed an amendment sponsored by Rep. Tim Walberg, a Michigan Republican, to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 5293). The amendment would bar funding for projects under the military's Afghanistan infrastructure fund. Walberg said the infrastructure fund was poorly run, wasteful and lacked adequate oversight, and needed no further funding from Congress.\An amendment opponent, Rep. Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, a New Jersey Republican, said the ban would leave many large electric power projects in Afghanistan unfinished, disrupting efforts to provide basic necessary infrastructure to the nation and improve its security.\The vote, on Thursday, was 218 yeas to 201 nays.\Voting yes: Guinta\Voting no: Kuster\ Military Spending in 2017: The House has passed the Department of Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 5293), sponsored by Rep. Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, a New Jersey Republican. The bill would fund $575.8 billion of fiscal 2017 military spending by the Defense Department, including $58.6 billion for combat operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other overseas countries. Frelinghuysen said it “wisely invests more money for our troops, more training for our troops, more modern equipment, expanded cybersecurity, more intelligence-gathering capabilities, and better healthcare outcomes for our troops and their families.”\A bill opponent, Rep. Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat, faulted it for failing to provide funding after April of 2017, saying that it “recklessly endangers our servicemembers by severely restricting the financial stability, certainty, and budgeting predictability that commanders need to plan beyond next April.”\The vote, on Thursday, was 282 yeas to 138 nays.\Voting yes: Guinta, Kuster\Campaigns to Counter Terrorism: The House has passed the Countering Terrorist Radicalization Act (H.R. 5471), sponsored by Rep. Michael T. McCaul, a Texas Republican. The bill would authorize initiatives at the Homeland Security Department to counter violent extremism through public education, intelligence and other measures. McCaul said that increasing the use of testimonials from former members of the Islamic State group (ISIS) was among the measures the bill advanced “to help communities spot signs of violent radicalization and to actively combat the propaganda of terrorist groups like ISIS.”\The vote, on Thursday, was 402 yeas to 15 nays.\Voting yes: Guinta, Kuster\Senate\Military Spending Authorization: The Senate has passed the National Defense Authorization Act (S. 2943), sponsored by Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican. The bill would authorize $603.9 billion of fiscal 2017 spending on the military, military construction programs, and the Energy Department's military programs, and set out personnel levels for the various branches of the military. McCain said it would reform the military and give it a greater capability to fight radical terrorist Islam both domestically and overseas.\A bill opponent, Sen. Kirsten E. Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, criticized it for insufficient measures to address rape and other sexual crimes within the military.\ The vote, on Tuesday, was 85 yeas to 13 nays.\Voting yes: Kelly Ayotte, a Republican\Voting no: Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat\Funding Counter-Opioid Measures: The Senate has agreed to a motion sponsored by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, to instruct conferees with the House on negotiating the two chambers' versions of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (S. 524). The motion insisted that the bill's conference report include provisions funding prevention, treatment and recovery programs by state and local governments to combat heroin and opioid abuse. Shaheen said “the opioid crisis is a national public health emergency, and it is long past time that Congress treat it like one” by adequately funding anti-opioid measures.\The vote, on Thursday, was 66 yeas to 29 nays.\Voting yes: Ayotte, Shaheen\Negotiating Versions of Opioid Abuse Bill: The Senate has agreed to a motion sponsored by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, to instruct conferees with the House on negotiating the two chambers' versions of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (S. 524). The motion insisted that the bill's conference report establish a single grant program for efforts related to opioid abuse and that it address the unique concerns of rural areas impacted by opioid abuse, among other provisions. Whitehouse said the measures sought to improve the bill and “focus on the rural communities for which opioid has been a plague.”\ The vote, on Thursday, was 70 yeas to 24 nays.\Voting yes: Ayotte, Shaheen\Along with roll call votes this week, the Senate also passed the Federal Law Enforcement Self-Defense and Protection Act (H.R. 2137), to ensure federal law enforcement officers can ensure their own safety, and the safety of their families, during a covered furlough; passed the Indian Trust Asset Reform Act (H.R. 812), to reform management of Indian trust assets; passed a resolution (S. Res. 496), condemning the terrorist attack on the Pulse Orlando nightclub; and passed the Rapid DNA Act (S. 2348), to implement the use of Rapid DNA instruments in the judiciary system.\\The House also passed the FOIA Improvement Act (S. 337), to improve the Freedom of Information Act; passed the Oversee Visa Integrity with Stakeholder Advisories Act (H.R. 3636), to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow labor organizations and management organizations to receive the results of visa petitions about which such organizations have submitted advisory opinions; passed the Strategy To Oppose Predatory Organ Trafficking Act (H.R. 3694), to combat trafficking in human organs; and passed a resolution (H. Res. 343), expressing concern regarding persistent and credible reports of systematic, state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in China.\\\"
90,"For the Monitor\I am inspired by the incredible energy and enthusiasm of people across our country – especially young people – who are standing up to demand progress on climate change.\2019 has brought with it troubling reminders of how our climate is changing. The continental United States is on track to have the wettest year ever recorded – from January to August, it has seen more rainfall than ever before during that period.\Last month, Greenland's ice sheet lost 12.5 billion tons of ice in one day alone. The difficult realities of climate change only become more and more stark every day.\As a member of the Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, I am committed to taking action in Congress to protect our climate and planet for our children and future generations.\During the August district work period, I heard from many people across New Hampshire who are concerned about this critical issue. Granite State farmers shared how climate change is already impacting our state's $1.5 billion agriculture industry.\At the renowned Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest research center and the University of New Hampshire Cooperative Extension office in Lancaster, I spoke with local experts about how New Hampshire's forests are threatened by the symptoms of climate change – from the rise of invasive species like the emerald ash borer to the loss of snowpack that kept root systems insulated during the winter months.\Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to visit Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming with other members of Congress to hear from top National Park Service scientists about how climate change will forever alter our iconic public lands. Although separated by 2,000 miles, I was struck by how the climate challenges facing Yellowstone mirror what we face at home in New Hampshire.\In the Granite State, we are already seeing climate change disrupting our way of life – from shorter winters that undermine our snow sports industry to the rise in ticks that are killing our moose population. Unless we act, these situations will only worsen.\That is why I am pleased to help advance critical legislation in the House of Representatives that will address and mitigate the threat to our climate.\Last week, the House passed common-sense legislation to prohibit oil and gas drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as well as on our coasts along the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. The transition to clean, renewable energy is a win-win for our economy and environment; there is no reason to double down on outdated and polluting sources of energy.\Polling data backs this up. More and more Americans are recognizing the tremendous threat of climate change and embracing clean energy policies that will protect our climate and bring new energy jobs to our communities.\We can save our planet, create jobs and reduce costs simultaneously!\In Washington, I am advancing a clean energy agenda to make this goal a reality. That includes the Clean Energy Standard Act. This legislation will push electric companies to bring more clean energy into the grid to help spur our nation's transition to 100% renewable energy by mid-century. I recently co-sponsored Rep. Peter Welch's Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, which incentivizes the use of energy-efficient technologies that quickly pay for themselves.\When we as consumers have information about how new efficient technologies can reduce our energy use and help our pocketbooks, we make smarter choices. This bill also mandates that the federal government, the single largest consumer of energy in our nation, embrace these common-sense technologies to reduce its energy footprint and save the taxpayers' hard-earned money.\Congress must lead, and I implore Senate Majority Leader McConnell and President Trump to work with us to save our planet. Climate scientists and clean energy advocates, from New Hampshire to Yellowstone, continue to inspire me and affirm my work to develop solutions in Washington.\It is not too late to take steps to mitigate the impact of climate change, but we must take meaningful action now.\(Ann McLane Kuster represents the 2nd Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.)"

Alternative energy, not a gas tax, is the answer
\
There has been debate on whether a gas tax would slow gas consumption. While taxes have been effective in limiting consumption of some products, the prime example being tobacco, they would not be in this case.
\
Americans have shown that gas price increases do little to lower demand. After Hurricane Katrina, gas prices spiked to over $3 per gallon, an increase of nearly 25 percent, yet no significant drop in consumption was felt. Americans continued to commute and go about their lives as if nothing had happened.
\
This spike was not without consequence. Discretionary income dropped, as did consumer spending. Consumer products rose in price because of increased energy and transportation costs.
\
A gasoline tax increase will do nothing but inflate an already unstable price, causing a further drag on our economy. If we truly want to reduce consumption of foreign oil, we need to change how we approach the problem.
\
Improve fuel efficiency for all vehicles. Expand and improve public transportation. And, especially, find alternatives to oil.
\
Hydrogen seems to be the most logical alternative. Hydrogen engines expel water, not carbon dioxide, as a byproduct, causing no harm to the environment.
\
Switching to hydrogen would cost billions of dollars. But then we have spent $400 billion to stop the proliferation of WMDs (protect our oil interests). Conversion to hydrogen will create thousands of jobs. The result will be a stronger, energy-independent nation leading the world in the right direction.
\
We are coming to a crossroads in our history. What we do now will decide whether we continue to be a world leader or fall by the wayside. The choice is ours.

For three decades our truck-driving tour guide has moved eggs - a million a day - from Monroe to all parts of the country. This is a fragile undertaking over rough roads, but he is nothing but spare, frank and straight with his words. The roads, he said, are a real ""pisser,"" (pronounced piss'ah).
\
Last week, Transportation Commissioner Chris Clement and I toured North Country roads in an egg truck and later an ambulance in Lancaster.
\
Crowded in the back of the ambulance, the paramedic explained the delicate challenge of attaching an IV while traversing the bumps around a section of town called ""Lost Nation.""
\
None of this is new, of course. Our state transportation system, including numbered highways, quiet byways and bridges, are in bad shape. It's been 21 years since the state gas tax has been raised. Back in 1991, legislators were reimbursed at the federal per mile rate of 27.5 cents for their trips to Concord; now that rate is 56.5 cents, more than twice as much. This jump is nothing compared to the price of salt, asphalt, gravel and cement.
\
I'm reluctant to support tax increases. I recently led the fight to sink the boat tax. Last year I opposed a much larger increase in the gas tax and opposed another one when I was in the House in 1989. But I'm no ideologue; I pride myself on being the most practical and independent member of the Senate. I work with whoever shows up to stabilize our fragile economy and over-burdened communities. The Department of Transportation is at a fiscal cliff and needs to avoid big layoffs (135 people are employed in my district alone) and a continued decline in infrastructure.
\
I'm proud to join a group of Republican senators who have proposed a modest 4.5-cent increase in the gas tax. It's being touted as a user fee and aims to regain some of the purchasing power that the DOT has lost over the past two decades.
\
This tiny increase will hardly be noticed at the pump where prices regularly fluctuate - as witnessed in Vermont and Maine where their gas tax is higher, but retail prices are nearly identical.
\
Good roads are essential to a successful rural economy, especially in a region that relies on tourism and a workforce required commute long distances. More than 20 percent of the state's roads are in my North Country district - a place burdened by isolation, poverty and harsh climate and environment. It is hard to get anywhere in the North Country without using a state road.
\
The need is obvious and so is the solution.

Meeting last night in their only scheduled televised debate, Gov. John Lynch and Republican challenger Jim Coburn sounded familiar notes from their campaigns. Lynch touted his bipartisan style and focused on his service and plans for a second term. Coburn attacked Lynch for a ""lack of leadership"" and accused the Democrat of putting the state on course for an income tax through inaction.
\
Lynch repeated his frequent vow to veto any sales or income tax. He said he helped turn a $300 million deficit into a surplus while still investing in children's health insurance, the environment, and travel and tourism. Given a second term, Lynch said that he would work to make health care more accessible and affordable, attract jobs to the state and expand educational opportunities.
\
Coburn challenged Lynch's budget claims repeatedly, accusing him of overstating the deficit and taking credit for the work of Republican lawmakers and the previous Republican governor, Craig Benson, whom Lynch defeated in 2004. Coburn said Lynch's failure to resolve the long-running debate over school funding had yielded a crisis. Coburn said a recent Supreme Court decision on education had made the upcoming Nov. 7 election one of the most important in 30 years, warning again that a second term for Lynch would lead to a state income tax.
\
That prompted one of the debate panelists, New Hampshire Union Leader reporter John DiStaso, to ask Coburn if he doubted Lynch's trustworthiness, given the governor's frequently stated opposition to an income tax.
\
Coburn, a first-term state representative from Windham, stumbled with his answer, appearing to forget the question. He said Lynch missed a leadership opportunity by failing to push for a constitutional amendment to overrule the Supreme Court. Then he slowed: ""We in this state need to - to take the steps to, I - I've lost my place. Could you repeat the question again?""
\
Asked again, Coburn said he thought Lynch was truthful in his opposition to the income tax but could have his veto overruled by a two-thirds majority of the Legislature, should voters on Nov. 7 elect a wave of Democrats to the House and Senate. Republicans currently hold sizable majorities in both bodies.
\
Coburn and Lynch have similar ideas about how to pay for education - both support targeting aid to needy communities and want to end the statewide property tax - but diverge when it comes to the role of the Supreme Court, which last month ordered lawmakers to come up with a constitutional definition of an adequate education by the end of June. If not, the court may impose a definition of its own.
\
Coburn wants to amend the state constitution to eliminate the court's ability to rule on funding plans written by the Legislature or governor. Lynch opposes that idea but said he would consider a ""narrow constitutional amendment"" to protect a targeted-aid plan, so long as that amendment ensured that the state provided a certain amount of money to local districts.
\
Coburn said the judges erred. He called his amendment ""a small clarification to the constitution"" that would prevent the judicial system from forcing lawmakers to accept an income tax, and he faulted Lynch for not supporting that amendment when the Legislature met for a special session last month.
\
Lynch said such an amendment would have been hasty. ""The notion that 424 representatives and senators would come together in the middle of an election cycle and with little opportunity for debate or discussion or dialogue solve education funding - which has been an issue here in New Hampshire going back to 1789 - is preposterous,"" Lynch said, prescribing a 2007 plan to ""roll up our sleeves"" and ""work in a bipartisan way"" to address the issue.
\
Lynch also said Coburn's amendment would have allowed the state to ""walk away from its responsibility for public education"" by eliminating funding in a tough budget year, thus pushing the entire burden to local taxpayers.
\
That was as close as Lynch came to an attack, save for a quip about confusion over where Coburn stood on the gas tax. (Coburn proposed reducing the gas tax to boost the economy last summer but has also advocated raising the gas tax in the future, to wean motorists from fossil-fuel consumption.) Given a chance to ask three questions of Coburn, Lynch twice spoke about popular proposals of his own - to crack down on sex offenders and to make college more affordable - and asked Coburn how he felt about them.
\
Coburn, in contrast, challenged Lynch at each opportunity. He asked Lynch how he could justify past campaign contributions to ""pro- liberal"" candidates such as Arnie Arnesen and Mark Fernald, quizzed him about his deficit-erasing claims, and asked him again why voters should believe Lynch would provide the leadership needed to keep the courts from deciding the school-funding question on their own.
\
Lynch, 53, and Coburn, 62, exhibited several philosophical differences. Coburn said he wants to amend the constitution to limit marriage to ""the holy union"" of one man and one woman. Lynch said he opposes gay marriage but believes the constitution should not be amended to enshrine discrimination. He also said he supported benefits for same-sex couples when he was a trustee of the University of New Hampshire, and he would work to include same-sex partner benefits in the next state-employee contract.
\
Lynch also affirmed his support for abortion rights, while Coburn didn't answer directly a question about whether his own opposition to abortion could include room for allowing abortion in cases or rape or incest or if the pregnancy threatened the life of the mother. He answered by speaking of his support for parental notification whenever children have abortions or obtain emergency contraception, so long as they remain legal.
\
At one point, Lynch was asked to respond to criticism that he only adopts popular positions by citing scenarios where he'd made a principled but unpopular decision. He cited his push to raise the school-attendance age and his call for mandatory prison sentences for sex offenders and child abusers.
\
Coburn said Lynch was an uninspired governor. ""If we had to give a title to John Lynch's term in office, it wouldn't be Profiles in Courage. It might more appropriately be called . . . The Safe Road Taken,"" he said.
\
Lynch said he has worked hard to be a bipartisan leader. ""And with your support, I will continue to bring the leadership necessary to focus on results,"" he said.

In their first debate yesterday, Gov. John Lynch and Republican challenger Jim Coburn took vastly different approaches. Coburn tried to go after Lynch directly, criticizing his leadership and accusing him of failing to keep campaign promises. Lynch largely avoided head- to-head confrontation and focused instead on his experience and commitment to bipartisanship.
\
Coburn repeatedly called Lynch by name, with lines such as ""John Lynch is doing nothing"" and ""Governor Lynch just doesn't get it."" Coburn, a first-term state representative, suggested Lynch lacked ""the courage to fight for what is right"" - a trait Coburn said he himself could provide.
\
Lynch, who has achieved unprecedented statewide approval ratings, shared the stage with Coburn but never mentioned him by name, though he made occasional references to ""my opponent."" During the nearly hour-long debate, Lynch concentrated on speaking to the crowd about his achievements as governor and his goals for a second term.
\
The Hopkinton Democrat cited several accomplishments from his first term: working with the Legislature to erase a $300 million deficit and put $50 million into the state's rainy-day fund, enacting tougher penalties against sexual predators, expanding children's health insurance, freezing community-college tuition rates, and investing in the travel-and-tourism economy.
\
""We've shown in the last two years what we can accomplish when we put partisan politics to one side and just work together, focusing on results,"" Lynch said.
\
If elected to a second term, Lynch said, he would work on increasing the high school graduation rate, expanding the amount of renewable energy produced in-state, and making health care more affordable and accessible for small businesses and families. He also said he would work with the Legislature to respond to the recent Supreme Court ruling on education funding, which ordered lawmakers to define an adequate education by the end of June.
\
The candidates will have a televised debate later this month. Yesterday's debate, which was not televised, was staged at the Center of New Hampshire by the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce. Lynch and Coburn gave prepared opening and closing statements and answered questions from a panel of business and political leaders. With each question, the candidates were given the chance for rebuttal.
\
Coburn, a lawmaker from Windham, said Lynch stood on the same stage two years ago and promised to reduce health-care costs, eliminate the statewide property tax and resolve the education- funding crisis. He failed on all three, Coburn said.
\
With education funding, Coburn said, ""not only didn't he fix it, but we are in worse shape today than we were the day John Lynch took office.""
\
Coburn said the state needs a constitutional amendment ""so we can get the courts out of the Legislature's way and move us away from the debate of an adequate education and on to the important task at hand of providing a quality education"" - which he said should be determined by lawmakers and the governor. He said Lynch's reluctance to back that type of an amendment could force the state to adopt an income or sales tax.
\
""The threat of a sales or income tax is real, and John Lynch is doing nothing to stop it,"" he said. ""Let me repeat that: John Lynch is doing nothing to stop it.""
\
Lynch said the state would never adopt a sales or income tax under his watch. He said he wanted to approach education funding next session by returning to the plan he proposed in 2005 - to target aid to economically needy and academically under-performing districts and to do away with the statewide property tax. The Republican-controlled Legislature passed over that plan for one that kept a reduced statewide property tax but did away with donor towns.
\
Lynch said his old plan, which initially had bipartisan support, could serve as a ""good starting point"" for the discussion. He said he might also be open to a ""narrow constitutional amendment,"" so long as it committed the state to providing a ""quality education"" and not relinquishing its funding responsibility.
\
Among other challenges, Coburn said Lynch was taking undue credit for balancing the budget. He said Lynch benefited from higher-than- anticipated revenue and budget cuts made by Republican lawmakers. He also accused Lynch of failing to guard New Hampshire's first-in-the- nation primary. The Democratic National Committee recently adopted a calendar for 2008 that would insert a Nevada caucus between the leadoff Iowa caucus and the ensuing New Hampshire primary, then place a South Carolina primary immediately after New Hampshire. (New Hampshire officials may choose to ignore that calendar and hold the primary earlier, against DNC wishes.)
\
""Where is the leadership when this first-in-the-nation primary status was threatened?"" Coburn asked. ""I saw more leadership from (state Democratic Party Chairwoman) Kathy Sullivan than I did from the governor on this issue.""
\
Coburn said he had called Republican leaders across the country and received assurances that his party was not trying to usurp New Hampshire's primary standing.
\
Lynch said he had defended the New Hampshire primary as the home of retail politics, a bastion of tough questions and human-scale campaigning in an era of ""rope lines and TV cameras"" elsewhere. Lynch said he had secured written assurances from 10 potential Democratic presidential candidates that they would campaign in New Hampshire no matter when the primary was scheduled, regardless of DNC wishes.
\
Lynch took a direct-attack approach once, when he questioned Coburn's past statements on the gas tax. ""Frankly, I can't keep up with my opponent on this one,"" said Lynch, who said Coburn had issued mixed messages about wanting to both raise and lower the gas tax. The tax - 18.3 cents a gallon, the lowest in New England - goes toward highway projects. Eliminating it could jeopardize the state's infrastructure, Lynch said. On the other hand, raising it would hurt working families, Lynch said.
\
""It's an area where I really don't understand how he's been able to move back and forth, and it's been difficult to follow him on that,"" Lynch said.
\
Lynch has targeted Coburn as a gas-tax flip-flopper in a campaign ad, and the Democratic Party has issued multiple news releases and launched a website about the subject. Coburn seemed exasperated about the issue. He said his comments have been straightforward: He wanted to lower the gas tax temporarily to help people save money and attract tourists, but he would consider raising it in the future as a means of weaning people from fossil-fuel dependence to help the environment.
\
""Are there really that many people in the room who are confused by my position on the gas tax?"" Coburn said. ""I hope not.""

Gas stations across the state will be getting a lot of traffic from SUVs and trucks this weekend, as vacationers fill up their tanks during the Labor Day holiday.
\
But in between the pumps there are fewer hybrid cars, which can drive much farther on a single tank of gas.
\
It's a concerning prospect to lawmakers who manage the state budget because every gallon of gas drivers pump into their vehicles helps pay to maintain the state's roads and bridges.
\
The state's gas tax - at 22.2 cents a gallon - is funneled into the highway fund, money that helps pay for road and bridges, municipal aid and operations at the Department of Transportation.
\
But within the next 10 years, the highway fund is projected to amass a major cumulative deficit, DOT officials have said.
\
And adding to that bleak picture is the fact that gas tax revenues are plateauing as vehicles increasingly become more fuel efficient. It's a trend officials expect only to accelerate, as more people switch to alternative fuel vehicles that use less or no gas at all.
\
""More and more people are either driving electric vehicles or using hybrids, which is great for the environment, great for fuel economy, but it's not so great for our roads and bridges,"" said Democratic Rep. John Cloutier, of Claremont. ""In 10 to 20 years, it's going to be a major problem.""
\
So this fall, a small group of lawmakers is meeting to try and come up with a way to fairly tax all vehicles, including hybrids and electric vehicles, that use the state's roads.
\
Politically, it's not a popular prospect. Recent proposals to raise the gas tax or vehicle registration fees, have faced intense criticism from Republicans, who currently control both Legislative chambers. But even so, it looks like this year there will be another push to raise money for the highway fund.
\
Republican Rep. Norm Major, a member of the study group and chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means committee that looks after state revenue, has already filed a bill to create a new road usage fee. The fee would be paid in addition to the gas tax and be calculated in relation to each vehicle's fuel efficiency. He will present the plan at the study committee's next meeting Friday.
\
""If you're going to use the roads, you need to support the upkeep,"" said Major, of Plaistow.
\
While transportation funding may be a pressing legislative challenge that many lawmakers recognize, it's also a controversial one, even when a plan has GOP backing.
\
A proposal to raise the state gas tax by 4.2 cents in 2014 - the first increase since 1991 - was a knock-out legislative fight that pitted Republican against Republican. The increase passed, but it came back to haunt some supportive Republicans in that year's election, when they faced primary challengers critical of their vote. Of note, both Republican senators who co-sponsored the gas tax increase won their bids for re-election.
\
It doesn't mean lawmakers aren't receptive to any increases. Last winter, a small contingent of Republican House budget writers floated a plan to raise the gas tax again, by roughly 7 cents, to help close a gap in the transportation budget. But it didn't go far - the plan was shot down before it was ever brought to the House floor.
\
While roads, bridges and transportation funding may not be the sexiest issues, they are ones that constituents notice.
\
Over in Bow, residents on Birchdale Road may be waiting years before they can cross a local bridge that was closed this summer after it was deemed unsafe.
\
It's because the project isn't slated to get state bridge aid - money generated by the gas tax - until 2025.
\
Kuster challenger?
\
While most political speculation these days is spent on the U.S. Senate race and whether Gov. Maggie Hassan will jump in, Republicans are starting to chatter about potential candidates to run against U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster, a Democrat who says she'll seek a third term in 2016.
\
Some names include Senate President Chuck Morse, House Majority Leader Jack Flanagan and Gary Lambert, a former state senator who ran in 2014 for the seat, but lost the Republican primary.
\
Both Morse and Flanagan say they have been approached, but neither is committed.
\
It's something Morse says he's been interested in.
\
""I won't rule anything out at this point,"" said the Salem Republican. ""Right now, realistically, I have to worry about the Senate.""
\
Flanagan echoed that sentiment.
\
""I haven't said no, and I haven't said yes,"" he said. ""I have been approached by a number of people, and I am very flattered. Right now we have a budget thing.""
\
Lambert said he's considering it, but said he doesn't know if 2016 is the right year.
\
""If you've done it once, you always consider doing it again,"" he said. ""I can't say I've made a decision either way.""
\
Some Republicans say Kuster's seat is ripe for a challenge. But until a clear-cut candidate emerges to take Kuster on, she's in the clear.
\
""Everyday there's not a candidate is a day that Annie Kuster doesn't have to spend money, she doesn't have to spend resources pushing back against a potential Republican challenger,"" said Wayne Lesperance, a professor of political science at New England College.
\
Kuster has been known for fundraising abilities. And she handily defeated Republican challenger Marilinda Garcia in the 2014 election to win her second term.
\
There's still time until the 2016 race. But it's ticking.
\
Moving shop
\
New Hampshire is a hostile environment for marijuana policy. At least that's according to Matt Simon, the New England political director for the Marijuana Policy Project.
\
In search of more fertile ground, he's moving shop to Vermont for the upcoming legislative session, where he expects marijuana legalization will be a top issue.
\
""We're not abandoning New Hampshire, we're just being realistic about next year,"" he said. ""We have a governor who has been hostile to everything we're trying to do.""
\
The House passed a bill this year to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana, but it was narrowly defeated in the Senate after a deal to get it through fell apart on the floor.
\
The ""Live Free or Die"" state is the only one in New England that has not lessened the penalties for marijuana possession, a point Simon is quick to point out.
\
While the House has passed several bills to decriminalize and even legalize and regulate marijuana, they have always died in the Senate. The big victory for advocates came in 2013, when the state legalized medicinal use of marijuana. But even then, in the years since, the roll out to patients has been slow, Simon says.
\
Simon has been based in New Hampshire in 2007. He now plans to move to Montpelier and commute down to New Hampshire for marijuana policy hearings or special occasions. Simon sent an email to lawmakers last Thursday, breaking the news about the move and telling them he looks forward to the 2016 election, linking to a poll that shows residents overwhelmingly support decriminalization and legalization of marijuana.
\
""I look forward to being a part of this when it finally happens,"" he wrote.
\
Papal visit
\
When Pope Francis makes his long-awaited visit to the U.S., Penacook Rep. Steve Shurtleff will be there to greet him.
\
Shurteff was invited to join President Obama at the White House to officially welcome the Pope to America after he arrives on Sept. 22.
\
Even Shurtleff seemed a little mystified about the invite.
\
""The question in the State House will be, 'Why Shurtleff?' "" he said laughing, and then attempted an answer. ""I don't know, I'm Catholic.""

98,"City Plaza: Concord sees plenty of fans of the technology.\CONCORD ""This is the future,"" Jerry Curran declared, beaming at his BMW i3 like a proud parent.\The 5th annual National Drive Electric Week celebration drew Curran and other electric vehicle aficionados to the State House plaza Saturday.\It was one of more than 200 such events across the country meant to draw attention to the environmental and economic benefits of plug-in electric vehicles (EVs).\Curran, who lives in Weare, is chairman of the New Hampshire Sierra Club, one of the organizers of the event. He sees these new electric vehicles as ""the next step of the evolution of the car.""\And he said the new models quickly blow away the old stereotypes. ""If you drive one of these, you would never drive a gas car again,"" he said. ""It's faster than any car you'll ever see off the stop.""\Curran, a retired airline pilot, said sometimes he can't resist showing off his car's performance. ""When you're at a stoplight and you've got a kid racer next to you in a muscle car ... you go off the line and he's just a little dot in the rearview mirror,"" he grinned. ""You just have to do that.""\There are currently 1,014 electric vehicles registered in New Hampshire, along with 7,032 hybrid-electric vehicles, according to the Division of Motor Vehicles.\That's still a tiny fraction of the 1,280,655 gas-powered vehicles out there, but the numbers are growing each year, according to Dolores Rebolledo, the Granite State Clean Cities Coalition coordinator for the Department of Environmental Services.\""We love our hybrids in New Hampshire,"" she said. ""We're all very aware of the benefits of sustainability, and being rural we do drive more than more concentrated areas.""\The number of EV charging stations also grows each year, she said. By last count, there were 150 outlets at 76 sites in New Hampshire.\Saturday's event felt like a combination of an old-fashioned car show and a technology expo.\As Catherine Corkery, chapter director of the Sierra Club, put it: ""There aren't a lot of gears here, but there are a lot of gearheads.""\Jeff Block of Amherst was showing off his brand-new black Tesla Model S. The vanity plate he ordered will read ""NOMOGAS.""Block drives about 40,000 miles a year for his sales job; the Tesla takes him 260 miles on a charge. And, he said, ""It's a fun car to drive.""\The car has auto-pilot, which uses radar, cameras and sensors to sense the surrounding environment.\It's not what some people think, Block said. You still have to keep your eyes forward and your hands nearby. ""It can't see traffic signals,"" he said.\But it does change speeds when it senses a speed limit sign, and it slows automatically if there's traffic ahead. ""You have to pay attention while you're driving, for sure, but it's a much more relaxing way to drive,"" he said.\And if you do happen to fall asleep, lights will flash and alarms will sound. ""It will wake you up,"" he promised.\On Wednesday, Tesla plans to release a new software update that will reportedly enhance the auto-pilot features. ""I don't know what to expect, but it's already amazing,"" Block said.\His car has a feature called ""summon."" When you summon it, the car starts itself and comes to where you're waiting. ""It will literally back itself out of your garage.""\The way Block sees it, Tesla is more of a high-tech company than a car company. ""They just happen to make cars.""\Block has always loved gadgets, and he loves cars with style. But, he said, ""For me, the environment was a big, big factor. Just because I drive so much.""\""I'm just one car, but it makes me feel a little bit better.""\Angelo Valenti of Litchfield was showing off the 2012 Chevy Volt he bought earlier this year. He also has a 2012 Nissan Leaf at home.\The first time he drove an electric car, he said, ""was a life-changing experience.""\""I just said I've got to get this,"" he said.\Valenti, a mechanical engineer, attended the same Concord event two years ago. He recalled having a conversation about self-driving technology with an economist, who predicted it wouldn't be available until 2040 if ever.\""I wonder what he's thinking now,"" Valenti said. ""Now everyone's talking about it. It's happening.""\Some drivers were surprised to learn lawmakers here are considering an added fee for fuel-efficient vehicles.\The House Public Works and Highways Committee will meet Tuesday to discuss proposed legislation to assess a ""road usage fee"" on vehicles that get more than 20 miles per gallon, based on mileage and travel.\The idea came out of a study committee looking for ways to make up for the fact that electric-vehicle owners don't pay the gas tax, which goes to maintain state roadways.\Jeff Block said he'd have no problem paying a road usage fee for his Tesla. ""I'm not trying to cheat the system,"" he said. ""Things have to be paid for. I have no issue with that whatsoever.""\But Curran said the benefits of zero-emission vehicles should be considered in any such discussion. ""If you look at the impact of gas-powered cars on the climate, and you look at what I'm doing, there should be a benefit to doing the right thing,"" he said.\One popular attraction at Saturday's event was an all-electric bus built by Proterra, a South Carolina company.\Stephen O'Neil, regional sales director, said Proterra buses are operating in 15 cities, including Dallas, Philadelphia and Seattle. He said the company is working to get more buses into New England; he met recently with folks in Manchester.\Proterra also makes extended-range buses and is about to unveil a model that will have a range of up to 350 miles on a full charge.\Miriam Wilcox of Candia climbed on board the electric bus with her 4-year-old daughter Avery for a quick ride about the block.\By the time her daughter is old enough to drive, Wilcox said, ""I'm actually hopeful that by then we'll have much better fuel economy on our cars and hopefully better emissions.""\Several owners said they use solar panels to charge their vehicles at home.\That's how Steve Sanders of Londonderry charges his family's four electric cars, including the black Tesla Roadster he was showing off Saturday.\It goes from zero to 60 in 3.6 seconds, he pointed out. ""It's a one-speed transmission that goes 132 miles an hour in first gear.""\And that comes in handy, Sanders said. On his way up to Concord Saturday, another driver was tailgating him.\When a light changed, he made his point. ""I look in the rearview mirror; she's still at the light.""\Credit: By SHAWNE WICKHAM New Hampshire Sunday News"
99,". Money for state: Lawmakers are looking at how to keep funds available for roads, bridges.\Thousands of Granite Staters are driving hybrid, electric or alternative-fuel vehicles as a way to save money and protect the environment.\And new CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standards are boosting fuel economy for gas-powered cars and light trucks.\But one unintended consequence is that the gas-tax revenues that fund the roads and bridges are decreasing, in New Hampshire and across the nation.\Now there's a growing consensus among state leaders that New Hamp\shire should find a way to ensure all drivers are paying their fair share.\Michael Pillsbury is deputy commissioner of the state Department of Transportation. He described the problem of highway maintenance: ""It takes the same effort as it did a number of years ago, it costs more and revenues are stagnant.""\In the New Hampshire Constitution, the state's gas tax is called the ""road toll."" The state collects 18 cents per gallon from distributors, and dealers add that cost to the price paid at the pump, Pillsbury said.\The system worked just fine for a long time, he said.\""The nice thing about a gas tax is it is a user fee,"" he said. ""If you don't drive very much, you don't pay a tax. If you drive a lot, you pay more because you're using the roads more.""\But what happens if your vehicle uses biodiesel, electricity or compressed natural gas (CNG) instead of gasoline? You still use roads and bridges; you're just not helping to pay for them.\According to the state Department of Environmental Services, there were 156 electric cars registered in New Hampshire last year. And there were about 14,000 hybrids, out of a total of 1.4 million vehicles, registered here in 2011.\A previous state law required ""alternative energy"" vehicles to ""pre-pay road toll fees at the time of registration,"" an amount equal to twice the annual registration fee, Pillsbury noted. It was repealed in 2001.\The idea may get a second look.\No fee on CNG\Rep. Candace Bouchard, D-Concord, chairs the House Transportation Committee. She said the idea of capturing revenue from alternative-fuel vehicles has been discussed in Concord for years.\Her own interest in the issue was reawakened when she learned that a new CNG fueling station was being built in Pembroke. There are other CNG stations at the state DOT, Nashua Public Works Department and the University of New Hampshire.\""And a lot of commercial fleets are now switching over to CNG,"" Bouchard said. However, she said, ""There's no user fee on that fuel.""\Bouchard has begun researching the issue for possible legislation in the upcoming session.\""I look at it as just being progressive. As we're all trying to be more fuel-efficient or looking for other fuel sources, we still have to keep our infrastructure workable,"" she said.\Sen. David Watters, D-Dover, said he expects to file legislation addressing the issue of hybrids and electric vehicles. He's considering proposing a surcharge on the registration fee for such vehicles.\And while he expects the owners of those vehicles may grumble, Watters noted they're still saving money on the gas tax.\He's also considering proposing that any funds raised by such a surcharge be dedicated to what's called ""betterment,"" money that goes directly to local municipalities for their roads.\That would offset property taxes that would otherwise go to maintain those roads. ""And maybe that makes it more palatable,"" he said.\Gasoline usage trend\In the early 2000s, the gasoline usage the road toll was based on was increasing each year. But that trend has reversed, and revenue from the road toll is projected to drop about a half-percent a year, according to Scott Bryer, road toll administrator at the Department of Safety.\In fiscal year 2005, when vehicles used 860,955,143 gallons of gas, the gas tax brought in nearly $155 million, according to figures provided by the department.\In 2009, the gallonage dropped to 815,353,404, which raised about $146.8 million in road tolls. And for 2013, that figure is projected at 801,737,916 gallons, or about $144.3 million.\Rebecca Ohler is transportation and energy program manager at the Department of Environmental Services' Air Resources Division. She said there have been ongoing discussions between the DES and the DOT about the effects of reducing petroleum use and improving vehicle efficiency.\Her division is tasked with protecting air quality, Ohler said, which includes reducing air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles.\""But in our opinion, every vehicle that's on the roadway should be paying their fair share for the support of the roadway network,"" she said. ""Bridges that continue to stand are everybody's concern.""\Some states are looking at systems that tax drivers based on how many miles they drive each year, Ohler noted. But here, she said, that would work best on a regional basis, since commuters and vacationers use roads and buy fuel across state lines.\""The solutions in theory are so simple, but in practice are very complex,"" she said.\""In theory, you just do a formula with the weight of the vehicle and the number of miles driven and you've got your solution. But then there are people that have privacy concerns about not wanting to have to divulge how many miles they drive in a year.\""And it would be very complex to implement because it would mean all of the states need to talk to each other.""\Still, officials say the state's current dependence on a gas tax to maintain the roads isn't sustainable as more vehicles use alternative fuels or get better fuel economy.\""I think as we move closer and closer to crisis, there's going to be more impetus for people to keep the conversation going and really bring some solutions to the forefront for broader discussion,"" Ohler said.\Pillsbury expects some of the privacy and jurisdictional concerns will be worked out over the next decade.\swickham@unionleader.com\s"
100,".$50 million: Bill would charge certain automobile owners a fee to replace fuel taxes the state highway fund has lost because of fuel-efficient vehicles.\CONCORD Fairness is in the eye of the beholder.\A proposed highway usage fee intended to ensure owners of hybrid and electric vehicles pay their fair share for using the state's transportation system discriminates against fuel-efficient vehicle owners and low-mileage drivers, a House committee was told Tuesday.\House Bill 1602 would charge automobile owners a fee based on federal fuel mileage estimates to replace the fuel tax the state highway fund has lost because of fuel efficiency and alternative-fuel vehicles.\The plan would raise about $50 million a year dedicated to roads and bridges.\""This is a good start,"" said former Rep. John Graham of Bedford, who worked on the issue of diminishing highway fund revenue for years. ""This levels the playing field.""\However, others said those who drive few miles a year like the elderly or who purchase fuel-efficient or alternative-fuel vehicles to save money and help the environment will pay more while owners of gas guzzlers and tractor-trailer trucks that do more harm to the highways and the environment will not.\""Let's call a spade a spade. This is a tax on energy efficiency,"" said Nancy Reiss of East Kingston, who owns a fuel-efficient car. ""This is cynical legislation in light of the push for energy efficiency.""\The bill has the backing of business organizations as well as the construction industry, but not environmentalists nor the conservative, anti-tax Americans For Prosperity-NH.\In an attempt to make highway funding more equitable, said AFP-NH director Greg Moore, the proposal is inequitable to others.\""This mission has changed from how do you get hybrid and electric car owners to pay their fair share,"" he said, ""to how do we get more money for highways,"" noting just 18 months ago the state approved an increase in the gas tax, producing $35 million in additional money for the state highway fund.\But Business and Industry Association Senior Vice President David Jevet said the plan is a fair attempt to ensure all vehicle owners pay something to maintain and build the state's highway system.\""The road and bridge system is critically important to not only the citizens of the state who use it, but to our businesses who depend on it,"" Juvet said, adding the increase in funding will also help preserve the state's billion dollars of investment in the transportation system.\""All of us have a stake in this fight,"" he told the committee.\The plan was developed by the bill's prime sponsor Rep. Norman Major, R-Plaistow, who said he wanted to develop a plan that would allow the state to recoup the lost revenue over the years from greater fuel efficiency to maintain the current transportation system.\And he said he wanted a plan simple enough that the state would not need ""an army of bureaucrats to administer.""\Under the plan, the base vehicle would get 20 miles per gallon and travel 13,500 miles a year, the federal Department of Transportation average.\The owner of that vehicle pays about $150 a year in gas tax that goes to the state's highway fund.\The owner of a more fuel-efficient vehicle pays less in gas tax to the highway fund, but the road usage fee would bring the total to $150.\For example, if a vehicle is rated at 40 miles per gallon, the owner would pay $75 in gas taxes so the road usage fee would be $75 to bring the total to $150.\Major notes people with more efficient vehicles will retain about 90 percent of their savings from having to buy less fuel.\Motorcycles, mopeds and vehicles built before 1984 would be exempt from the fee. And vehicles rated 20 mpg or less would not pay the usage fee.\Town or city clerks would collect the fee based on the VIN number when the owner registers the vehicle and pays the license plate fees.\The highway fund has been losing revenue for years as gas prices soared and cars became more fuel efficient. The expansion of electric, hybrid and natural gas powered-vehicles whose owners pay little or no gas tax has increased the fund's deficit.\Reiss suggested a flat fee for every vehicle that is registered in the state, but others suggested heavier vehicles that do the most damage to the roads and bridges should pay more to reflect their cost to the system.\The committee did not make an immediate recommendation on the bill, which is also expected to be reviewed by the House Ways and Means Committee if the House initially approves the plan.\grayno@unionleader.com\Credit: By GARRY RAYNO State House Bureau"
101,"
State Sen. Jim Rausch of Derry announced he won't seek re-election yesterday, making him the third Republican senator who plans to vacate his seat alongside Sens. Bob Odell of New London and Peter Bragdon of Milford.
\
Even during times of intense polarization at the State House, all three have shown a willingness to work across the aisle on at least a few major issues, leading to bipartisan plans to increase the state's gas tax to pay for road and bridge repairs, expand Medicaid and join 10 other states in a plan to reduce carbon emissions. But it's these very types of initiatives that have led conservatives, including the Republican Liberty Caucus, to threaten primaries against incumbent Senate Republicans. With the retirement of just these three senators, the New Hampshire Senate could look very different next year.
\
""A big question is who emerges as the Republican candidates in those districts, and will they be in a similar cast to those three or will they be more partisan,"" said Dante Scala, associate professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire.
\
Conservative challengers emerged in both Odell's and Rausch's districts even before the two announced their retirement plans, but both point to family as their reasons for retiring. Both have been in the Legislature for 14 years, with Rausch spending four in the Senate and Odell 12. Bragdon is retiring to continue his work as executive director of HealthTrust, a job that caused him to step down as Senate president and prompted an ethics investigation last fall. He will leave the Legislature on June 6. No Senate Democrats have yet announced plans to retire, but more announcements are likely. About one-third of the Senate turns over each year.
\
New Hampshire Republican Party Vice Chairman JP Marzullo will take on former New Hampshire Banking Association president Jerry Little in a primary to replace Odell, while state Rep. Linda Tanner of Georges Mills is the Democrat seeking his seat. State Reps. Regina Birdsell of Hampstead and Frank Sapareto of Derry, as well as Jim Foley, chairman of the Derry Republican Committee, will face off for Rausch's seat. For Bragdon's seat, Rep. Gary Daniels of Milford and Merrimack town Councilor Dan Dwyer, who lost to Bragdon in a 2012 primary, both told WMUR they will run.
\
Democrats are feeling confident about their chances of picking up seats.
\
""We have motivated, strong candidates on the ballot, and the (Democratic Party) will be working doggedly to give our candidates the support they need to connect with families across the state who are sick of far-right representatives who work more for the special interests than for our communities,"" party Chairman Ray Buckley said in a statement. ""With these Republicans leaving the Senate, and the far right primaries that are shaping up, it is clear the Tea Party faction of the (Republican Party) is flexing its muscle.""
\
But Bragdon noted that all three districts have a moderate edge, which he said makes it likely Republicans elected to run for those seats will bring a similar approach to their predecessors.
\
Odell's seat
\
Based on the numbers, Democrats have the best shot at picking up Odell's seat. His district, which covers 24 towns including Antrim, Hillsborough, New London, Newbury and Weare, voted for Democrat Maggie Hassan by a wide margin in the 2012 election and President Obama by a smaller one. Odell has built a reputation as one of the Senate's most bipartisan Republicans. He worked on a Medicaid expansion plan that uses the federal dollars to expand access to private health care for 50,000 individuals, supported the gas tax increase and was one of two Republicans to vote for repealing the death penalty after a memorable speech on the Senate floor.
\
Rausch's seat
\
Rausch's district, which covers Derry, Hampstead and Windham, is solidly Republican. One of Rausch's biggest legacies will be his effort to increase the gas tax by 4 cents, the first increase since 1991. His effort took serious heat from Republican groups, and just four other Republicans, including Bragdon and Odell, supported the bill. Rausch also said his work with Republican Sen. Nancy Stiles to revamp the state's education funding formula is one of his proudest accomplishments. He also joined six other Republicans to vote for Medicaid expansion. After spending 10 years in the House, Rausch said the Senate has a more collegial environment.
\
""I am a Republican. I believe in Republican principles, but through all that, we have to solve problems,"" Rausch said.
\
Bragdon's seat
\
Bragdon controlled the Senate during Bill O'Brien's reign as speaker of the House, and the Senate often handled issues with a more pragmatic approach than the lower chamber. In 2008, Bragdon co-sponsored legislation bringing New Hampshire into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade type agreement with 10 other states aimed at reducing carbon emissions by power plants. Bragdon voted this year for the gas tax increase, but largely because he was able to secure an elimination of tolls in Merrimack as part of the deal. He recused himself on the Medicaid expansion vote, citing a conflict of interest with his work at HealthTrust. Bragdon said he believes its possible to work across the aisle without giving up on ""underlying core principles.""
\
""I do think my approach is to sit down with people and talk about stuff and see if you can come to a meeting of the minds,"" he said. You ""treat each other with respect, and that comes in handy the next time you want to deal with an issue.""
\
His district, made up of Amherst, Merrimack, Milford and Wilton, voted for Hassan in the 2012 governor's race, but for Republican Mitt Romney in the presidential.
\
For all of the three seats, vigorous primaries are expected.
\
The Republican Liberty Caucus plans to hold steady on its promise to find ""liberty-minded"" candidates to challenge every senator, Republicans and Democrats, who voted for Medicaid expansion, Chairman Aaron Day said. As of now, they've recruited 20 candidates.
\
All candidates for statewide office must file to run between June 4-13. Voters will have until the Sept. 9 primary to decide whose approach they like best.

102,"
How much appetite do voters have for reliving what is sometimes called the psychodrama of the 1990s, the one that culminated with Bill Clinton's impeachment? We often wonder, and while they'd never say it, the question must occur to staffers for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. In the so-far genteel Democratic primary, that question has remained unanswered.
\
There are some who are fixing for a fight. Witness Matt Drudge's seizing last week on a remark Michelle Obama made on the campaign trail in Iowa. Obama told voters that she takes care of their daughters while her husband, Barack, is on the campaign trail. ""Our view is that if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House,"" she said.
\
The Drudge and other ruckus around that remark - was there a subtext about the Clintons?!?! - prompted Barack Obama to hold a conference call. ""The whole thing about Hillary has been completely fabricated,"" Obama said, according to the AP. ""You guys have got to get it off your minds.""
\
We're inclined to think the Obama dust-up was phony. But other Clinton opponents have unquestionably stepped up their attacks on the Clinton legacy this week, and they've come to New Hampshire to do it.
\
John Edwards was touring the state with a new stump speech this weekend, knocking nostalgia and saying that ""those wedded to the policies of the '70s, '80s or the '90s are wedded to the past - ideas and policies that are tired, shopworn and obsolete."" So, senator, how about a candidate wedded to the guy who was president in the 1990s?
\
Edwards took his attacks even further, pledging to cut off corruption, saying: ""The American people deserve to know that their presidency is not for sale. The Lincoln bedroom was not for rent."" This last is a bulls-eye on the Clinton years and the practice of letting donors spend a night at the White House.
\
Then, the Union-Leader criticized Clinton in an editorial Friday titled ""Clinton's surge-ery: Now it's working, now it's not"" for her statements about on the troop ""surge"" in Iraq. In a speech Monday, Clinton said that the U.S. had ""begun to change tactics in Iraq and in some areas, particularly in Al-Anbar province, it's working."" On
\
Wednesday, she said ""it has failed,"" noting the lack of political progress in Iraq. (The New York senator has opposed the surge from the outset, her campaign points out.)
\
Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd's campaign seized on the ""Surge-ery"" editorial, circulating a statement criticizing Clinton in critical language straight out of the 1990s.
\
""It's unnerving that a would-be commander in chief can't, or won't, make up her mind on something as fundamental as the success or failure of Bush's surge,"" said Jim Jordan, a senior Dodd adviser. ""Really, it smells like more poll-driven straddling.""
\
Clinton's campaign responded to Edwards on Thursday by saying ""angry attacks on other Democrats won't improve senator Edwards's flagging campaign,"" in the words of spokeswoman Kathleen Strand.
\
On Friday, Strand added: ""Bill Clinton was a great president who made America a better place. Any Democrat who disagrees with that is free to say so.""
\
Got change?
\
Talk of political ""change"" was front and center in the Democratic presidential primary last week, after Edwards denounced what he described as a corrupt Washington system and implied that Clinton is part of that system (he later said his comments had nothing to do with Clinton). Edwards deemed himself the ""change"" candidate.
\
At two Clinton events Thursday afternoon, several voters weighed in on the ""change"" issue. Here's an entirely unscientific sample:
\
""Barack Obama, in my eye, if you're going for the real change candidate, that's the one,"" said Cheryl Scott of Hillsboro, who stopped by MainStreet BookEnds in Warner for a glimpse of Clinton (Scott is still undecided). But Scott and her husband, Paul, said that change is less important than competence.
\
""If it's an insider and he or she can get the job done, that's equally important,"" Paul Scott said.
\
Craig Nevins of Warner saw Edwards's comments as part of the inevitable ""taking on the front-runner.""
\
""The top candidates all take money from corporations,"" Nevins added.
\
For Deirdre Sheer-Gross, a Clinton supporter, Clinton's motto (""ready for change, ready to lead"") ""is a great message that we're changing, but we're also bringing back what was good.""
\
Neal Byles, a high school English teacher, saw the issue of change from two angles. ""It is important to me; national politicians get very removed from where they're from,"" Byles said in Concord. That said, entering the White House a Washington outsider ""does come with its own problems,"" he said. ""The Clinton administration encountered that.""
\
BookEnds
\
Clinton bought a little light reading at MainStreet BookEnds in Warner Thursday. Her pick? Alexander McCall Smith's The Careful Use of Compliments, a novel described by Publisher's Weekly as a detective book that also explores ""mysteries of the heart.""
\
The war is on
\
The heat continues on John Sununu - and to a lesser extent, Sen. Judd Gregg - around Iraq. Since the spring, anti-war groups have been on the airwaves with ads urging them to stop the war, including one tailored to Sununu featuring a picture of the senator with his arm around President Bush.
\
New Hampshire airwaves saw pro-war ads last week, put up by Freedom Watch, the group co-founded by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer. The ads feature veterans, a widow and a mother who lost her son in the war urging Congress to continue the war. The group said they have a $15 million ad buy but declined to say how much they spent in New Hampshire.
\
Meanwhile, a suite of anti-war groups are planning an all-night stakeout outside Sununu's office in Manchester tomorrow night, followed by a 5 p.m. rally at Memorial Park Tuesday.
\
This week's U.S. News and World Report features a look at the coalition of anti-war groups that have coordinated campaigns across the country this summer, focusing on the efforts in New Hampshire on Sununu. The article is titled: ""Protesters: No-Show or Go-Slow.""
\
One for Bradley
\
That didn't take long. Two days after former health commissioner John Stephen announced that he's looking to make a run for Congress, his soon-to-be primary opponent former representative Jeb Bradley picked up his first endorsement from the Republican Main Street Partnership PAC.
\
Stephen and Bradley will be vying for the Republican nod to challenge Rep. Carol Shea-Porter for the First District congressional seat next year. Bradley lost the seat to Shea-Porter last year.
\
The PAC bills itself as supporting moderate candidates. Bradley was a member of the group when he was in Congress, said the PAC's Sarah Chamberlain.
\
""Jeb Bradley charted a centrist, independent way during his time in Congress,"" said Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, who leads the PAC, said in a statement. ""New Hampshire needs Congressman Bradley's common-sense, pragmatic leadership.""
\
Still shopping
\
Sen. Lou D'Allesandro is still shopping for a presidential candidate. And in recent days, he's received close-ups with two: Clinton attended a party at D'Allesandro's home Thursday, and Bill Richardson is due to make the same stop this morning.
\
Richardson has a lot to live up to. Clinton, D'Allesandro said, ""was outstanding. She stayed, had her picture taken with everybody, talked to everybody. She was most gracious,"" he said. ""And she was very well received by the audience. Very, very well received.""
\
""Obviously I have great respect for her intellect, her grasp of the issues, her articulation of the issues, and I think it brings down the negative myth about her,"" he said. D'Allesandro supported John Edwards in 2004.
\
Pro-tax
\
New Hampshire lawmakers may be wary of raising the gas tax to pay for transportation projects. But nationally, some policy wonks tout higher gas taxes as a way to simultaneously shore up the environment, reduce road congestion, enhance national security and, of course, raise money.
\
Harvard University economist N. Gregory Mankiw (who served as chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers from 2003 to 2005) is a leading proponent. Last year in the Wall Street Journal, Mankiw offered a manifesto for the Pigou Club, the group of pundits and wonks committed to higher Pigovian taxes (named after economist Arthur Pigou, and referring to levies that help counteract negative activity, such as taxes on polluters).
\
Mankiw was pushing for a increase in the federal gas tax: "" Even after a $1 hike, the U.S. gas tax would still be less than half the level in, say, Great Britain, which last I checked is still a democracy,"" he wrote. ""But don't expect those vying for office to come around until the American people recognize that while higher gas taxes are unattractive, the alternatives are even worse.""
\
In addition to encouraging motorists to reduce oil consumption, a higher gas tax could bring down the price of gas: ""As a higher gas tax discouraged oil consumption, the price of oil would fall in world markets,"" he wrote. ""Some of the tax would in effect be paid by Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.""
\
Disappearing dollars
\
Where does highway fund money go, when it's not going to the Department of Transportation? In fiscal year 2007, Department of Safety won the most, taking more than $70 million from the fund. More than $28 million went to cities and towns. Other winners: Health and Human Services ($367,000), district and municipal courts ($1.7 million), Department of Justice (about $1 million), highway safety ($400,000), tax and land appeals ($164,000) and Environmental Services ($41,000).
\
The transfers have become the subject of scrutiny, as the state struggles to find money for transportation projects. Gov. John Lynch is looking at how the money is disbursed, his budget director, Linda Hodgdon, said last week. Twenty years ago, 68 percent of revenue from the state gas tax and motor vehicle fees went to the Transportation Department. In 2007, that figure was 50 percent.
\
Rally the troops
\
Combat-boot wearing, tobacco-chewing ex-Marine Sen. Jim Webb will headline the New Hampshire Democratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner this year.
\
Webb, who took down incumbent senator George Allen to win the Virginia seat in one of the most closely watched races of 2006, will be on hand to rally the troops before what will surely be one of the most closely watched races of 2008.
\
""He was elected because veterans and working people in Virginia felt they didn't have a voice in Washington,"" New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley said in a statement. ""We've run into the same problem with John E. Sununu, and I predict a similar outcome here in 2008.""
\
The dinner is Oct. 20 at the Radisson in Manchester.
\
On the trail
\
- You may have noticed the ""Happy Birthday Gov. Huckabee"" bedecking the sign at the Concord Holiday Inn last week. Mike Huckabee wasn't staying in Concord last week; the sign was a part of a video birthday greeting sent to the governor, said New Hampshire campaign director Deb Vanderbeek.
\
- Today is Women's Equality Day. Clinton's campaign will hold a day of canvassing and phone-banking across the state followed by 11 celebrations in the state featuring New Hampshire elected officials. For more information, visit hillaryclinton.com/nh.
\
- Obama's campaign is also feting Women's Equality Day with a house party in Cornish. For more, visit nh.barackobama.com.

"
103,"Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan is seeking to unseat Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte in the state's U.S. Senate contest. Polls show the race in a dead-heat and the contest has received substantial national attention because it could decide party control of the Senate. Hassan, a two-term governor, is casting herself as a bipartisan problem solver who is not afraid to break with her party on issues of national security.\\Hassan, 58, had previously spent six years in the state Senate representing a district near the Seacoast and during the last two she was the Democratic majority leader. Hassan lives in Newfields with her husband, Tom, the former head of Phillips Exeter Academy.\As governor, she signed bills to expand Medicaid and increase funding for addiction treatment. Hassan vetoed proposals to do away with a conceal carry gun license. While she came into the corner office in 2012 with plans to raise the state's minimum wage and expand gambling to generate new state revenue, neither proposal got through the state Legislature.\Hassan is a strong supporter of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, though she faced criticism this summer over an awkward exchange on CNN when she dodged a reporter's question three times on whether Clinton is trustworthy. Hassan later clarified she finds the former secretary of state trustworthy and honest.\Economy \Hassan supports raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour, up from the current rate of $7.25 on which New Hampshire relies. She has proposed a plan to implement a new $1,000 tax credit for middle class families earning less than $200,000 a year, and she plans to pay for it by eliminating tax subsidies for major oil companies and businesses that move jobs abroad.\She supports passing the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill senate Democrats have proposed in Washington as a way to close the gender pay gap. It has failed in the Republican-led chamber.\Foreign policy \Hassan aligns with Washington Democrats on some foreign policy initiatives, but breaks with her party on others. She advocates the U.S. enforce an “imperfect” nuclear agreement with Iran, and says the deal is the best way to prevent the country from obtaining dangerous weapons.\She opposes President Obama's plan to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay and is against the administration's Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. On the Syria conflict, Hassan has voiced support for additional airstrikes and expanding the use of targeted special forces to combat ISIS.\Hassan was the only Democratic governor out of more than two dozen who called for the U.S. to stop accepting Syrian refugees in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks last year. She stands by her call for a temporary pause, and hasn't specified whether she supports Clinton's proposal to bring in 65,000 refugees from Syria.\Education\Hassan supports expanding the federal Pell grant program, which are need-based and unlike student loans, don't have to be repaid. The current maximum grant is $5,815 for the 2016-17 school year.\Hassan also supports efforts to allow students to refinance their college loans at current interest rates and would back cutting interest rates for new student loans.\Gun policy\Hassan supports Senate Democrats' proposals to expand background checks for purchases online and at gun shows, measures that have stalled in the Republican-led Senate. Currently, only licensed firearm dealers have to run checks on prospective buyers.\Hassan has also called for an “appropriate, fair assault weapons ban.” She supports restricting gun sales to people on the federal government's terrorist watch list.\Social Security\Hassan pledges to fight efforts to privatize or cut Social Security, which is expected to become insolvent within 20 years. Hassan is open to adjusting the payroll tax cap so wealthier citizens pay more into the system. She hasn't been specific about how much the threshold should be raised.\Transportation\Hassan opposes a raise in the federal gas tax, which was last hiked in 1994 to the current rate of 18.4 cents. Hassan signed legislation as governor increasing the state gas tax by four cents.\Hassan supports the creation of a national infrastructure bank, an independent government corporation that would support and help finance road and bridge projects, among others.\Health care \Hassan says the federal government should “build on the progress” of the Affordable Care Act because it has allowed people to get insurance coverage who have pre-existing conditions. She supports repealing the medical device tax.\She supports federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a health care and abortion provider that runs five clinics in New Hampshire.\Environment\On environmental issues, Hassan has advocated ending federal tax subsidies for major oil companies, investing in “green-energy technology” and creating a national model rule for net metering, which lets homeowners sell electric companies their excess solar power.\She doesn't plan to initiate or support a carbon tax “right now,” she has said. Hassan has voiced support for setting a national target of 50 percent clean and carbon-free electricity by 2030.\On Northern Pass, a controversial transmission line set to run through New Hampshire, Hassan said she supports additional burial. But she thinks blasting required for underground burial in some areas could be more environmentally damaging than putting the line overhead.\– Allie Morris"
104,"
The Business and Industry Association recently announced its determination to prepare an economic plan for the future of New Hampshire. As reported, its process begins with several working groups examining different areas of interest, followed by a synthesis of ideas culminating in a written report. This offers us an opportunity to raise our eyes from the tips of our shoes to the far horizon.
\
I hope this process goes well. I want a lot of people who have ideas to throw them into the mix for thoughtful discussion and evaluation. And since I really like issues related to our infrastructure and transportation systems, I'll offer a few thoughts of my own:
\
1. In the long run, it is more important that we create a modern, capable and secure transportation system than it is for us to continue the discussion of how we don't want to pay for one. We have a well-established tradition of not wanting to pay for things. Everybody gets that. But if we don't demonstrate some willingness to pay for the assets that move our goods, and us, lousy roads, broken bridges and second-class internet will eventually isolate us. None of that will bring new business to New Hampshire.
\
2. As we think about the future of our transportation systems, integration should be our primary objective. Everything we design and do should connect one transportation mode to another. Our airport needs to be connected to bus, truck and rail systems that allow people and goods to get where they're going. Our rail systems should connect to bus and intermodal truck routes that move up and out from our stations. There is business growth to be had in all of this. There is none if we fail. We live in a competitive environment, and people will go where they can get the transport they need. It's already happening.
\
3. Demographics must inform our planning process. Right now we are an aging state. Many older citizens do not want to drive everywhere. Buses and trains provide more reliable transportation service to an older population, particularly an older population that still wants to move around. And buses and trains belong in the center of urban areas, where people can get to them, not someplace else. A quick look at some of the urban redevelopment efforts in Sacco-Biddeford Maine, where a train station is helping to secure housing creation in an old industrial complex, helps to make the point.
\
4. We pay for most of our highway system with federal dollars and the gas tax. The state gas tax as currently designed is unable to sustain the system it is supposed to support. It's designed wrong. The gas tax is some number of pennies per gallon. As cars get much more efficient, the amount of gas used per mile goes down, the pennies collected go down too, while the number of miles driven (the equivalent of wear on the highways) goes up. We need to make the gas tax a percentage of total price at the pump, some number of pennies per dollar shown on the dial. If we still want to rely on a gas tax, that's the only way to maintain a revenue stream that will pay for fixing our roads and bridges. And because inefficient cars and trucks cost us all something in terms of air quality, maybe it's time to think of a sliding scale registration fee, or a sliding scale mileage charge. None of this will be popular, but it's a way of starting to pay for what we need.
\
5. Finally, a thought about the infrastructure for transmitting power: The state owns thousands of miles of right of way. As we plan for future development of an integrated transport system, why don't we have our state contract directly with entities wanting to transmit and sell power? The state could require power lines to be buried in state-owned rights of way, with private producers and utilities paying the costs and a rental charge.
\
This isn't my idea, but it sure seems appealing. A new state agency could be in charge of that process, acting for the benefit of the people of our state. It would seem to make a lot of sense.
\
I understand that the first reaction to this will be ""Government is bad and inefficient"" and ""Democrats just want to raise taxes."" The answers to these assertions are ""No, it isn't"" and ""No, we don't."" With that out of the way, can we now have a thoughtful discussion?

"
105,"
5:12 p.m.: Senators have approved a bill, 17-7, that creates a process for people to annul their mental health records and remove their names from a national gun background checks system.
\
The original version of the bill would've required the state to report names of mentally ill people to the system. But during hearings, senators heard testimony from people who said there was no way to remove their name from that list if their mental health improved. Sen. Andy Sanborn, a Bedford Republican, reference veterans coming home with post-traumatic stress disorder as people who deserve to have their records annulled if their health improves.
\
Sen. Sharon Carson, a Londonderry Republican, said the bill was about restoring Second Amendment rights to citizens.
\
""These people are caught up in a system that they cannot get out of,"" Carson said.
\
Another piece of the bill would've set up a committee to study how New Hampshire deals with mentally ill people and guns. The Senate killed that portion of the bill in a separate vote.
\
But several Democrats said the bill had too many questions and might place too much of a burden on local judges who must determine whether to annul a person's record. Sen. Donna Soucy, a Manchester Democrat, said the bill was ""putting the cart before the horse"" and that the issue needed further study.
\
The bill, Soucy said, ""will put guns into people's hands instead of considering a more thoughtful approach to who should have weapons.""
\
------------
\
1:52 p.m.: Senators voted by a slim margin to allow alcohol advertising on billboards, something which has been prohibited for the past 25 years.
\
The vote was 13-11, and came after a number of tie votes in attempts to table and kill the bill. Sen. Sam Catadlo, a Farmington Republican, ended the standoff by flipping his vote from no to yes.
\
Opponents said allowing for alcohol ads on the side of the road could lead to an increase in underage drinking and make teenager think drinking while driving is OK. New Hampshire has the second highest underage drinking rates in the country, said Sen. Jeanie Forrester, a Meredith Republican who strongly opposed the bill.
\
""We are responsible for creating a pursuing laws that strengthen the health and vitality of New Hampshire's economy,"" Forrester said.
\
But supporters of the bill said it was unconstitutional because it restricted speech on a specific group. They also said it was unlikely that alcohol ads on billboards would increase teen drinking, when alcohol is already advertised in newspapers and magazines and on TV. Getting rid of the ban on billboard ads would make state policy more consistent, supporters said.
\
""It is clear to me, and it's clear to many, that (the law), because it suppresses speech, rather than directly seeking to go after excessive alcohol consumption, is unconstitutional,"" Sen. David Pierce, a Lebanon Democrat, said.
\
------------
\
12:38 p.m.: Senators supported a bill to increase the gas tax to raise money for road and bridges repairs, 15-9. The bill now goes to the House, which is almost certain to pass it.
\
The bill will raise the gas tax by roughly 4.2 cents per gallon and allows the state to take out a $200 million bond for the widening of Interstate I-93 from Salem to Manchester. Sen. Jim Rausch, a Derry Republican and the bill's prime sponsor, worked with House members crafting the 10-year highway plan to have the bills go hand in hand. The 4.2 cent increase will bring in roughly $32 million in new revenue per year, all dedicated to road and bridge projects.
\
""(This bill) and the 10-year highway plan have been woven together to get to a process where we now can give to our citizens safer and better highways,"" Rausch said.
\
The bill also creates a committee to study whether the Department of Transportation is using its money efficiently. During the public hearing process, some Republican senators expressed concern about the department's continual need for new money. Furthermore, it repeals the increase once the bonds for the I-93 project are paid off.
\
The New Hampshire Republican Party and groups such as Americans for Prosperity have stood strongly against the tax, saying it will hit hardworking New Hampshire families. But Sen. David Pierce, a Lebanon Democrat, challenged that assertion. He presented research, prepared by two high school students in his district, that showed gas tax increases in other states haven't resulted in higher prices at the pump. Rather, the price of crude oil is the prime determinant in gas prices, he said.
\
""We should always take into account that a rise in a tax or a fee or a toll would have on our constituents,"" Pierce said. ""But I would suggest that, based on the data, raising the gas tax today would not hit our constituents.""
\
------------
\
10:53 a.m.: The Senate passed a bill requiring the state to evaluate whether new energy projects are in the public interest and to change the composition of the state body that approves energy projects, known as the Site Evaluation Committee. The bill passed on a voice vote.
\
The Site Evaluation Committee approves all new energy projects, including projects such as wind farms and the Northern Pass. This bill, in part, improves the committee's public hearing schedule for new projects. It also adds two public members to the committee and adds a staff director in an effort to streamline the approval process.
\
Under the bill, all energy project applications must include alternative methods for configuration, such as burying transmission lines, and must hold public information sessions in each county where the project would be located.
\
Senators praised all of the groups, including unions, developers, environmentalists and other stakeholders for coming together to craft a comprehensive bill.
\
""This was a very, very difficult bill,"" said Sen. Jeff Woodburn, a Dalton Democrat. ""This is the kind of work that we're sent here to do.""
\
------------
\
10:53 a.m.: The Senate passed a bill aimed at better preparing New Hampshire to deal with potential oil spills, 13-11.
\
Crude oil is currently transported from Portland, Maine to Montreal through a pipeline that runs through five towns in the North Country. Canada's National Energy Board has also recently approved a project to transport tar sands from Alberta to Montreal, which has the potential to also run through a North Country pipeline.
\
The bill, proposed by Sen. Jeff Woodburn, a Dalton Democrat, would require owners of oil pipelines to submit a spill response plan to the state Department of Safety. The bill also establishes an oil pollution control fund that would help fund salaries of state employees if cleanup of oil discharge into the water becomes necessary.
\
Without this bill, ""we are not on safe ground in terms of our moral obligation to our environment and to our North Country,"" Woodburn said.
\
------------
\
The New Hampshire Senate will take up bills today to increase the gas tax, create a commission to study gun purchases by the mentally ill, legalize two casinos and more. Stay tuned for updates throughout the day.

106,"
New Hampshire's gubernatorial candidates met for their final televised debate last night, underscoring now well-established contrasts on economic and other issues.
\
Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan and Walt Havenstein, her Republican challenger, traded a familiar chorus of criticisms against each other. Both of them characterize the other as an ineffective leader whose vision would harm the state in the long run.
\
In Hassan's view, Havenstein's economic proposals would threaten funding for key state institutions and programs, which in turn would harm New Hampshire residents who rely on those resources. But Havenstein warned that the governor is letting the state's economy languish by not creating an environment more attractive for businesses and failing to keep young people in New Hampshire.
\
Both are united, at least, in their desire to retain New Hampshire's young people and breathe more life into its economy, but they differ starkly on how to approach this. Havenstein's strategy is aimed primarily at businesses, lowering tax burdens and ""mak(ing) the state more competitive in the region and across the country."" Hassan said the state needs to focus on keeping its educational institutions within reach to avoid losing young adults to other states, and she plans to make ""restoring and improving the minimum wage"" a priority if re-elected.
\
The subject of right-to-work legislation is another issue on which the two disagreed. Right-to-work, as broadly defined by the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, ""secures the right of employees to decide for themselves whether or not to join or financially support a union."" If New Hampshire were to adopt a right-to-work policy, it would be the first New England state to do so.
\
Havenstein supports this as part of his economic plan to create 25,000 jobs by Aug. 15, 2017 - a proposal that includes, among other things, a plan to cut the business profits tax.
\
While Havenstein views this policy as a ""pro-jobs law"" that would make New Hampshire more attractive to companies, Hassan said such a move could threaten employees' collective bargaining abilities.
\
On energy, Havenstein said Hassan has failed to proactively address an energy crisis that has been looming for years. Hassan pointed to two proposals to bring more natural gas capacity to the state and emphasized a focus on improving energy efficiency in general.
\
Neither she nor Havenstein supports the Northern Pass project as proposed. Hassan repeated her position in favor of an approach that would meet the state's needs without compromising its landscape and natural resources. Havenstein said the state must step up its hydroelectric power capacity but dismissed current Northern Pass plans as ""not a balanced New Hampshire solution.""
\
And while Hassan pointed to the state's energy strategy as a sign of her work on the issue, Havenstein countered: ""What people are looking for is not a strategy, they're looking for action.""
\
The two also sparred, as they have in past debates, over the gas tax. Enacting the 4.2 cent increase in the tax, in Hassan's view, was necessary to fund infrastructure improvements across the state, as well as state troopers.
\
In Havenstein's view, a gas tax puts too much a strain on New Hampshire residents. He supports a move that would use money from the general fund to pay for some of the measures funded through the gas tax. Under a proposal put forward by state Sen. Jeb Bradley, the state would over a period of four years move to ""allow the diversion that's currently occurring to be part of the general operating fund"" and ""relieve pressure on the gas tax for roads and bridges,"" Havenstein said.
\
Hassan, during the debate, again repeated her support for a casino as a revenue source for the state. Havenstein said he opposes casino gambling as a revenue source and, after the debate, added that he would veto such a measure if it arrived on his desk as governor.
\
On the death penalty, Havenstein said certain crimes, such as killing a police officer, would warrant this type of punishment. The death penalty is an important deterrent against such crimes, he said.
\
Hassan said she opposes the death penalty ""as a matter of faith and conscience,"" but she does support life without parole as an alternative.
\
Leading into last night's debate, the latest poll from WMUR and the University of New Hampshire Survey Center put Hassan ahead of Havenstein. Asked who they would vote for Sunday - the day the survey was conducted - 45 percent of respondents who were likely voters chose Hassan, 31 percent chose Havenstein, 1 percent said they would pick someone else and 23 percent remained undecided.

"
107,"
John McCain's television ads tell voters to thank his rival, Barack Obama, for high gas prices. The press releases from the New Hampshire Democratic Party lay blame on Republican Sen. John Sununu. In the congressional races, the fingers point everywhere.
\
Beyond the tips of those fingers, the surging cost of driving a car or heating a home has brought a debate where fault flies everywhere: Alaska-loving environmentalists, profit-taking oilmen, SUV-driving moms, SUV-building car moguls, fast-growing China and India, greedy energy traders and shady Middle Eastern regimes.
\
Voters rank energy policy as among the most important issues in 2008. Unfortunately, energy experts say, there is no simple fix and there may be no way to bring back cheap oil. The nation's energy crisis, they say, may need as many responses as it has causes - a tough slogan to fit on a bumper sticker.
\
In the meantime, candidates have carved out a political debate on narrow territory. Both McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and an Arizona senator, and Obama, an Illinois senator and the presumptive Democratic nominee, have made energy the topic of one of their earliest attack ads. McCain's slams Obama for his opposition to wider drilling off the coast, saying the Democrat would bring us ""more foreign oil""; Obama's commercial notes the oil industry's donations to McCain and claims he's ""in the pocket of Big Oil.""
\
In truth, oil company employees have given to both McCain and Obama, though they've given three times as much to McCain. Meanwhile, Obama recently announced that he could back widened drilling as part of a compromise energy bill being negotiated in the Senate, a move that followed McCain's own conversion on such drilling earlier this year.
\
Obama calls for an ""all-hands-on-deck"" approach from scientists and citizens, a push towards new technology and conservation, with a goal of weaning the nation off Middle Eastern and Venezuelan oil in 10 years. McCain calls his plan an ""all of the above"" approach, a plan to use every available kind of energy to achieve greater energy independence.
\
What is clearest from Obama and McCain's advertisements - and from their advisers - is that each thinks the other is wrong.
\
Federico Pena, an Obama energy adviser who served as energy secretary under Bill Clinton, reels off a list of initiatives McCain has voted against, from fuel-efficiency standards to renewable energy initiatives. ""When you ask the question, What does John McCain stand for? After 26 years in Congress, it is not energy independence,"" Pena said.
\
McCain's domestic policy adviser Doug Holtz-Eakin, an economist, says that Obama sets such high standards for technologies McCain touts as crucial - particularly more nuclear energy plants - that he's proposing an effective ban.
\
""Do you want the Washington-based Barack Obama 'No'?"" he asks. ""Or, do you want somebody willing to make decisions. . . . That's a clear choice.""
\
McCain's campaign made political hay recently out of a recent Obama remark that instead of drilling offshore, the nation could save the same amount of oil if people kept their tires inflated. In Manchester and across the country last week, McCain's campaign handed out tire gauges labeled ""Obama's Energy Plan.""
\
For Jay Hakes, it's can be ""painful"" to watch the political debate on energy. Hakes, who led the Energy Information Administration in the 1990s under the Clinton administration, has devoted decades to reading and writing about energy, tracking presidential papers back to Richard Nixon on the topic.
\
For one, he says, it's ""astounding"" to him to hear McCain's campaign mocking Obama for suggesting that people can save gas by inflating their tires.
\
""Every administration has recommended that you inflate your tires properly,"" says Hakes, who also directs the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library. ""To now suddenly find this as a thing of great ridicule throws the whole history on its face.""
\
What follows is an overview of some of the technologies and ideas now being debated by Democrats and Republicans.
\
Offshore drilling
\
The federal government has banned drilling in federal waters offshore since 1981, everywhere except parts of the Gulf of Mexico and the Alaskan coasts. The banned areas may contain 18 billion barrels of oil. In 2005, the world consumed about 80 million barrels a day.
\
Athan Manuel of the Sierra Club, one of the groups opposed to offshore drilling, argues that the risks of ocean spills are too high and that the nation should be focused on finding an alternative to oil, not pumping the last drops out of the ground in environmentally sensitive areas.
\
""Once the price of gas passed four dollars a gallon, everybody literally went crazy talking about this issue,"" Manuel said.
\
In recent speeches, McCain has taken to the refrain: ""We need to drill here and we need to drill now.""
\
Holtz-Eakin, the McCain adviser, frames offshore drilling as one piece of the answer to the nation's energy woes. He contends that oil could be achieved in three to five years - a contention that other experts contest - and argues that it's important to send a message to the world that the United States will drill for its own oil.
\
""The real issue is how much of a signal do you send to world markets,"" Holtz-Eakin says.
\
Manuel argues that three to five years is wishful thinking. ""He's making that up,"" he said. ""I think if you ask the oil companies, they will tell you a different story.""
\
Even enthusiastic backers of offshore drilling have shied away from making predictions about how much such drilling would shave from the price of gas. On a recent conference call, Sununu called his Democratic opponent, Jeanne Shaheen, ""completely out of step with New Hampshire"" for her opposition to lifting the ban on offshore drilling.
\
Twice asked how much of a difference the drilling would make to the price of gas, Sununu declined to make a prediction. Instead, he argued that fuel markets are difficult to predict. ""No one projected the way in which the increase in demand from China and India would increase"" the price to begin with, Sununu noted.
\
To Hakes, drilling offshore makes sense - not just because that's where the next American oil is, but because natural gas found offshore is the cleanest fossil fuel going. Moreover, he said, more domestic production will help the United States decrease a trade deficit driven by billions of spending on oil from other countries.
\
And, he said, drilling offshore can be done ""relatively benignly for the environment,"" in contrast to some of the oil we now use. For example, he said, the United States has been importing tar sands from Canada that are ""terrible for the environment.""
\
""I think the environmentalists who sort of dig their feet in the sand and say 'never' on this are blind,"" he said.
\
On the other hand, Hakes said, those who tout drilling as a cure-all are engaging in a ""shell game."" And on time frame, he said, there are a lot of steps between now and offshore oil: The law must be changed, then the drilling goes out to bids, then there's exploration and seismology, then drilling equipment must be found and deployed, and finally, the companies will have to drill until they strike oil.
\
""I actually favor offshore drilling, I don't think the McCain position is a bad position,"" Hakes aid. ""But I think the rationale for it is a little misleading.""
\
Pena, the Obama adviser, agrees with that. He cites a statistic that Obama favors: If the United States drilled everywhere, top to bottom, that would amount to 3 percent of world reserves. ""That would not make a dent in world oil supply,"" Pena said.
\
""The point that Sen. Obama's making, that I'm making: 'Let us once and for all end this temptation we have into being lulled back into thinking we can drill our way out of this,' "" Pena said.
\
Holiday
\
The idea of a ""gas tax holiday"" dominated the news earlier this summer. The idea, backed by McCain and former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, is simple: Suspend the 18-cent federal gas tax for the summer to give drivers some relief from high gas prices. Obama opposed the idea, calling it a gimmick that would do little to help drivers.
\
Economists panned the plan. Jay Shambaugh, an assistant professor of economics at Dartmouth, bluntly calls the holiday ""bad idea.""
\
If the tax is removed but supply stays constrained, Shambaugh said, the price would probably stay the same, but the oil companies and gas stations may get a slightly bigger profit - while the federal highway fund is deprived of revenue for road repair. ""The downside to it is you're handing government revenue that has to be made up somewhere else to the oil companies,"" Shambaugh said.
\
""There's a reason people have put out challenges to find a single economist who thinks it's a good idea and no one has stepped up,"" Shambaugh said. In May, during an appearance on This Week with George Stephanopoulos, Clinton couldn't name one, but instead quipped: ""I'm not going to put my lot in with economists.""
\
Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, disagrees.
\
""She should have mentioned me!"" he said.
\
He says there are two major reasons why the holiday idea is misunderstood. It's not meant to be a long-term solution. ""We're using this to get families through the summer,"" he said.
\
Moreover, he said, looking at places where taxes have been suspended, consumers have seen savings. ""In final analysis, it will depend on how people react on the ground,"" he said.
\
For his part, Obama has a different short-term solution: Releasing 70 million barrels of oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve and swapping in less expensive, lower-grade crude.
\
Holtz-Eakin said he was scratching his head at that idea - which, he argued, was a poor use of the nation's emergency supplies of oil. Obama himself, he noted, had previously opposed the idea of such an oil release.
\
""What's the purpose?"" Holtz-Eakin asked. ""I guess I don't understand.""
\
Shambaugh, the Dartmouth economist, said that if there's a bubble in the market, an infusion of supply might help drive down prices. But he said it wasn't a particularly substantial proposal. ""It's basically window dressing,"" he said.
\
Going nuclear
\
McCain has proposed building 45 new nuclear plants, a nearly 50 percent increase over the nation's 104 active nuclear plants that currently supply about one-fifth of the nation's electricity. Nuclear emits no greenhouse gases and runs on uranium, available domestically.
\
""We do want to drive our cars off nuclear power,"" Holtz-Eakin says.
\
But it's unclear how much of a dent in national supply even 45 new plants would make. In an interview last year, a spokeswoman for the nuclear-industry-funded Clean and Safe Energy Coalition told the Monitor that the nuclear industry would need to build 35 to 40 new nuclear plants by 2030 just to maintain its one-fifth share of the national market.
\
Obama has not taken nuclear power off the table - but, he says, the nation first must find something to do about nuclear waste that does not involve storing it in Nevada's Yucca Mountain. To Holtz-Eakin, that's an effective ban. ""They're determined not to solve the waste thing in any way.""
\
Obama energy adviser Heather Zichal disagrees. Yucca is off the table, she said, but ""Plan B can be figured out.""
\
""On nukes in particular, he's said, 'Look. I take the climate science seriously and I know that nuclear energy cannot for that reason cannot be off the table. But we need to figure out what we're going to do with the waste.' ""
\
Speculators
\
There's been another front in the energy wars: The trading floor. Democrats like Shaheen have urged cracking down on what they call unwarranted speculation in the energy markets that may be driving energy prices up. When Shaheen unveiled her five-point energy plan in June, the first two points involved crackdowns on speculation here and in offshore markets that trade in U.S. oil contracts.
\
But no one - not outside experts, not advisers to Obama or McCain - ventured to say how significant a factor such speculation might actually be.
\
""No one knows with any precision because no one really knows with any precision what a speculator is,"" said Holtz-Eakin, of the McCain campaign.
\
Pena said that ""although it cannot be proven,"" there is reason to believe that speculation may have caused anywhere from 5 to 30 percent of the increase in world oil prices.
\
Hakes, formerly of the Energy Information Administration, said a crackdown on speculation might help. Analysts can't quite explain the surge in energy prices, he said, which is an indication that there might be unwarranted speculation going on.
\
""Like the offshore drilling, it's being oversold by its proponents,"" he said. ""It's probably not a bad thing to do in a moderate form.""
\
Politics
\
Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of oil has dipped this month. On Friday, a barrel's cost was down to $115 - not the $20-a-barrel days of 2002, but a significant decrease from mid-July, when the price neared $150 a barrel. That, says Hakes, is in part attributable to a decline in demand in the United States.
\
Here in New Hampshire, drivers burned through 4 million gallons less fuel this July than they did the previous year.
\
No one expects that to take the energy issue off the radar screen for November.
\
""Voters are confronted with gas prices every day,"" said Dante Scala, an associate professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire. ""It's something that stares them in the face every day.""
\
For Obama, the issue may reflect a familiar challenge, Scala said. During the primaries, he fared well with liberal, highly-educated, upper-income voters, sometimes shorthanded as the chardonnay-drinkers and Prius-drivers of the world. But Democratic rival Hillary Clinton consistently outperformed him among those with lower incomes and lower education levels, sometimes dubbed lunchpail Democrats.
\
""Energy is an issue that I think disproportionately affects middle-class and working-class voters,"" Scala said. Moreover, people of higher income levels think of the problem differently. ""For someone who's driving a Prius, they're thinking of it in terms of being environmentally friendly and so forth. . . . It's more of an inconvenience.""
\
It's hard to get across a nuanced explanation, Scala said, in such a complex and urgent issue. ""If I'm any example of an average voter, we're not all that literate about it,"" he said.
\
But Hakes thinks voters may be wiser than politicians think. From his own days in politics, working for Democratic Sen. Bob Graham and others, Hakes said he evolved a simple philosophy: ""Treating the voter like an adult actually can pay off.""
\
He said he took heart during the ""gas tax holiday"" debate. He noted that Obama, despite opposing what sounded on its face like a gift to drivers, overwhelmingly won the North Carolina primary and narrowly lost the primary in Indiana.
\
""Perhaps the voters are getting smarter,"" he said.
\
But as the general election campaign has heated up, it's brought a crop of what Hakes calls ""silly season"" proposals.
\
""Obviously the pollsters for the candidates don't believe they're getting smarter, and they're dumbing it down,"" he said.

Raise gasoline tax to lower oil consumption
\
Last night, in a wide-ranging State of the Union address, President Bush outlined a series of proposals to cut energy consumption, reduce America's dependence on imported oil and curb a significant amount of the carbon dioxide emissions that are fueling global warming.
\
Among those proposals was a call to reduce gasoline consumption by increasing the average fuel economy of new cars by 4 percent per year for passenger vehicles starting in 2010 and for light trucks starting in 2012. Combined with a requirement to increase the percentage of ethanol and other renewable fuels, the increased standards would cut vehicle emissions by 10 percent by 2017, the president said.
\
We welcome every effort to stem global warming and increase the nation's energy independence. The proposal was especially welcome from this president, who has been slow to recognize the threat posed by global warming.
\
But the president didn't go far enough. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules he calls for, for example, would, in the name of safety, continue to set much lower fuel economy standards for bigger, heavier trucks. That helps preserve the incentive to purchase SUVs and other gas hogs, which makes driving more dangerous for people in small cars. To remove that incentive, the fuel standards should apply across the board.
\
What's really needed, along with an increase in fuel efficiency, is an increase in the federal gas tax. It has been frozen at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. Plans to raise the gas tax to discourage consumption and encourage changes in the auto industry have been around for years. None have won broad political support, but an increase is needed.
\
A plan sketched out by Harvard economist Greg Mankiw suggests one direction to pursue. Mankiw calls for a $1-per-gallon tax phased in at the rate of 10 cents per year to allow consumers and the auto industry to adapt. The tax increase would push manufacturers to increase fuel efficiency standards on their own. And since higher prices would lead to a drop in consumption, world oil prices would decline. That would reduce the real impact of the tax increase on consumers. It would also mean that less money would be exported to places where terrorists could get their hands on it.
\
The apparent pace of global warming justifies an even steeper tax increase. But the gas tax, like all sales taxes, is regressive. It hits people with lower incomes, older cars and long commutes much harder than high-income suburbanites who drive SUVs, and it has little or no effect on people who take public transportation.
\
Like all tax increases, raising the federal per-gallon levy will create winners and losers. But that doesn't mean that an increase, if properly designed to protect the poor, shouldn't be instituted.
\
We applaud the heightened focus on the environment the president showed last night. His proposals show that he's taking the twin problems of energy dependence and climate change seriously. Everyone should.

\
It's a truism that retirement frees people to do what they always wanted: Walleye fishing, volunteering, maybe filling long days with nothing at all. Interim Transportation Commissioner Chuck O'Leary has taken the time to go back to the office and tell his bosses just what he thinks.
\
O'Leary was brought back from retirement this year and charged with straightening out the department's finances. Never shy - in the 1990s, he drew heat for advising people to ""drive fast and don't look back"" over dilapidated bridges - O'Leary has lately unleashed a long string of bad news and zingers.
\
On Wednesday, he told the executive council that more than $1 billion worth of road projects should be cut from the state's 10-year highway plan. He added: ""Incidentally, sir, my car is outside and the motor is running.""
\
He stayed through the meeting, but O'Leary's time is indeed limited. He was brought back this year to finish out the term of Carol Murray, who resigned under pressure from Gov. John Lynch. That term ends in December.
\
This week, O'Leary reported that as construction costs have surged, the state's 10-year highway plan has grown so bloated that it would take 35 years to complete. He recommended a host of cuts, including slowing the expansion of Interstate 93 and scrapping the proposed Franklin-Northfield connector.
\
""We've overpromised, and I simply don't think we can go around doing business as usual,"" O'Leary said.
\
People who've worked with O'Leary over the years said he's the same in retirement as ever but maybe a bit more so.
\
""He's just the same as he was, but liberated,"" said Donna Sytek, a former speaker of the House. ""I think he just turned up the knob a little bit.""
\
A Naval Academy graduate who made a career in business before he took the commissioner's job in 1990, O'Leary isn't a career transportation department employee. He's sometimes butted heads with politicians, most prominently with former governor Steve Merrill, who tried and failed to fire him after the bridges comment brouhaha.
\
He's also been known to flatly object to pet projects, legislators said. ""He's persuaded by numbers and facts,"" Sytek said. ""And a lot of times, the siting of highways isn't about numbers and facts, it's about feelings and politics.""
\
A couple of years ago, O'Leary was tapped to serve on a citizens committee on transportation planning. What Lew Feldstein, the group's chairman, remembers is that O'Leary attended every meeting but didn't ""choose to throw his weight around.""
\
When he was in his 20s, Feldstein - now chairman of the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation - spent a year working for John Wayne as a personal assistant. Feldstein likened O'Leary to the movie star.
\
""He's got the same clear sense of himself that the Duke does: 'This is who I am,' "" Feldstein said. ""I can almost picture Chuck, like John Wayne, like the Duke, walking down the middle of a road somewhere in Dodge City, with spurs jangling.""
\
O'Leary has also made an enemy or two along the way. David Berliner, a Concord veterinarian and avid bicyclist, wrote a letter to the Monitor recently saying the department needs a new leader. Berliner said he'd served on a committee in the 1990s charged with recommendations for making the state's road bicycle friendly and came away with a bad impression of O'Leary.
\
""He was very autocratic over the things that we worked hard to come up with,"" he said, adding that he never met O'Leary. ""Our recommendations just died on somebody's desk, and the word we got was it was Mr. O'Leary's desk.""
\
For years, problems have been brewing at the department of transportation.
\
Last summer, a legislative audit faulted the department for poor bookkeeping and outdated billing systems. Meanwhile, legislators say, it's become clear in the past several years that the 10-year plan had become overgrown - some thought it would take 15 years or more to finish.
\
This week, O'Leary reported that it's actually a 35-year plan. He pitched $1.1 billion in cuts from the $4.1 billion list - enough to trim that down to 22 years.
\
""I think everybody's aware of the problem,"" said Rep. Candace Bouchard, a Concord Democrat who chairs the public works committee. ""Nobody knew how big it is.""
\
Over the years, a few too many projects may have made the list, said Councilor Ray Burton, a Bath Republican. (In his North Country district, the hottest cut on O'Leary's list was the Conway Bypass.)
\
Burton described O'Leary's style this way: ""The answer is generally 'Yes,' 'No,' 'Will do,' 'There's no money,' "" he said. ""Right now, for what we've got afoot and ahead of us in the Department of Transportation, he's the right man for the right hour.""
\
But when he presented his report to the executive council this week, O'Leary didn't limit his answers to just those problems. Asked if an increased gas tax would help pay for more projects, he said it would - but that the list would also have to be cut.
\
Then, he foresaw a future decline in gas tax revenues, as ""people are opting out of gas guzzlers"" out of a ""higher sense of purpose."" He recalled that the gas tax increase he oversaw in the early 1990s coincided with an ""incredible growth in vehicle miles"" along with the rise of SUVs.
\
""I'd go out by the side of the road and cheer on all the SUVs that were bolting along at 85 miles an hour because they were just burning up gasoline,"" he said. ""But that's not a good thing for the environment; it's not a good thing for national defense.""
\
O'Leary, who took the interim post in March and has been commuting to Concord from his Massachusetts home, has seen more troubles than just the 10-year plan.
\
Last month, he and other state officials announced that transportation employees had illegally dumped hazardous lead waste in Franklin starting in 1980. He said then that some transportation employees ""just don't get it,"" adding ""we intend to correct that."" Among other corrective measures, the department will undergo a full environmental review of all the department's practices.
\
Department Spokesman Bill Boynton said that before O'Leary's return, he hadn't seen the commissioner in years. He went up to O'Leary to welcome him back.
\
""He turned to me, and he said, 'I got a bone to pick with you,' "" Boynton said. O'Leary's beef: The pictures in the newsletter weren't clear enough.

110,"Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte is seeking a second term in Washington, and facing a competitive re-election challenge from Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. Recent polls show the race in a near statistical tie. The contest has received substantial national attention, and outside money, because it could tip party control of the Senate. Ayotte has cast herself as a Republican willing to work across the aisle and break with her party on environmental and health issues.\\Ayotte, 48, was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010. She was previously the New Hampshire attorney general. In Washington, Ayotte has made a name for herself as a foreign policy hawk and she often aligns with Arizona Sen. John McCain and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. She serves on the Senate Armed Services and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees, among others. Ayotte lives in Nashua with her husband, Joseph Daley, who runs a landscape design and installation firm.\In the Senate, Ayotte co-sponsored a bill that sets up national prevention efforts and expands medically assisted treatment, used to wean people off heroin or other opioids. She joined onto a bipartisan effort to prevent people on the federal government's “no fly” list from buying guns.\Ayotte for most of the campaign supported Donald Trump's candidacy, but declined to endorse him. The word play earned ridicule from Democrats. Ayotte withdrew her support for Trump in October.\Economy\Ayotte has said a raise in minimum wage depends on the economic climate. She thinks the best way to raise pay is to grow the economy. She supports simplifying and reforming the tax code and lowering federal business taxes. The country, she said, should adopt a “globally-competitive corporate tax rate,” to lower business taxes for large and small businesses.\Ayotte has opposed the Democratic Paycheck Fairness Act, and instead favors a bill she sponsored called the GAP Act, which similarly aims to ensure women receive equal pay as men. Her plan doesn't go as far as the Democratic bill, supported by New Hampshire's senior senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat.\Ayotte supports a federal Balanced Budget Amendment.\Foreign policy\Ayotte opposes the Iran nuclear agreement she calls “dangerous.” She signed onto a letter in 2015 with 46 other Senate Republicans warning Iranian leaders that any deal could be undone by the next president and Congress.\She opposes President Obama's plan to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay. On the Syria conflict, Ayotte has called for the U.S. to undertake a “more aggressive” air campaign and run more special operations raids targeting ISIS leaders. On immigration, Ayotte has said securing the border is key. She backed the so-called “gang of eight” immigration compromise in 2013 that would have created a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. It did not get through Congress.\Education\On higher education, Ayotte said she supports letting students use Pell Grants toward short-term job training programs that last at least eight weeks. Currently, the grants can only be used to finance academic programs that are at least 15 weeks long, the average length of a college semester. Federal Pell Grants are need-based and unlike student loans, don't have to be repaid..\Gun policy\Ayotte has voted against efforts to expand background checks for purchases online and at gun shows, and has instead said Congress should “fix the current system.” Currently, only licensed firearm dealers have to run checks on prospective buyers. Ayotte supports further prosecutions of gun crimes and increasing mental health records given to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.\The Republican signed onto a bipartisan bill this year restricting gun sales to people on the federal government's “no-fly” list. The measure stalled and has yet to come up for a Senate vote.\Social Security\Ayotte has said she supports a “bipartisan” solution on Social Security that maintains benefits for retirees and preserves the program for generations to come. The Republican is open to so-called means-testing, or reducing benefits to high-income participants, but said she doesn't have any specific numbers in mind.\She has also voiced support for adjusting the payroll tax cap, but hasn't been specific about the threshold.\Transportation\Ayotte opposes a raise in the federal gas tax, which was last hiked in 1994 to the current rate of 18.4 cents. She instead supports the creation of a national infrastructure fund that could help finance road and bridge projects.\Health care \Ayotte has voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and calls it unaffordable for many New Hampshire families. She has said she wants to restore and expand Health Savings Accounts and double flexible spending accounts, which let people save their money tax free to cover health care costs.\Ayotte has voted to block federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a healthcare and abortion provider that runs five clinics in New Hampshire. Ayotte has sponsored a bill to make birth control available without a prescription, but the legislation came under fire from Democrats who say it undermines rules that mandate insurance coverage of contraception. Ayotte disputes the claim.\Environment\While she opposes a carbon tax, Ayotte was the first Republican in the U.S. Senate to publicly back the Environmental Protection Agency's proposal to reduce fossil fuel emissions. The Clean Power Plan aims to cut carbon emissions 32 percent by 2030.\Ayotte believes in an “all of the above” energy approach, which relies on renewable energy and on fossil fuels. Ayotte, along with most Senate Republicans, supported the Keystone XL pipeline, which was rejected by President Obama in 2015.\Ayotte called for full burial of Northern Pass, a transmission line set to run through the state.\– Allie Morris"
111,"U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte bucked most of her Republican colleagues on Wednesday and supported a Democratic-authored resolution that declares that climate change is real and ""human activity significantly contributes"" to it.Only four other Republican senators voted with Ayotte, and no Democrats opposed the resolution, which failed because it did not receive the 60 votes necessary for adoption.The vote puts Ayotte at odds with several Republicans widely expected to be running for president, including Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Flordia.For years Ayotte has been quoted saying that humans likely have an effect on climate change, but rarely has such a vote been cast to declare such a position.""Dating back to her time as attorney general, Senator Ayotte has a long record of standing up for clean air and crossing party lines to protect New Hampshire's environment, and her votes this week are consistent with that record,"" said her spokesman, Liz Johnson.Those include opposing efforts to roll back EPA clean air regulations to prevent cross-state pollution and pollution from mercury and other toxins.The resolution was taken up by the Senate as part of the Keystone Pipeline legislation, which environmentalists oppose and President Obama has said he will veto.Ayotte has already signaled her support of the Keystone Pipeline, and a conservative organization on Thursday said it's not worried about Ayotte's vote on the non-binding resolution.""Our goal is reliable, affordable energy because it's a driver of our economy. Sen. Ayotte has been a consistent supporter of that,"" said Greg Moore, state director of Americans for Prosperity, which is associated with the Koch brothers.""Our focus is on actual policies,"" he said. Moore said Ayotte opposes a gas tax increase, EPA regulations designed to control carbon emissions and previous cap-and-trade proposals. And she supports Keystone.Voting with Ayotte were Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Susan Collins of Maine, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mark Kirk of Illinois.The resolution received 50 votes. It said the warmer temperatures ""reverberate throughout the climate systems of the Earth"" and cause higher sea levels, changes in precipitation, and altered weather patterns.The Senate did vote 98 to 1 in favor of a resolution that said climate change was real. Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., opposed the resolution.\mhayward@unionleader.com\Credit: By MARK HAYWARD New Hampshire Union Leader"
112,"
There is no doubt a sales tax will cost jobs in communities across the state, cause dramatic decreases in state revenue, irreparably damage local economies and take more money out of the pockets of New Hampshire citizens, particularly those who can least afford it.
\
Yet again one legislator has proposed that New Hampshire adopt a sales tax. It is troubling that there are still some in our Legislature who believe a sales tax would be a benefit to the citizens and government of New Hampshire.
\
On Thursday at 1 p.m. the House Ways & Means Committee will hold a hearing on that bill, HB 1611. The Retail Merchants Association and other business group representatives will be there to stand up for small business and retail employees to explain why this bill should not pass.
\
It is simple economics that the way an economy is built is to entice people outside the state to come here, leave their money and return to their state of residence. If we can no longer say ""tax-free shopping,"" no matter the rate, we cannot draw customers to travel for the savings, and New Hampshire's economy would be the poorer for it. We have built our economy in part on the ""tax-free shopping"" environment and to change that would be ruinous to state revenue, the state's economy and the state citizens.
\
A sales tax is regressive, hurting those who can least afford to pay it, costing fixed-income and low-income individually disproportionately more than middle and higher income individuals. And it would eliminate jobs among those who can least afford it.
\
Previous studies have found that a sales tax, even at a low rate, would mean the loss of 15 to 20 percent of retail sales in border communities and 8 to 12 percent in other areas, with the loss of over 20,000 jobs in the retail sector alone, and another 10,000 jobs in collateral damage to other types of businesses.
\
Commercial real estate, which has been developed in New Hampshire to the extent it has in part due to our no-tax status, would see heavy decreases in value.
\
The loss of retail sales also impacts other sectors of the economy and state revenue: business taxes will suffer, meals and rooms tax revenue will be lost, gas tax revenue will be lost and unemployment will rise.
\
It is the hope of the Retail Merchants Association of New Hampshire, representing the retail businesses in the state both small and large, that the Ways & Means Committee sends this bill without hesitation to the full House with a motion to kill the bill.

Legislators think state revenue will fall nearly $200 million short of expectations set in the current two-year budget, according to new numbers projected by the House yesterday. The numbers show New Hampshire residents are buying and selling less property than expected, are smoking fewer cigarettes and may be letting up on the gas. There is one levy expected to hold steady: the beer tax.
\
The new projections passed on a busy day when legislators gave final clearance to a regional greenhouse gas compact, agreed on a ban to the cremation alternative known as Resomation and set up House-Senate negotiations on the rollout of mandatory kindergarten and on overhauls to the shakily funded New Hampshire Retirement System. Members of the House also voted down an effort to revive debate on whether the president and vice president should be impeached.
\
Revenue is now expected to fall about $66 million short in the fiscal year that ends in June and $130 million short next year, according to new projections recommended by the House Ways and Means Committee and passed by the House, 194-77.
\
Tanking business taxes make the biggest losses to come, comprising about half of the shortfall next year, or nearly $60 million in fiscal year 2009, said Rep. Susan Almy, the Lebanon Democrat who chairs the committee.
\
But shortfalls are expected almost across the board over the two-year biennium.
\
The sluggish housing market is showing in real estate transfer taxes, which are now projected to sag $50 million short, with next year's shortfall slightly bigger than this year's.
\
Liquor sales are expected to fall $15 million short of expectations for the biennium.
\
Tobacco taxes are expected to bring in $30 million less than originally projected, a falloff Almy attributed not to a decline in smoking, but to smokers' disapproval of new fire-safe cigarettes and switching to other products, like mini-cigars and snuff, to avoid taxes.
\
Lottery tickets are expected to reel in $12.8 million less than expected for the education trust fund.
\
Soaring gas prices will have an unclear effect on the state's gas tax, a 19.6-cent levy paid for every gallon that goes primarily into the highway fund for road repairs, Almy said. Anticipating that drivers may cut back next year, the committee shaved $2 million off expectations for fiscal 2009.
\
A few taxes are holding roughly steady: The beer tax, the utility consumption tax and court fees are among them. Horse- and dog-racing revenue is is expected to surpass expectations, drawing in $200,000 more than the $6 million budget-writers anticipated.
\
Kindergarten
\
The details of the state's transition to universal, mandatory kindergarten will be negotiated by legislators in the House and Senate in the weeks to come. One key question remains: Will schools be allowed to contract with private kindergartens during the four-year transition phase?
\
The Senate voted yesterday to ask the House to negotiate a compromise on a bill that would give 12 towns that don't offer kindergarten another year to start programs.
\
The Legislature included public kindergarten as a requirement for all schools in the definition of an adequate education adopted last year. That law originally gave the 12 towns without kindergarten until September 2008 to offer programs.
\
The House and Senate agree the districts need more time, but they disagree on using private kindergarten programs as a substitute for programs provided in public schools. Both would give districts another year to start programs. The House also would give districts four years to contract with private providers as a transition to having their own programs.
\
Both would pay for temporary classrooms - the Senate for three years, the House for four.
\
Retirement

Despite intense pressure from unions, the House voted yesterday to insist on negotiations with the Senate on legislation overhauling the state's cash-strapped retirement system.
\
The New Hampshire Retirement Security Coalition - representing 70,000 active and retired public employees - lobbied for the House to agree with the Senate and send the bill on to Gov. John Lynch. The New Hampshire Municipal Association, which represents cities and towns, preferred the House version.
\
In the end, the House voted 205-100 yesterday to ask the Senate to confer. The two versions have the same immediate impact - stemming projected increases in employers' bills from 50 percent to about 15 percent - and both obtain savings by limiting increases to a medical subsidy that helps many public employees buy health insurance.
\
But the House makes longer-term changes, including halving the number of employee representatives on the board and extending the retirement age of police officers and firefighters from 45 to 50. Meanwhile, the Senate allows for bigger cost-of-living adjustments and sends $1,000 to all retirees who've worked for 15 years or less and collect a pension smaller than $20,000.
\
Critics of the House plan urged representatives to agree to the Senate's version as a better deal for workers. Manchester Democrat Daniel Sullivan argued the House's proposed changes went too far.
\
""What we have to do is stay the course and keep plugging away at this,"" he said.
\
But Rep. Ricia McMahon, a North Sutton Democrat who is a member of the retirement system's board, said the House version made long-term, necessary fixes.
\
""Stay the course is not good enough,"" she said. ""We have to steady the ship, and sometimes you have to avoid icebergs, and we need to do that now.""
\
The legislation continues work begun last year to shore up the $6 billion state retirement system. The plan is funded at 63 percent of its long-term liabilities, short by about $2.7 billion on its annuity fund alone. Benefits are also in poor shape: The health subsidy fund is about a half billion dollars short, and the fund that pays for cost-of-living adjustments is expected to run dry in a matter of years.
\
Resomation
\
The Legislature wants to overturn a new law allowing a new mortuary science that uses lye in hot water to dissolve bodies as an alternative to cremation.
\
The state Senate voted yesterday to send Gov. John Lynch a bill to reverse a 2-year-old law that allows Resomation - a process now used on human cadavers in only two places, the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Alkaline hydrolysis is legal in New Hampshire and Minnesota under cremation statutes.
\
The bill instead prohibits the process and establishes a committee to study how to regulate it. The committee must report to lawmakers by Nov. 1.
\
Asked if Lynch would sign the bill, spokesman Colin Manning said Lynch would ""be reviewing the bill.""
\
The Senate had adopted regulations, but the House balked at allowing the process. Some House members argued the process has not had a proper vetting. New Hampshire legalized the process in 2006 with a little-noticed sentence in a lengthy bill responding to a scandal at an unlicensed crematorium.
\
Greenhouse gases
\
New Hampshire is poised to become the 10th state to participate in a regional effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
\
The House voted yesterday to send Gov. John Lynch legislation to implement the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative but to revisit it if Congress enacts a federal program. The House next considers changes made to the proposal, especially on how much money would go into a fund to promote energy efficiency.
\
The bill adds New Hampshire to the other New England states, New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland in a market-based, ""cap-and-trade"" program to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the region's power plants.
\
Lynch says the initiative will help New Hampshire's environment and economy.
\
""Cutting greenhouse gas pollution is the right thing to do for the health of our citizens, the health of our environment and the health of our economy. Joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative will allow New Hampshire to cut the emissions that contribute to global climate change, increase energy efficiency, and in the long term will help consumers save on energy costs,"" Lynch said in a statement.
\
Under RGGI, a regional carbon dioxide emissions cap would be put in place for large fossil-fuel-fired power plants beginning in 2009. Allowances would be issued equal to the total cap and apportioned to the participating states. Utilities would have to buy enough allowances within three years to cover their emissions. Since the number of allowances is limited by the regional cap, overall emissions are expected to be reduced.
\
The money utilities pay for the allowances would go into a state-regulated fund to improve energy efficiency. Money from the sale of allowances above a certain threshold would go back to electricity ratepayers.
\
The House proposed an initial threshold of $12 per ton, while the Senate set its 2009 mark at $6 per ton. The House voted to accept the Senate's threshold. Business groups had wanted the mark set at $2 per ton. The threshold rises over time in both versions to 2015. After 2015, all proceeds go into the fund.
\
Cigarette taxes
\
While the size of the state's budget shortfall is clear, it's not yet clear how legislators plan to fill it. Yesterday, the Senate voted to negotiate with the House over a plan to delay a cigarette tax increase proposed by the governor.
\
The House proposed delaying implementing the tax increase to attract smokers from other states to buy cigarettes at relatively bargain prices. The Senate voted yesterday to ask the House to negotiate a compromise over a bill that contains the tax.
\
The House version would delay a proposed 25-cent cigarette tax increase in hopes residents from other states, especially Massachusetts, will stock up on New Hampshire smokes. The House rejected a move to kill the tax increase altogether.
\
Under the House plan, New Hampshire's cigarette tax revenue would have to fall below $50 million between July 1 and Oct. 1 for the state's $1.08 tax to go up a quarter.
\
Poker
\
The New Hampshire House wants to talk with the Senate about its proposal to tax charity poker games.
\
The bill raises the maximum bet from $2 to $5.
\
A 3 percent tax would apply in tournaments where the playing chips have no monetary value. A 10 percent tax would apply if the chips had a monetary value.
\
The tax would bring in about $3.5 million a year. The state already gets a share of wagers on Bingo and Lucky Seven.
\
Highway plan
\
The New Hampshire House has voted to negotiate with the Senate a 10-year, $2.3 billion highway plan that cuts the current plan almost in half.
\
The House did not like amendments the Senate added, including authorization to borrow $80 million for school construction aid. The House had already rejected the borrowing in another bill.
\
The bill cut more than $2 billion in projects. Lawmakers estimated that funding for the pared-down plan would still fall short by $200 million, but they said the plan would be reviewed every two years to make adjustments.
\
The plan also endorsed a major shift from new construction to projects to preserve the current system and fix troubled bridges.
\
It would replace or fix 89 red-list bridges over 10 years, place a priority on sections of Interstate 93 that have the greatest safety and congestion problems, repair the Memorial Bridge in Portsmouth and widen the Spaulding Turnpike.
\
Sex offenders
\
State lawmakers are negotiating a compromise over a bill to establish a new system for classifying sex offenders and requirements for them to register after getting out of prison.
\
The bill creates a three-tier system for classifying sexual offenders and offenders against children. It recognizes that differences between sex crimes can vary from more minor offenses like indecent exposure to more serious offenses like child molestation and forcible rape.
\
For the most serious offenses, lifetime registration on the public list will be required, while for lesser offenses, the period can be shorter and the ability to petition off the list will be available in certain circumstances.
\
The Senate removed a House provision that would have required the state to collect DNA from all felons - instead requiring the samples to be taken from sex offenders and violent offenders. The Senate also refused to support publicly listing where sex offenders work. The Senate said that provision punished employers.
\
Child porn
\
Tough new sanctions on child pornography have passed both the House and the Senate, but they're at odds over whether regulations should apply to youths under the age of 18 or 16.
\
The House wants to include youths to age 18; the Senate proposes the lower age. The chambers have until May 30 to negotiate a compromise.
\
The difference is in a bill to strengthen the child pornography law by splitting it into three offenses: possession, distribution and manufacture. Each offense would carry enhanced penalties for repeat offenders.
\
The House also added a penalty for distributing pornographic material in violation of a court order or nondisclosure agreement.
\
People who use the internet to prey on children would face longer prison time under the bill. Repeat offenders who manufacture child pornography could face life in prison.

114,"Monitor staff \More efficient vehicles would pay a sliding fee to compensate for paying less gas tax under a bill going through the Legislature, which would start adding the penalty to vehicles getting as little as 21 mpg.\The bill passed the House floor, 194-143, last Thursday and is now being considered by the House Finance Committee. Fees would be highest for the most-fuel efficient vehicles, as the bill establishes a variable charge as high as $111 for electric vehicles, down to zero for vehicles that get less than 20 mpg.\It differs from laws in many other states that place a flat fee on all electric or hybrid vehicles. A separate bill before the House Public Works and Highways Committee would do just that, adding $100 to the annual registration fee for all hybrid vehicles and $200 to all electric vehicles.\The motivation behind the various pieces of legislation is concern about how to pay to maintain roads and highways. For decades, road-repair money in New Hampshire and elsewhere has largely come from state and federal gasoline taxes, on top of fixed registration fees. This means that the more a vehicle drives, the more its owner pays in gas tax, acting as a proxy for how much wear they caused on the roads.\The arrival of efficient vehicles using less gasoline – and now electric cars that use no gasoline at all – has upended this calculation, prompting the state to find new ways to bring road upkeep money in line with drivers' road usage.\Opponents of such extra payments say they penalize vehicle owners who do less damage to the environment while rewarding the owners of inefficient, more-polluting vehicles.\The $111 figure in House Bill 1763 is the calculated amount that a 20-mpg vehicle would pay into the fund used to maintain New Hampshire highways if it drove 10,000 miles in a year. This charge would be paid on top of annual vehicle registration and kept in a separate fund for highway upkeep.\The amount paid by a vehicle would depend on its EPA-rated mileage. Vehicles that get better than 20 mpg would pay a small portion of the $111 figure, while vehicles with higher mileage would pay a larger portion, up to the full $111 charge for electric vehicles. Details of the specific charges are not included in the bill.\The bill says implementing the program would cost an estimated $330,000, partly for equipment to connect local registrars' offices with official EPA mpg ratings.\"
115,"New Hampshire Union Leader\MANCHESTER -- From the Salem-to-Manchester expansion of Interstate 93, to establishing high-speed passenger rail, to routine highway and bridge maintenance, the state's transportation system needs more money.\That was the message yesterday at the Business and Industry Association's annual meeting to review transportation and infrastructure issues as state, federal and local officials and experts discussed ground, rail, air and even water-borne transportation problems and needs.\While state transportation projects need more money, the Manchester-Boston Regional Airport needs more passengers, attendees were told.\Urging people to fly Manchester, airport director Mark Brewer said, people need to send airlines the right message in this competitive environment. ""We are now in the use-it-or-lose-it mode,"" Brewer said.\Airlines have slashed the number of seats available in Manchester, Brewer said, and changed from an operating policy of market share at any price to what each flight yields financially. ""We need to use the services we have more instead of getting on a bus or into a limousine to go to Boston Logan,"" he said.\House Public Works Committee chair Candace Bouchard, D-Concord, said there is not enough money to pay for all the projects in the state 10-Year Transportation Improvement Plan or to keep up with routine maintenance and preservation of what is already built.\""Everybody agrees our highways need more money,"" Bouchard said, but what that revenue source should be is open to debate. ""It's all politics,"" she said, noting the Commission To Study Future Sustainable Revenue Sources For Funding Improvements To State And Municipal Highways And Bridges she chairs, will present lawmakers after the next election with a menu of revenue options.\Janet Kavinoky, director of Infrastructure for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told a similar tale of woe about federal transportation funding.\""To plan for multiyear projects you need a user-fee-based source of funding -- a gas tax or diesel tax -- but we can't get the politics lined-up right,"" she said. ""We all know what we have to do.""\The federal gas or diesel tax has not been increased since 1993 and the state gas tax was last increased in 1992. Bouchard said in that time, construction costs have increased by 40 to 60 percent, which puts the transportation system further behind.\Kavinoky said there is talk in Washington of doing away with the federal highway fund and having the department of transportation compete with all other federal agencies for federal dollars. ""This is just not acceptable when at the very least you need to maintain the current transportation system to support interstate commerce or to compete globally,"" she said.\Katherine Hersh, Nashua Community Development director, explained plans for returning commuter rail to southern New Hampshire and instituting high-speed rail between Concord and Boston.\She noted that finding enough money to cover yearly operating costs has been an issue, but added Maine subsidizes the Downeaster train between Portland and Boston with federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funds."
116,".At Radisson Hotel on Friday: Non-partisan gathering will discuss topics the Legislature is likely to take up this year.\NASHUA With the new legislative session kicking off this week, state representatives have been invited to participate in a forum to discuss important topics that are affecting the community.\On Friday, dozens of elected officials from southern New Hampshire are expected to attend the 2014 Legislative Symposium. Hosted by the Greater Nashua Chamber of Commerce, the fifth annual event will include a panel of business professionals set to address key issues that will be discussed in Concord in the coming year.\The panel will debate three general topics a gas tax, Northern Pass and Medicaid and Medicare expansion.\""This event gives the chamber and local business leaders an opportunity to discuss outside of Concord potentially controversial topics in a neutral environment,"" said Chris Williams, president of the Greater Nashua Chamber of Commerce.\The symposium is a nonpartisan forum where legislators can gather to informally debate issues outside of specific bills, focusing more on larger topics that will directly affect the local business community, Williams said.\""We approach the issues through the lens of the business community's needs over the next 10 years, and break down the trends to see where we are compared to where we need to be,"" says a posting about the symposium on the chamber's website\Six panelists will be featured at the event, which will be held from 1 p.m. to 6:45 p.m. Friday at the Radisson Hotel in Nashua, 11 Tara Blvd.\The first of three seminars will provide an overview of Medicaid expansion in New Hampshire, and will include speeches from Steve Norton, executive director of the New Hampshire Center for Public Policy; Tom Wilhelmsen Jr., CEO of Southern New Hampshire Medical Center; and Charlie Arlinghaus, president of The Josiah Bartlett Center.\The second seminar titled ""Is it Time for a Gas Tax in New Hampshire?"" will include speakers Chris Clement of the New Hampshire Department of Transportation, state Rep. David Campbell\of Nashua, and Arlinghaus, who will return for additional comments on this topic.\The final seminar will feature William Quinlan, president of Public Service of New Hampshire, who will discuss why divestiture of PSNH assets matter to southern New Hampshire.\The symposium is open to the public, and will be followed by an informal reception. The event was originally designed to be held every other year, but because of such tremendous feedback from legislators and business owners, the chamber decided to host the event annually.\About 45 area legislators are expected to participate, in addition to Mayor Donnalee Lozeau and about three city aldermen, according to Williams. An estimated 30 people from the public will likely attend, he added.\Nashua's delegation, which was predominantly Republican before the 2012 election, is now mainly Democrats. The Democrats are returning to power in Nashua with 23 members of the House of Representatives and just three Republicans.\Friday's symposium is sponsored by BAE Systems and PSNH.

117,".10 GOP primaries: Three Republican incumbents face challengers Tuesday; lone Democrat primary battle.\CONCORD Senate President Chuck Morse, R-Salem, is uncontested in the fall elections, but Democrats continue to eye his majority control and its slim 13-11 margin.The Senate chamber will certainly see several new faces given retirements, including Senate Minority Leader Sylvia Larsen, D-Concord, and Sens. Bob Odell, R-New London, and Jim Rausch, R-Derry, and the resignation of former Senate President Peter Bragdon, R-Milford.On Tuesday, there are 11 primary contests for state Senate candidates, and 10 of them are Republican primaries. The lone Democratic primary battle is between Kass Ardinger and Dan Feltes, both of Concord. That primary winner on Tuesday will face Republican Lydia Dube Herman of Warner on Nov. 4.Three Republican incumbents have primary challengers: Sen. Jeanie Forrester of Meredith faces Free State Project attorney Timothy Condon of Grafton (District 2), Sen. David Boutin of Hooksett faces Jane Cormier of Hooksett (District 16), and Sen. Nancy Stiles of Hampton faces Steve Kenda of North Hampton (District 24).The open seat in District 11 with Bragdon's resignation drew a crowd in the Republican leaning district, including Rep. Gary Daniels, R-Milford, former Rep. Maureen Mooney of Merrimack, Merrimack Town Councilor Daniel Dwyer and Merrimack attorney Dan Hynes.Three Republicans seek to replace Rausch in the District 19 contest: current Reps. Regina Birdsell of Hampstead and Frank V. Sapareto of Derry, and Derry Republican Committee Chair Jim Foley. Foley's election efforts were put in jeopardy Friday when the New Hampshire Union Leader reported that he has past legal problems.Mark Evans, an acupuncturist and former city councilor in Berlin, is running for the Republican nomination in District 1, with plans to challenge Democratic incumbent Jeff Woodburn. Dorothy McPhaul, of Sugar Hill, is waging a write-in campaign for the GOP nomination in the state's northern-most district, having been inspired to run to oppose the Northern Pass electrical power transmission project.Another write-in candidate hopes to make it on to the general election ballot in District 16, Democrat Maureen Raiche Manning of Manchester, whose family has been in state Democratic politics for decades, seeks the post.Education, environment, health care, job creation and the Northern Pass are some of the many issues candidates are talking about on the campaign trail.The increase in the state's gas tax by 4.2 cents a gallon is cited by a number of Senate candidates, including Evans, and Cormier and Kenda, whose primary opponents voted for the gas tax increase.Medicaid expansion or the state's NH Health Protection Program under the Affordable Care Act is also a concern and also why the three incumbents face Republican challengers.\-----\NH State Senate Primary\(* denotes incumbent)\District 1\Republican: Mark Evans of Berlin, Dorothy McPhaul of Sugar Hill (write-in)Democrat: Jeff Woodburn of Dalton*District 2Republican: Jeanie Forrester of Meredith* and Timothy Condon of GraftonDemocrat: Carolyn Mello of HoldernessDistrict 3Republican: Jeb Bradley of Wolfeboro*Democrat: John R.

My name is Kathy Rago, and I am running for state Senate in District 7 because I believe our state government needs capable people willing to provide careful fiscal analysis and make tough decisions.
\
As an accountant and CPA, former state representative and a mom of three great kids, I know how important it is to create a careful budget and live within our means.
\
New Hampshire stands on the precipice of another $100 million shortfall due to overspending in Concord. Since 2006, we have not only had three Democratic majorities but also severe overspending problems.
\
Increasing the gas tax and other fees to try to offset this out-of-control spending is not right, and our taxpayers deserve better. Who will look out for the working families that are already struggling and hold Concord accountable? I will.
\
The first thing we will need to do is introduce careful cost reductions in all departments to stem the bleeding. But soon after, we will need to take actions to jump-start our economy to build a welcoming business environment, grow jobs and get us out of this awful stagnation.
\
We need to cut business taxes, reduce or eliminate burdensome regulations without jeopardizing safety or our environment, get our energy costs under control and stop wasteful spending.
\
I ask for your vote on Nov. 4 so we can once again place an ""Open for Business"" sign in New Hampshire.

119,"RECENTLY FORMER state Supreme Court Chief Justice John Broderick Jr. opined on this page that, regarding the New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS), it would ""not be fair or just to change the rules after the game begins."" His metaphor of a ""game"" is actually quite apt. Games and plans change as information and circumstances change, and since that is the current case with the NHRS, it needs to do the same.The State of New Hampshire has one of the lowest-rated retirement systems in the country (it is underfunded by $4.5 billion). When the near financial collapse of the country happened in 2008-2009, many of the ""rules"" were modified to keep the country itself financially afloat. We need action now to resolve the NHRS mess.Many people in the private sector have lost jobs they will never get back. Private pension systems have gone bankrupt and individuals have lost all of their saved retirement benefits. There are virtually no defined benefit plans (annuities) any more in the private sector. They have all been converted to defined contribution plans (DCP). A DCP would have the advantage for the municipalities and other governments to know exactly how much they will have to pay each year (no million-dollar bills arriving on the doorstep from the state). Individuals have total control over their money, and can take 100 percent of it with them if they move from job to job.How did the NHRS get into this financial mess?Years of largesse by both parties and self-serving individuals on the retirement committee(s) at the state level have brought us to this brink. Projected rates of return on the investments that were (and are) to ""cover"" this expense were not modified as it became apparent they were not valid.The state ""promised"" to fund 35 percent of this cost to the individual towns. That 35 percent has dwindled to zero percent. Last year the Town of Bedford received a $1 million bill from the state to partially cover this shortfall. Larger bills are expected in the future, as the state continues to be unable under the current ""rules"" to make that 35 percent reimbursement to towns. The state's operating reserves are considered extremely low at about 3 percent of revenues, and the pension system is roughly 57 percent funded, among the lowest levels of any state.How often do we see the state (read: those we elect) set aside the law when it is ""expedient?"" By law, all of the gasoline taxes the state collects are to be used for maintenance and repair of the roads and bridges in the state. They have not, and never have been. The gas tax ""piggy bank"" gets raided year after year, and now there is an added four cents per gallon tax increase going into effect on July 1. How long will it be before all that new money generated is ""dipped into"" for other causes?Only the federal government has the ability to print money out of thin air to satisfy its thirst to spend. State and local governments receive virtually all of their operating money from the private sector in the form of taxes. As the private sector is financially affected, so is the state.Broderick claims that ""public employees are paid less than their private company employees are."" That is not true, according to an American Enterprise Institute report from April. (Its analysis is restricted to state government workers employed in non-public safety positions, as fire and police skill sets are not generally replicated in the private sector.)Most observers hold that a fairly paid public employee is one who receives salaries, benefits, and job amenities equal in total value to what he or she would likely receive in a private-sector job. New England states pay particularly generous retiree health benefits. In Connecticut, retiree health benefits are equivalent to receiving an additional 18 percent of wages every year of the employee's working life. In Massachusetts, the figure is 18 percent; in New Hampshire it is 19 percent.Public employees have greater protection against layoffs and terminations for cause than private-sector employees do. This greater job security acts as an insurance policy against unemployment. If state government employment offers greater job security, then these positions should pay lower overall compensation than similar private-sector positions.In two categories, physical environment and physical demands, private-sector jobs are less pleasant than state government occupations. In the most generous states, such as California, New Hampshire and New York, annual benefits including accrual of future pension and health entitlements are nearly as valuable as wages. New Hampshire employees enjoy a 6 percent to 10 percent premium total compensation package over their private employee counterparts. (American Enterprise Institute).We believe that all employees, both public and private, should be paid wages and benefits commensurate with their education, job skills, and their employers' ability to pay. No group of employees lives in a vacuum. All, public and private employees, must be willing to adapt to changes in our employment environment and be a part of the overall solution.The Legislature, with strong leadership from the governor, must come to terms with the immense size of the $4.5 billion unfunded obligation and the future consequences of not taking responsible action now. Yes, the solution will be difficult, but ignoring the growing deficit is not an option. Private sector businesses have taken responsible actions to protect both their employees and their stakeholders. New Hampshire has similar responsibilities to our employees and our taxpayers. We anticipate our NHRS vested employees will become willing partners in seeking an equitable solution to our problem..\Ken Peterson, a retired Air Force brigadier general, is chairman of the the Trustees of the Trust Funds in Bedford.

Today, after spending weeks fine-tuning the budget presented to us by Gov. John Lynch, the House Finance Committee will agree on a budget to bring to the floor of the House,
\
The committee has listened to residents across New Hampshire who depend upon the state for essential services and sometimes even for life itself. We have listened to agencies struggling to deliver those essential services.
\
At the very time that citizens need more help from the state, New Hampshire has fewer resources to meet those needs.
\
Our first goal was to try to protect those who have no other option. Our next goal was to try to protect public health, safety and the environment.
\
It brings little comfort to know that nearly every state in the Union is in the same boat, and that we are in better shape than many of our sister states.
\
The federal stimulus program offers significant opportunities for New Hampshire residents to benefit directly and indirectly, for example - the weatherization program that creates jobs in the short-term and reduces energy dependence in the long term. It is a valuable program, indeed, but no help to us in terms of the state budget.
\
The governor's budget left many valuable and innovative programs on the cutting room floor. We have, nonetheless, been able to address some needs that had not been in the budget or had been funded at a lower level.
\
We decided to:
\
- Return rooms and meals revenue to cities and towns;
\
- Fully fund education adequacy according to the formula approved by the General Court in the last session;
\
- Provide additional money to cities and towns, the Department of Resources and Economic Development and Fish and Game Department, and as a result of inclusion of the gas tax in the budget;
\
- Support Family Resource Centers which assist at-risk families.
\
- Support Senior Volunteers, Foster Grandparents and RSVP - programs that provide assistance to seniors and school children;
\
- Support the Catastrophic Illness Program, which provides minimal assistance to those with serious illnesses;
\
- Fund family planning at the maintenance level;
\
- Provide funding for AIDS services organizations;
\
- Increase funding for programs to divert at-risk youths from the juvenile system;
\
- Fund the Governor's Commission on Drug and Alcohol programs at the 2009 level, and
\
- Fund the Comprehensive Cancer Plan at 25 percent of maintenance level.
\
It is not over yet.
\
After Tuesday's committee vote, the budget will go to the floor of the House on April 8. From there, it will go to the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate will have two more months to adjust revenue estimates based on new information and to put its stamp on the budget before we meet near the end of the session to iron out differences.

121,"
Kelly Ayotte, New Hampshire's junior senator, has set an example that other Republicans would be well-served to follow. In repeated votes on the Senate floor last week, she reaffirmed her belief in man-made climate change, and by extension the importance of tending to our environment. Given the rabidly anti-science bias currently infecting her party, those votes are refreshing.
\
We have the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline project to thank. As the U.S. Senate considered a bill approving the pipeline last week, Democrats offered amendments meant to put Republicans on the spot. Senators were asked whether they believed climate change was real and whether they believed human activity played a significant role in it.
\
Ayotte first voted for an amendment affirming that climate change was real. In that vote, she was joined by all the senators, Democrat and Republican, with the exception of Mississippi Republican Roger Wicker. But believing that the climate can change isn't the same as believing that humans caused that change or should be responsible for addressing it. So Democrats offered another amendment, noting the ""human activity significantly contributes"" to the change. Ayotte voted for that amendment, too, splitting with most of her party. The only Republicans who joined her were Susan Collins of Maine, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.
\
The GOP offered a weak-tea version of that second amendment, omitting the word ""significantly,"" but even that revision attracted only 15 votes from the party. Ayotte voted for it, too.
\
This isn't necessarily a new position for the senator. The Monitor reported back in 2009 that she called climate change a ""real issue,"" although in a 2010 debate among GOP Senate candidates she suggested it wasn't proven. Last year, she was one of only three Republicans voting to advance a bill from New Hampshire's senior senator, Jeanne Shaheen, to encourage energy efficiency.
\
While it's been suggested her recent votes were politically calculated, the record says that Ayotte has, somewhat hesitantly, been consistent. The real question she must answer, along with other Republicans acknowledging the overwhelming scientific consensus on the issue, is what we do next. Her votes on the pipeline itself, for example, are not encouraging. It's difficult to see how a project transporting hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil a day could possibly help the situation.
\
Bills encouraging private and public investments in alternative energy, such as wind and solar, would be a good start. Ayotte might also want to take a look at the federal gas tax, which hasn't been raised in 20 years. A sizable increase, especially in this time of low gas prices, could both help boost gas mileage and repair our aging infrastructure.
\
Ayotte hasn't yet shown herself committed to taking the steps necessary to slow or stop the catastrophic warming of our planet, but at least she's acknowledged that we have a problem. Let's hope that her recent votes aren't the end of her engagement with the issue but only the beginning.

122,".Words of advice: Kimon Koulet says the state must address its aging transportation system if it wants to remain competitive in the region.\MEREDITH As Kimon Koulet retires from the post of executive director of the Lakes Region Planning Commission, he leaves state planners and legislators a message: Invest in infrastructure needs.\""We must continue to focus on transportation planning, including multi-modal options, and other infrastructure needs,"" said Koulet, who leaves after 30 years at the commission.\""The state needs to reconcile the difference between transportation needs and adequate funding for projects. The (state Department of Transportation) commissioner has been sounding the alarm about the need for more funding to avoid major impacts to the DOT in less than two years.""\New Hampshire, he said, is falling behind its neighbors.\""The states around us have already raised their gas tax to help ensure their transportation systems are maintained. New Hampshire has not adjusted it in 23 years,"" he said. ""Infrastructure is essential to sustain our economy and to attract economic growth.""\And regionally, there are road and building projects that need the state's attention.\""The Lakes Region has millions of dollars of documented needs for at least the next 20 years,"" he said.\Koulet came to the LRPC after working as planning director of the Northwest Colorado Council of Governments, program manager in the executive director's office of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources and as a planning consultant in Colorado Springs, Colo.\The commission was formed in 1968 in response to community concerns about increased signs of water pollution on the lakes due to development pressures. The commission operated without an office or staff until 1971, when 12 communities appropriated funds to hire staff and implement a planning program.\Like other regional planning commissions, the group has helped in an advisory role towns and regions plan and prepare for the future. A voluntary association of local municipalities, it offers low-cost, quality professional planning services, providing expertise in a variety of areas such as land use, transportation and environmental planning.\During Koulet's time at the commission, ""there have been many satisfying accomplishments, both small and large,"" he said.\The commission played an important role in helping the region's communities to develop master plans. It also helped establish multiple regional household hazardous waste collections that have removed hundreds of thousands of gallons of toxic chemicals from the environment.\In the 1990s, transportation planning grew in importance, Koulet said. One of the landmark commission studies was the preparation of the Route 3-Route 11 Corridor Study between Franklin and Laconia.\""There were 28 public meetings and workshops in 12 months leading to several priority recommendations that resulted in millions of dollars of roadway improvements,"" he said.\Koulet will be replaced by Jeff Hayes, who is expected to start work this month. A New Hampshire native, Hayes comes from the North Country Council, where he worked for many years, Koulet said.\Hayes has a lot on his plate in his new role. The LRPC is preparing the Lakes Region Plan, a comprehensive plan that will reflect the vision and priorities of the region's communities. A draft will be completed by summer, and a final version will be voted on by the commission by the end of 2014.\The Lakes Region Plan ""will be a tremendous resource for local planning boards to use when updating their local master plans. It will identify regional challenges, offer policy recommendations and provide an array of information and references on everything from housing and transportation to hazard mitigation and a sustainable economy; in short, a road map for the future,"" Koulet said.\dseufert@newstote.com"
123,"NEW HAMPSHIRE'S STATE GAS TAX is currently set at 22.2 cents per gallon. This price is slightly less than the 24 cents per gallon paid in Massachusetts and much less than the 30 cents per gallon paid in Maine. With the exception of the 4.2 cents per gallon increase in 2014, New Hampshire's tax on gasoline has remained relatively flat over the years.The Department of Transportation, along with a number of departments and agencies, rely upon this source of revenue in order to support daily operations; however, with the increasing numbers of fuel efficient and electric vehicles, the department's operating revenue has decreased.Some vehicles are simply traveling farther on the same amount of gas; therefore, less gas is being used. This is a win for the consumer and environment, but decreasing revenue is counter-productive to highway and bridge maintenance.In an effort to remedy the revenue issue, there appears to be an effort by several states to pursue a study of a mileage-based tax. Rather than being taxed for gas used, drivers would be taxed on miles driven. The mileage-based tax concept presents a whole host of bothersome issues such as financial hardship to those dependent upon high volume highway use and for all, privacy issues regarding how the government would collect and track data.Accordingly, it is somewhat shocking to learn that a federal grant application was submitted by the Delaware DOT on behalf of the I-95 Corridor Coalition, a consortium of 16 states. It proposes pilot programs in five states Connecticut, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and another yet to be determined designed to learn more about mileage-based user fees, and to evaluate implementation alternatives.The total cost of the grant program is $2.98 million, of which $1.49 million comes from the federal government, with the remainder coming from individual states with matching funds. Connecticut has committed $300,000, Delaware and Pennsylvania would each pay $290,000 in cash, and Vermont would contribute $30,000 for planning and analysis. Instead of cash, the pilot program application reflects New Hampshire's match share in the amount of $580,000 in toll credits.Can New Hampshire afford to redirect more than a half-million dollars of toll credits needed for road maintenance and red-listed bridges in order to support a fee-per-mile taxation study?The state budget-making process is built upon prioritizing needs and doing so through an open, transparent process involving public input. Redirecting toll revenue midstream during a budget cycle is contrary to that process and invites needed legislative oversight.Mileage-based taxation generates a number of serious issues, of which protection of personal information and data is foremost. How is Big Brother going to obtain data identifying miles driven, and will this information remain protected and confidential?If a scheme such as this does move forward, how will the state ascertain taxable miles driven in New Hampshire versus miles driven in another state or country? If mileage-based taxation becomes reality, how will North Country residents be impacted where traveling longer distances is required for work or other daily needs?And, if a fee-per-mile study becomes reality in New Hampshire, how would this taxation scheme apply to vacationers from out-of-state?Learning about the I-95 Coalition fee-per-mile study application and of New Hampshire's decision to pilot the program with $580,000 from state toll credits is unsettling to this member of the Legislature.\.\Rep.

125,"
Republican businessman Walter Havenstein announced his intention to run for governor yesterday, giving Republicans new hope in their mission to take back the governor's mansion this fall.
\
But Democrats quickly attempted to halt any momentum by questioning whether Havenstein is legally eligible to run because he received a tax break designed for state residents on a condo he owned in Maryland several years ago.
\
Havenstein, 64, is the former chief executive officer of BAE Systems Inc., the state's largest manufacturing employer. He's been a major donor in Republican circles for years, but this is his first run for elected office. He filed paperwork to form a campaign committee yesterday and plans to make a formal announcement in two weeks.
\
""Our state is at a critical juncture, and I believe my experience, ideas, and leadership are what is needed to address the many challenges facing New Hampshire,"" he said in a statement. He was not available for further comment.
\
Although Democrats were quick to raise questions about Havenstein's eligibility to run, his adviser, Jamie Burnett, said yesterday that Havenstein is eligible to run based on New Hampshire law.
\
At this time, the New Hampshire Democratic Party has no plans to legally challenge Havenstein's eligibility, Communications Director Julie McClain said. But, she said, Havenstein has important questions to answer about his eligibility and tax payments.
\
Is he eligible?
\
State law says a gubernatorial candidate must be domiciled in New Hampshire for the seven years leading up to his or her candidacy. Domicile is defined as the primary place where someone has established a physical presence and intends to hold a continuous presence there for domestic, social and civil purposes. People can leave the state temporarily yet still consider themselves domiciled here.
\
Havenstein and his wife, Judy, moved to New Hampshire in 1999 and own a home in Alton. He has been registered to vote here since at least 2004, according to the Secretary of State's office. Havenstein did own a condo in Bethesda, Md., for several years beginning in 2008, when he was transferred there for his job with BAE Systems, Burnett said.
\
His work remained in Maryland when he left BAE Systems and became chief executive officer of Science Applications International Corp. While employed full time in Maryland, Havenstein lived there during the week and traveled home to Alton on the weekends, Burnett said. Havenstein retired from SAIC in 2011 and sold his Maryland property.
\
Under Maryland law, anyone who is in the state for more than 183 days a year is considered a statutory resident for income tax purposes. Maryland law acknowledges that someone may be a resident in Maryland for tax purposes yet domiciled somewhere else.
\
Democrats are saying that if Havenstein was domiciled in New Hampshire, making him eligible to run for governor, he falsely received a tax credit on his Maryland property. Maryland homeowners are eligible for a ""homestead exemption"" on their property taxes if they fill out a form declaring a piece of property as their principal residence.
\
Maryland law defines ""principal"" residence as the ""one dwelling where the homeowner regularly resides and is the location designated by the owner for the legal purposes of voting, obtaining a driver's license, and filing income tax returns.""
\
It is unclear from the application whether someone must meet each piece of this criteria to be eligible. A representative from Maryland's Department of Assessments and Taxation did not return a message asking for comment clarifying the requirements for receiving the exemption.
\
Challenges to a candidate's eligibility can be filed through the New Hampshire Ballot Law Commission once the candidate signs an affidavit placing his or her name on the ballot in June.
\
In a 2000 case, the commission found a Democratic candidate for state senator was eligible to run even though he had lived in and been registered to vote in California within the seven years leading up to his candidacy. The candidate, Leonard Foy, had lived in California for work and employment purposes, and the ballot commission ruled he was eligible to run because he had always intended to return to New Hampshire. After that ruling, however, the Legislature enacted a law saying registering to vote in another state would remove someone's domicile in New Hampshire.
\
Havenstein never registered to vote in Maryland during the time he lived there for work.
\
Strong business ties
\
Despite these questions from Democrats, Republicans expressed excitement yesterday over Havenstein's decision to enter the race. Andrew Hemingway, 31, is the other Republican candidate in the primary.
\
Havenstein is a candidate with deep pockets and a strong business background, both of which will make him a serious contender in the primary and the general election, Republican strategist Jim Merrill said. Both Havenstein and Scott Brown, who is likely to run for U.S. Senate, will have to fight through primaries, but the potential of a GOP ticket topped by Havenstein and Brown this fall will draw national eyes and money to New Hampshire from groups such as the Republican Governors Association and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Merrill said.
\
""Their interest in New Hampshire has certainly spiked in the last 48 hours,"" he said.
\
The New Hampshire Republican Party does not take a position in primaries, but said Gov. Maggie Hassan's support for the Affordable Care Act and an increase in the gas tax will make her vulnerable this fall.
\
Burnett, Havenstein's adviser, said Havenstein's executive experience in the business world makes him a strong candidate to lead the state.
\
""This race is about leadership and the ability to create a competitive environment for job growth. New Hampshire is at an economic crossroads, and this campaign will be about who is best suited to ensure that this state remains a great place in which to live, work and raise a family,"" he said.

New state laws taking effect today give livestock in California more living room, approve direct-to-consumer wine shipments in Massachusetts and levy the ultimate punishment on wannabe teen drivers in Nevada by denying them licenses if they skip too much school.
\
Other laws will allow trained school personnel in Tennessee to administer insulin, let Louisiana teens as young as 16 register to vote, crack down on meth dealers in Michigan, end tax breaks for Hollywood in North Carolina and raise the minimum wage in Ohio, New York, Rhode Island and elsewhere.
\
Although it doesn't take effect until early February, a New York law captures this year's ""Who knew?"" prize by banning tiger selfies, which have been used by young men as profile photos on social media sites.
\
A look at some of the new laws taking effect today:
\
------
\
ALCOHOL
\
Wine connoisseurs will be popping the cork over a new law taking effect Thursday that allows out-of-state wineries to ship bottles directly to consumers in Massachusetts. The drive for direct wine shipments had been stalled for years before getting a big boost from former New England Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe. Now a winemaker in Washington state, Bledsoe complained to lawmakers he could not send his products to Massachusetts residents, including fans and former teammates like current Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.
\
------
\
ANIMALS
\
In California, a ballot initiative approved by voters in 2008 takes effect restricting the confinement of egg-laying hens, breeding sows and veal calves. The Humane Society of the United States says the law goes further than any in the country when coupled with a law signed by former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger that extends the space requirements for egg-laying hens to out-of-state suppliers.
\
In Utah, cities and towns can no longer ban specific dog breeds within their limits. At least 10 cities now have restrictions that ban ownership of breeds such as pit bulls.
\
------
\
CRIME
\
In California, a ""yes means yes"" standard for sex between college students takes effect, requiring ""an affirmative, conscious and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity,"" meaning silence or a lack of resistance can no longer be deemed consent.
\
In Michigan, rape evidence may be better organized and tracked under laws designed to help ensure kits aren't caught in the sort of backlog found when more than 11,000 untested boxes were discovered in a Detroit Police storage facility in 2009.
\
In Louisiana, law enforcement agencies must provide a tally of the number of untested rape kits on their shelves by Thursday, part of a law that took effect in August.
\
In Tennessee, ex-felons who have turned their lives around can now receive a certificate of employability, which gives businesses who hire such individuals protection from negligent hiring lawsuits.
\
------
\
DRUG ABUSE
\
In Michigan, buying cough and cold medicines for the purpose of making methamphetamine will be illegal under another series of measures intended to crack down on meth makers. The laws also prohibit asking someone to buy the ingredients and require state police to add meth offenders to a national database.
\
------
\
ELECTIONS
\
In Louisiana, 16- and 17-year-olds will be able to register to vote when obtaining a driver's license, though they still won't be able to vote until they turn 18.
\
In North Carolina, individuals filing as a candidate in a party primary must have had an affiliation with that party for at least 90 days before filing a candidacy notice.
\
A Delaware law establishes new rules for allocating campaign contributions among joint account holders, such as when spouses submit a political contribution using a single check.
\
------
\
ENVIRONMENT
\
In North Carolina, home sellers will have to disclose whether they know if underground oil and gas rights have been sold.
\
In New York State, consumers must begin recycling old computers, televisions and video game consoles instead of throwing them in the trash.
\
In the face of a three-year drought, new California laws require water districts and other local entities to develop plans to manage their groundwater and allow the state to intervene if necessary.
\
------
\
HEALTH
\
Tennessee joins more than 20 states adding insulin to medications that school staff may volunteer to be trained to administer. Proponents said it will help in an era of dwindling school nurses, while opponents say only someone with a medical background should give insulin in case something unexpected happens.
\
In Louisiana, smoking will be banned within 25 feet of public entrances to state office buildings, as a way to lessen exposure to secondhand smoke.
\
------
\
HUNTING
\
In North Carolina, the state Wildlife Resources Commission faces new restrictions on how high it can raise fees on hunting, fishing and trapping licenses. Starting with the new year, the fees can't be raised beyond a widely used measure of inflation averaged over the previous five years.
\
------
\
MOTOR VEHICLES
\
In California, drivers' licenses will be available for people in the country illegally.
\
In Nevada, students who are declared habitually truant could be delayed from obtaining a driver's license, or could have their license suspended.
\
In Florida, all children aged 4 and 5 will be required to sit in a child safety seat or booster seat instead of using just a car seat belt.
\
In Indiana, license plates will be required on motor scooters for the first time following complaints about unsafe driving by those who've lost their licenses because of drunken driving arrests or other offenses.
\
In Michigan, lawmakers closed a loophole so motorcyclists can no longer buy a temporary permit every riding season without taking a safety or skills test needed for a full endorsement.
\
Massachusetts will finally allow ""hold open"" clips on pumps at self-service gasoline stations, ending motorists' complaints -- particularly in winter -- about being in one of the few states where the clips weren't allowed.
\
In Utah, police will be required to impound the vehicles of uninsured drivers instead of just having the option to do so.
\
------
\
SOCIAL MEDIA
\
In New York in February, it becomes illegal to pose for a photo with a lion, tiger or other big cat. The measure, which specifically prohibits contact between members of the public and big cats at animal shows, passed after self-portraits with the animals started becoming more popular online, particularly with some young men on dating sites.
\
------
\
TAXES
\
In North Carolina, Republican lawmakers who approved an income tax cut also took away breaks to Hollywood and cab drivers. Expiring is a 25 percent tax credit for TV and film productions that in 2013 allowed producers to forego paying $61 million in state taxes. It's being replaced in 2015 by a grant program for video productions capped at $10 million.
\
In Virginia, drivers can expect to see a 5 cents-per-gallon increase in the cost of gas, while Maryland's gas tax is set to rise about 3.5 cents.
\
In Mississippi, totally disabled veterans and their surviving spouses who have not remarried would not have to pay property taxes on their primary residence.
\
------
\
VETERANS
\
In Nebraska, vets and the spouses of fully disabled veterans will receive a hiring preference when applying for jobs in state or local government.
\
------
\
WAGES
\
The minimum wage goes up Thursday in several states, including Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Maryland, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. A wage increase in New York takes effect Wednesday. In addition, troopers in Oklahoma get their first pay raise in seven years.
\
------
\
WEAPONS
\
In Pennsylvania on Jan. 5, a law takes effect that's designed to give the National Rifle Association, or any gun owner, a better chance at successfully challenging local firearms ordinances in court. In general, Pennsylvania bars its municipalities from enforcing firearms ordinances that are stronger than state law. But the NRA has complained that dozens of local ordinances go unchallenged in Pennsylvania courts by residents who can prove it harmed them.
\
In California, law enforcement agencies are required to develop policies that encourage officers to search the state's database of gun purchases as part of routine welfare checks. The bill was prompted by sheriff's deputies' failure to detect the danger posed by a man who weeks later embarked on a deadly rampage in May near the University of California, Santa Barbara.
\
------
\
WELFARE
\
In Tennessee, as part of welfare eligibility, a parent or guardian with a child struggling in a school must attend two or more conferences with the teacher within a year to review the child's status.

127,". Hike proposed: If Massachusetts increases its income tax, the New Hampshire Advantage will only get bigger, state leaders say.\Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick's call for a hike in his state's already-high income tax is being welcomed on this side of the border with bipartisan open arms.\""Welcome to New Hampshire!"" was the reaction of Wolfeboro Republican and state Senate Majority Leader Jeb Bradley.\""We should be putting up billboards,"" he said. ""We have long marketed New Hampshire's attractiveness as a place to do business for precisely this reason.\""I think there are going to be a lot of people there who say that enough is enough and find New Hampshire much more attractive as a result of this.""\Gov. Maggie Hassan's reaction to a fellow Democrat and New England governor was more tempered, but carried the same message.\""I appreciate that Massachusetts has its own unique challenges and Governor Patrick has to choose his own approach in meeting those,"" she told the Sunday News. ""But if that approach leads to an economic boost for us, then I welcome it.""\Hassan reiterated her campaign promise to veto income or sales tax legislation should it reach her desk.\""That's because I understand that our economy is based around not having a broadbased tax, and I think the tax would hurt middle class families and our businesses,"" she said.\Patrick's proposal would hike the Massachusetts personal income tax from 5.25 to 6.25 as part of a $1.9 billion plan for new transportation and education spending. It will soon go to a legislature dominated by Democrats.\It prompted Boston Magazine editor Patrick Doyle to write that after some tax reductions in recent years, his state is about to re-earn its nickname: ""Taxachusetts.""\Patrick has called for doubling the personal exemption from $4,400 to $8,800 for all taxpayers. But he also wants to eliminate many itemized deductions, apparently to have the burden of the hike fall on wealthier Bay State workers.\He also called for a cut in his state's sales tax, a more regressive tax that hits the poor harder than the rich, from 6.25 to 4.5 percent.\New Hampshire's Bradley was unimpressed.\""Until their sales tax rate goes down to zero, I don't think it's going to do much for them,"" he said.\Patrick also wants to tie gas tax hikes to the rate of inflation to raise more than $100 million through the end of the decade.\Michael Bergeron, business development manager at the New Hampshire Department of Resources and Economic Development, said the Patrick income tax proposal will ""absolutely"" be used in his pitch to out-of-state businesses looking to move or expand.\""At least 60 percent of our leads come from Massachusetts,"" he said. ""And we love it when Massachusetts does what they're good at.""\According to information released by the Massachusetts Office of Administration and Finance, an individual earning $50,000-a-year will see his income tax slightly drop due to the higher exemption, but someone making $80,000 annually should expect a tax hike of about $600, to $4,450. An individual earning $120,000 will see his income tax bill go up by about $1,000 to $6,950.\A family of four earning $80,000 would see its tax go up by about $600 to $3,775. The tax on a family of four at $160,000 jumps by about $1,600 to $8,775 and a family of four at $180,000 will have an income tax hike of about $1,200 to $10,150.\Along for the tax hike ride are about 88,000 Granite State residents who work in Massachusetts, according to that state's Department of Revenue. They paid $256.4 million in Massachusetts personal income taxes in 2009, the latest year available on the department's web site.\The number of New Hampshire residents who work in Massachusetts fluctuates. According to data compiled by the American Community Survey of the U.S. Census Bureau and cited for this report by a New Hampshire Department of Employment Security economist, the average number of Granite Staters who worked in Mass from 2010 through 2012 was 81,295.\The thousands of Massachusetts residents who work in New Hampshire must also pay the Massachusetts income tax, according to Dennis Delay, economist at the Center for Public Policy Studies.\At least one Bay State businessman says he is not worried about the Patrick tax hikes.\""We believe businesses actually have a lower cost of doing business in Massachusetts than moving to New Hampshire,"" said Joseph Bevilacqua, president of the Massachusetts Economic Development Council and the Merrimack Valley Chamber of Commerce in Lawrence.\""We hear to a great degree the most critical component is an available work force,"" Bevilacqua said, ""and we're told that businesses find the quality employees they need on the Massachusetts side of the border.""\""We're not taking a position on the governor's recommendations,"" he said. ""We're simply saying that in concept, business does business better in Massachusetts and uses Massachusetts better as a home base for the sales of its products.\""Obviously, no one likes increased taxes,"" Bevilacqua said. But he said Patrick's plans to spend more money on education and infrastructure signals that ""Massachusetts is looking to the future.""\Besides, he said, ""You (New Hampshire) have that business profits tax and some of the highest property taxes in the nation. And New Hampshire knows there is a hammer coming with respect to the funding of education.""\Indeed, not all is rosy in New Hampshire, or at least not as rosy as in the past.\Economist Delay wrote in a report last September the long-heralded ""New Hampshire Advantage"" is not what it once was.\The population increase has stopped; the state is actually losing some residents and the population is aging, he said.\""They are also creating jobs at a faster pace in Massachusetts than we are right now,"" Delay said. ""That has to do with the mix of industry down there. It is centered in high-tech and manufacturing and, proportionally, they have more of that than we do right now.\""We still have a lower tax burden, but our relative advantage has lessened,"" Delay said.\Hassan, however, maintained: ""We've continued to out-perform our neighbors during this recession. Our low-tax policy works.\""In addition to maintaining our low-tax environment, which is critical to our economy and to the New Hampshire advantage, we also have to focus on our other advantages, too, which are a highly educated work force, a remarkably accessible and open government, our natural resources and our high quality of life,"" the governor said.\She noted that she has told agency heads to submit budgets that are 3 percent lower than in the current fiscal year.\""We are very focused on having as lean a budget as possible,"" she said. ""I also have been supporting one high-end, highly-regulated casino. I think that's a really practical and positive way of raising revenues.""\She said the 10 cents-a-pack cut in the cigarette tax cut made in the current budget should be eliminated to produce about $20 million.\Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire President Jim Roche and PolEcon Research economist Brian Gottlob agreed that the Patrick plan, if passed into law, would help New Hampshire's competitive advantage, but to what degree, Gottlob said, is unclear.\Lowering the Massachusetts sales tax ""probably will have benefit to households here,"" he said, ""but I don't think it's going to have much of an impact in terms of retail sales here in New Hampshire. There is a certain connotation to being able to say, 'We're tax free,' rather than just being able to say, 'We're marginally lower than Maine.'""\[Caption]"

One of the city's smallest wards, it covers the law school and NHTI, a major office park, White Park, downtown, and a mix of single-family homes and apartments.\Such a diverse area comes with a variety of perks and challenges, and all three candidates have slightly different views on the best way to handle them.\Whoever wins will fill the seat left empty by new At-Large City Councilor Byron Champlin until November.\If you don't know them, allow us to introduce your candidates:\Edith Chiasson \Age: 59\Family: Ron Chiasson, blended family of eight children and several grandchildren\Occupation: Auditor for New Hampshire Lottery Commission\Prior public office held: None\Favorite thing about Ward 4: Proximity to downtown, parks\Edith Chiasson has lived in Concord for 33 years, but it took a proposed price hike to her street's residential parking permit for her to find her voice.\Last year, the city proposed raising the permit costs for street parking on Essex, Blanchard and Rowell streets and Perry Avenue from $5 to $50. But they kept the permits at $5 after residents spoke out against the change.\Chiasson said she led the charge after the changes took her and others by surprise, going door to door and encouraging people to speak to the city.\“Our piece was one teeny bit of a 40-page section,” she said, referring to the city's sweeping parking system changes implemented last year. “So we missed it, my neighbors missed it.”\The process inspired her to run when the Ward 4 seat opened up. “The way I see it, I spent my life voting for people who will represent me, and I rely on that representative to have my interests in mind,” Chiasson said.\“I got involved because I realized I have a voice that is very much like the people around me,” she continued.\Chiasson may have never run for public office before, but she thinks her years of working in the financial sector and eight years in the New Hampshire Lottery Commission, as well as years of volunteering at St. Peter's and now St. John the Evangelist churches, make her a good candidate for the job.\Chiasson is concerned with the city's tight housing market, pointing to her neighborhood's mix of elderly residents, young families and law school students renting rooms as an example of where more options need to be available.\“I think the housing has gotten a little out of control in terms of pricing,” she said. Chaisson said the city should consider working with developers whose projects may have stalled – like Harold Ekstrom's elderly housing project on Warren Street – to help make projects viable.\Chiasson said her ward's narrow streets and older buildings also pose a challenge, especially when it comes to parking. She said she thinks the city did its best to alleviate the parking issues on some narrow streets surrounding White Park and the law school but said the situation should be monitored to see if it's working.\In terms of broader city challenges, Chiasson said the Interstate 93 widening project will certainly change the way the city's traffic flow moves – and that it's up to Concord to keep an open dialogue with the state.\The state's aging population concerns Chaisson, as it means more residents qualify for elderly tax exemptions, she said.\John Cook \Age: 74\Family: Brother and sister in Ohio, partner Jane Brezosky\Occupation: Landlord\Prior public office held: None; ran twice for mayor, in 2011 and 2013\Favorite thing about Ward 4: How diverse it is\If there's extra money to be found, John Cook says he can find it.\That's what Cook, a Concord resident of 42 years, who has done financial work for the state's health and welfare departments and the now-closed Laconia State School, and has done auditing work for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, thinks makes him the best candidate for Ward 4.\“I'd always find money,” he said of his past experiences. “They don't want me looking at the budget at city hall.”\Describing himself as a “budget conservative,” Cook said he is concerned by the effect increasing property taxes have on the elderly in the state, saying the city's tax rate has increased faster than retirement benefits.\But he also said city administration “does a good job managing a complex city” that includes state hospitals and prisons along with non-taxable nonprofits.\Cook said he would like the city to explore ways to shift some of the tax burden to people who come from outside the city, saying the high amount of traffic that comes into the city due to its state capital status means the city focuses its snow removal and paving efforts more centrally.\That means residents “get our services last and pay for them first,” Cook said. He suggested either a gas tax or a “head tax” to help with the burden.\Locally, Cook said he is concerned not so much about parking in Ward 4, but snow management. He said the city plows “relocate” snow into people's driveways, making it difficult for people to shovel out during the winter months.\Cook also wants to boost turnout in local elections, especially among young residents. “We need to stir the young people to vote,” he said.\Meredith Hatfield \Age: 51\Family: Lulu, rescue dog; parents live elsewhere in New Hampshire\Occupation: Senior attorney at New Hampshire Conservation Law Foundation\Prior public office held: Concord Energy and Environment Committee; Hopkinton Recycling Committee\Favorite thing about Ward 4: Access to White Park, neighborhood feel\Meredith Hatfield has lived in Concord since 2004, but only became a Ward 4 resident by accident.\Her neighborhood was one of those incorporated into the ward a few years ago when the city redefined the ward lines. But the change suits her neighborhood, she said, and when the Ward 4 seat opened up, she saw it as a chance to fulfill a lifelong dream of public service.\Hatfield said she's already involved in a group of residents who mobilize when there's a major development proposed in the area. One of their successes was to convince the city to install another stop sign on Penacook Street to create a four-way stop; in another instance, the group was vocal about resisting a development at the former site of the Santander Bank (formerly Sovereign Bank) on North State Street.\Hatfield said those experiences defined one of her campaign goals: to explore if notification of major development projects can be expanded beyond abutters so residents can keep up with what's going on in their neighborhoods without having to keep an eye on zoning and planning board agendas.\In addition, Hatfield said her time as the state government consumer advocate at the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission and as the head of the New Hampshire Office of Energy and Planning has also prepared her for the rigors of city government.\It'll be especially useful, she said, as the city navigates how to deal with rising recycling costs.\Locally, Hatfield said her ward faces traffic and parking challenges, noting some of the ward's big streets – Washington and Centre streets, specifically – can be especially hard hit by high traffic volumes and heavy street parking. “It can be a challenge for them to back out of their driveways,” she said.\On a bigger scale, Hatfield said she's keeping an eye on the I-93 widening project and the impact expanding Storrs Street would have on the community.\Hatfield also said she's “blown away” by the cost of housing in Concord and wants to see a mix of housing opportunities come to the city.\Election information \Ward 4's polling location is the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central New Hampshire location at 55 Bradley St. Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.\The ward had about 3,200 registered voters during the March 5 special election, according to city data. Special elections typically see low turnout; during the March 5 special election that included an at-large city council contest, only 227, or 7%, of Ward 4 voters showed up.\"
129,"
They've voted to repeal the death penalty, raise the state's minimum wage and legalize marijuana. They've shot down a casino and attempts to expand gun background checks. They've debated the proper use of welfare benefits and fetal homicide laws.
\
Judging from the headlines, New Hampshire's House of Representatives must be pretty productive, right?
\
Not so fast. The House must send all of its bills to the Senate by Thursday, and lawmakers still have more than 80 to go. Given the pace they've been operating at, Speaker Terie Norelli has scheduled three session days for next week to tackle them all.
\
What's causing this race against the clock? In part, it's due to an excessive use of roll call votes, numerous procedural delays, and long-winded debates on bills that are doomed to fail. In other words, all the things that aren't interesting enough to make headlines in the newspaper.
\
""People are playing a lot of games, and it is more than we've seen in the past,"" said Rep. Gary Richardson, a Hopkinton Democrat. ""There's just been several things that have just gone on endlessly. Some of it is legitimate, where people have genuine questions and that's perfectly acceptable and understandable, but when you get into the procedural maneuvering, challenging rulings of the chair, just all of the minutia of parliamentary games . . .""
\
Some examples: On Thursday, debate on a paint recycling program lasted for two hours, with lawmakers calling for roll call votes four different times on the same bill.
\
The week before, lawmakers spent an hour and a half debating a law about when to turn on car headlights. Multiple times this session, members have initiated lengthy debates opposing unanimous committee recommendations - in other words, efforts they know don't have a chance of succeeding.
\
On the one hand, this is the beauty of New Hampshire's democracy. Every bill gets a public hearing. Every bill gets a debate on the floor if a lawmaker wants it. Every lawmaker can, for the most part, speak for as long as he or she wants.
\
""That's just the nature of the beast,"" said Minority Leader Gene Chandler, a Bartlett Republican.
\
But at what point do these delays become too much?
\
Let's go back to Thursday's debate on the paint recycling bill. The bill established a paint stewardship program meant to give people a safe and easy way to get rid of unused paint cans. After holding a public hearing on the bill, the Environment and Agriculture Committee added an amendment that would allow businesses in the recycling program to add an additional fee, up to $1.60, on the price of those paint cans.
\
Republicans said the committee broke House rules by adding a new fee on the bill without holding another public hearing. Cue the two-hour debate - and much more.
\
First lawmakers stood up to debate the bill.
\
Then the House voted down a motion to table the bill.
\
Then Rep. Steve Vaillancourt, a Manchester Republican, tried to suspend the rules to send the bill back to committee.
\
A Democratic representative stepped in to call for a vote on the amendment, which needed its own vote, which was a roll call.
\
Then, the House voted to accept the amendment - also a roll call.
\
And finally, the House voted to pass the entire bill. That was, of course, a roll call vote.
\
In addition to adding five to 10 minutes onto every vote while lawmakers meander to their seats, roll calls cost money. Each roll call vote is printed out and distributed to the press room and other places around the State House, and each roll call is also printed in the House's end-of-the-year permanent journal. House clerk Karen Wadsworth said she now uses the thinnest paper and the smallest font she can in the permanent journals, and they still take up 1,500 pages by the end of each year. Every House member and individual who wants a print out of the House journal gets one.
\
""My concern is how many pages we are taking up with just these lists and lists and lists,"" Wadsworth said.
\
There are legitimate reasons for calling a roll call: One, it's a way to get lawmakers on record on major issues, which is especially important in an election year. Second, it's a good way for party leaders to ensure their members stay in line.
\
But sometimes they're just used to frustrate or slow down the process. For example, last week former House speaker William O'Brien, a Mont Vernon Republican, asked for a roll call vote on a motion to adjourn for the day.
\
So, going into this week, what can the party leadership do to keep their members in line and the process moving quickly? Majority Leader Steve Shurtleff, a Penacook Democrat, said Democrats are encouraging committee chairs to sit near the front and recommending that people quietly ask them questions about bills before asking on the House floor. Other members can also end lengthy debates by calling for votes.
\
On the Republican side, Chandler said he can't control members who want to speak on bills and doesn't believe in limiting debate. But he hopes people will make their arguments concisely and consider what previous speakers have said.
\
""Eight to nine people speaking on a subject, in my opinion, doesn't do the subject matter any good if you're trying to pass or kill something,"" Chandler said. ""It doesn't help; it might even hurt sometimes.""
\
Will lawmakers heed this message and choose their words wisely next week? If not, it's going to be a very long three days.
\
Ayotte to Ukraine
\
U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, is in Ukraine this weekend with a congressional delegation to meet with government officials, military personnel and others. She'll also be in Israel for a similar mission.
\
""The challenges facing Ukraine and Israel have far-reaching consequences for our national security and peace in the world, and hearing directly from leaders there will inform my work in the Senate,"" she said in a statement. Ayotte is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
\
Ayotte has been a harsh critic of the Obama administration's handling of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Voters in Ukraine's Crimean peninsula passed a referendum last week to become part of Russia, and Russian President Vladimir Putin hasn't backed down on his desire to control the area. The United States has issued economic and travel sanctions against 20 Russians, including Putin's chief of staff.
\
Early last week, when the U.S. hadn't imposed sanctions on Putin's inner circle, Ayotte told the Monitor she wanted President Obama to do more. During the National Republican Leadership Conference in Nashua last weekend she said Putin was playing hardball while Obama was playing T-ball.
\
""We need to hit his inner circle there financially,"" she said.
\
In regards to how the United States should be helping Ukraine, Ayotte said passing an economic aid passage was a crucial step.
\
She doesn't want to see the United States enter into an armed conflict there, but believes the country needs to take strong actions.
\
""The concern is if (Putin) thinks there are no consequences for the invasion of Crimea, we don't know what the next step will be,"" she said.
\
Ayotte will appear on CBS's Face the Nation live from Ukraine this morning at 10:30.
\
What to watch
\
??Both the House and Senate calendars are jam-packed this week, as each chamber need to send all bills to the other by Thursday. The House will convene Tuesday at 10 a.m. and meet again on Wednesday and Thursday. The Senate will meet Thursday at 10 a.m.
\
??Bills of note in the House include the marijuana legalization bill, which the House Ways and Means Committee recommends killing; the Senate's plan to expand access to health insurance through federal Medicaid dollars; and an increase in unemployment benefits.
\
??The Senate will take a final vote on a gas tax increase and may amend a two-casino gambling bill that has been on the table.
\
??Vice President Joe Biden will visit Nashua on Tuesday for an event on workforce development. The White House hasn't released details on the event time and location.
\
??Now more than a week into his listening tour, Scott Brown should make public his decision about whether to enter the U.S. Senate race against Sen. Jeanne Shaheen soon.

130,"NOW THAT rules are in place for the LLC tax, it's time to change it.\Democratic lawmakers last week, over objections of Republicans, adopted final rules for administering the LLC tax.\Senate Majority Leader Maggie Hassan, D-Exeter, said she and others in the Senate want a change.\""The Senate remains concerned about the larger issues surrounding the implementation of this tax and is working diligently to adopt a better policy for the 2010 tax season,"" she said shortly after the rules passed.\The Senate has a bill that all but repeals the tax entirely, along with almost every provision of the Interest and Dividends tax, which is the basis of the LLC tax.\SB 497, sponsored by Sen. Lou D'Allesandro, D-Manchester, and Sen. Bob Odell, R-Lempster, treats business owners pretty generously. They've long been limited in how much they can take in ""reasonable compensation"" before business profits taxes apply to company earnings. Defining reasonable compensation has driven a surge in tax audits at the Department of Revenue Administration, under the direction of a Legislature that gave DRA money for extra auditors.\SB 497 tries to clarify the rule. It says reasonable compensation will be whatever someone reports on a federal income tax return, plus ""personal services provided in connection with the operation and rental of real property, the sale of property and services, and other amounts due to services rendered."" It also uses IRS guidelines on compensation.\Estimates of what the bill costs are wildly divergent, and D'Allesandro argues that it could produce extra revenue. He voted against the budget bill that included the LLC provision.\Sen. Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, who wants to repeal the LLC tax outright, thinks SB 497 will cost the state up to $105 million, on top of the $140 million deficit Gov. John Lynch is working to close.\The DRA itself thinks the bill's impact could be $84 million. The Legislative Budget Assistant thinks its less, in the $60 million range.\A work session on Thursday will bring the experts in to kick the numbers around.\""We'll try to pin it down,"" D'Allesandro said, ""what it costs, or how much it produces in revenue, which would be kind of interesting in light of what everybody is saying."" Bob Clegg, lobbyist and former state senator, said he thinks the bill creates more loopholes for the state's big LLCs. The reform is backed by the biggest developers in the state, including members of the Nash and Tamposi families. D'Allesandro said there's no way that happens.\The House Ways and Means Committee has its own version of reasonable compensation. It sets it at $50,000, no questions asked, and leaves people free to convince DRA their pay ought to be higher. The bill, HB 1523, also takes DRA Commissioner Kevin Clougherty's advice and adopts federal guidelines contained in IRS code.\.\I-93 LONG HAUL: The widening of I-93 continues, but don't expect to see the cranes pull away anytime soon. Latest projections are the full project will be done around 2020.\The two big holdups involve money, like a shortfall of $250 million, and environment, namely the need to cut in half the amount of highway salt that flows into local brooks and streams.\The money is in place to handle all the work that needs doing between Salem and Exit 3 in Windham, and interchange work and some bridges north of that to Manchester.\But only one new lane will be paved in each direction until the salt problem is solved.\Jeff Brillhart, assistant commissioner of Transportation, said the solution is not just at DOT, but it also involves communities, private developers, even parking lots. ""It's not a simple thing to solve,"" he said, noting environmental officials are involved.\The project is still on track to cost $780 million, enough to complete the nearly 20 mile project, and pave two new lanes in each direction whenever salt issues are settled.\Finding the $250 million is the challenge. Gov. John Lynch threatened to veto a gas tax when it was gaining steam last year. The House is on record opposing the use of existing tolls. The state is still working on its application to set up tolls in Salem, despite the outcry form Salem merchants and officials. Bonding the money is another possibility.\Rep. David Campbell, D-Nashua, said doing nothing won't work.\-I-93 is not going to happen unless there is more revenue from some source. Not four lanes in 10 years from Manchester to Salem. That's not a political statement, it's a financial statement,"" he said.\.\LYNCH AND LAGO: Olympic bronze medal snowboarder Scott Lago of Seabrook is invited to the State House once he gets back from Vancouver. Lago came in third in the half-pipe competition last week in the event that saw Shaun White take the gold medal.\Gov. Lynch called Lago to congratulate him Thursday. When he took the phone, Lynch said, Lago greeted him by saying, ""Yo."" Lago and White have had a pretty relaxed attitude toward meeting with political leaders. The invitation went out before Lago volunteered to leave Vancouver because Olympic officials weren't happy with photos of him that turned up on the Internet.\White told ESPN last week he'd like to be invited to the White House.\""We've seen some other Olympians do this, and I don't think we've had the honor, (but) to meet the President of the United States would be cool,"" he said.\Lynch headed off to Washington late last week to attend the winter meeting of the National Governor's Association. He and other governors will meet with the President tomorrow. Take that, snowboarders.\.\SEX OFFENDER DEBATE: The House passed a bill last week that bars any city or town from setting restrictions on where sex offenders can live. House Bill 1484 is a response to a court ruling that struck down restrictions in the city of Dover on sex offenders, including those who prey on children.\The debate in the House is not over, even though the bill is moving to the Senate.\Next month, Rep. Al Baldasaro will push for approval of his bill that sets restrictions throughout the sate, barring sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of any school or child care center. His bill, HB 1442, would not require any offender to move, and does not apply to minors.\.\LEGISLATING MEDICINE? Lyme disease sufferers who basked in victory after a surprising House vote last week face a fight in the Senate.\House members rejected an 18-1 committee recommendation and passed a bill that leaves doctors free to prescribe long-term antibiotic therapy for Lyme patients.\Committee members argued that misdiagnosed cases are the problem, not treatment.\State Public Health director Dr. Jose Montero said he will argue against the bill in the Senate.\The bill has two big problems, in his view. First, it authorizes a treatment that is not based on any scientific evidence. Secondly, it denies a patient the right to take action against a doctor who treats them improperly.\Montero acknowledges that Lyme is a terrible ailment, and that it can leave a patient with long-term neurological damage if not caught early.\""We don't as a state legislate a standard of medical practice. We do not tell doctors how to treat a patient,"" he said. ""And this removes patient protections from a physician who follows a treatment plan that is not science-based,"" he argued.\He said four national studies have shown long-term antibiotic therapy no more effective than placebos on Lyme patients.\The question in the Senate will be whether Montero's argument trump patients'Â'personal stories of suffering while searching for therapy that brings relief.\.\CALLING CONTROVERSY:\Bart Marcois, president of the Eagle Foundation in Washington, D.C., says his group was involved in calling Rep. Tony DiFruscia and other members of the House Judiciary Committee over gay marriage two weeks ago.\""Our driving concern is to get people involved in politics. We come in, do some research and try to get people get involved, but we've never represented ourselves as being anything but what we are,"" Marcois said.\DiFruscia filed a complaint with the Attorney General's Office over calls that were sent to his home phone. Some could be traced to an Eagle Foundation office in Manchester. Marcois said his first reaction to DiFruscia's complaint was ""what a whiner. It's incumbent upon an elected official to listen to constituents.""\.\Tom Fahey is State House bureau chief of the New Hampshire Union Leader and Sunday News.

131,"The time for Warren is now\I am a moderate Democrat, and I am voting for Elizabeth Warren in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary. It is beyond clear that our country cannot afford four more years with Donald Trump. The time is right for a leader with a bold vision for our future who is ready to stand up and fight for every single American. That leader is Elizabeth Warren.\We cannot stand by idly in the face of President Trump's sordid corruption, relentless attacks on women's reproductive rights, rollbacks on affordable health care and denial of climate change. We must come together behind a candidate who will not only beat Donald Trump but also bring an end to his misguided ideology of hate.\As a mother and grandmother, I fear for the future of our country. Three years of Donald Trump have undermined the safety and the economic competitiveness of the United States. President Trump brags of a booming stock market but President Warren will help build an economy where our nation's gains are felt at kitchen tables, not just in corporate boardrooms. Elizabeth Warren has the experience, vision and tenacity to realize a future where every family can succeed.\The time for a leader who will unite our country rather than tear it apart is now. The time for change is now. The time for President Warren is now.\ALICE CHAMBERLIN\Warner\Vote for the person who can woo Trump voters\New Hampshire Democrats, let's acknowledge an open secret. Your Republican friends are saying that while “she's a socialist and a gun-grabber,” they would reluctantly vote for Tulsi Gabbard. If you've been to any Tulsi event in the last year, you've seen one person after another get up and say, “I never thought I'd vote Democrat, but I'd vote for you.”\We have a first-in-the-nation duty to ensure that the standard-bearer we pick is the one who can beat Donald Trump in November. That doesn't happen by repeating “I can beat Trump” to the already converted. That happens by people who often vote Republican now voting Democrat.\We don't say it in polite company, but in 2016 some people who usually vote Democrat voted for Trump. Whatever other skullduggery happened, those people's votes are how Trump won.\Learn from history. Think strategically. Elect the person who will draw away the votes Trump got. Who knows, we might even get to end some wars in the bargain.\DENIS GODDARD\Hopkinton\Primary points\The approach of the Feb. 11 primary makes me want to say a few things out loud to fellow voters:\1) Primaries are about sending messages to the party leadership.\2) Remember that it's a primary for both parties. Republicans have a choice on the ballot, too. If you're a member of the GOP and unhappy with the current leadership of that party, make the effort to vote for Bill Weld. Voting for him will send a message.\3) If you're a Democrat, you should vote for the person you think represents your vision of our country's government. Don't worry about who can defeat the Republican in the general election. Your vote is your chance to say what and who you want. Don't try to be a strategist; remember, Donald Trump at one point wasn't electable, according to the press and pundits. Things can change before November. So use your chance right now to tell the leadership of the party whose ideas you like best.\4) If you are an undeclared or independent voter, you may vote in the primary. The New Hampshire Secretary of State's website says: “An undeclared voter may vote in a state primary or a presidential primary. You will be required to choose either a Republican or Democratic ballot when you go to vote.” You can return yourself to undeclared or independent of political party status as you exit the polling place by filling out a form before you leave.\5) Vote. Most of all, vote.\MARTHA KANE\Gilford\Why I choose Klobuchar\Like you I want a winner and realist who understands that most people want a fair shot at having a decent job, raising a family in a neighborhood with good schools, and taking care of each other and our environment.\I believe Amy Klobuchar is that person.\The Democrats need to choose a presidential candidate who can appeal to disaffected Republicans and independents who don't want to re-elect the current president but want an alternative with sound, cost-effective principles – not wholesale changes with unpredictable outcomes.\Amy has done this in Minnesota by winning all four elections she's entered and with ever-increasing bipartisan support.\Amy knows how Washington works, with two terms of experience in the Senate. She needs no learning curve on the ways of Washington and can take immediate action to improve the discourse and execute change the day after the inauguration.\She has a proven record of accomplishment with more than 100 bills passed, more than any other senator, by working with Republicans to serve the people of our country. Crossing the aisle to work with Republicans is critical to our country moving away from partisan gridlock and toward progress.\And Amy can be a president for eight years, not likely in the case with some of our other candidates.\If you want a sure bet instead of a pipedream, a leader with a record of successes, choose Amy on Feb. 11 and get us one step closer to positive change in the White House.\ZIB CORELL\Concord\Klobuchar can unite voters\This presidential primary, we have an impressive group of Democrats from whom to choose, with an abundance of noteworthy credentials, achievements and plans. It's hard to sort through the candidates and their visions for America.\After careful consideration, I have decided that the candidate with the best ability to unite our country and move us forward is Sen. Amy Klobuchar.\Amy is a dedicated, effective, proven leader. Remarkably, she has gotten at least 100 bipartisan bills passed in the U.S. Senate. Through straight talk, collaborativeness, practicality, level-headedness, consistency and grit, she knows how to get things done, whether that's by working to lower prescription drug prices, bridging the divide between rural, urban and suburban America, or fighting to rebuild our infrastructure.\To win the presidency, we need the candidate who can attract an array of voters. Amy has actually done it and by big margins. In her three Minnesota statewide elections, Amy has won everywhere, including historically Republican districts.\Amy knows how to win elections and win big. As a New Hampshire legislator, I know that to win big you need support from a wide variety of communities that share common values and goals. You need that broad, bipartisan support to make progress. Amy can unite voters to defeat President Trump.\As president, Amy will pave a positive future for our country. So on Feb. 11, I will vote for the candidate I know will advocate for all of America – Amy Klobuchar.\Rep. KAREN EBEL\New London\(The writer is deputy speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives.)\Why I choose Bennet\Many of us still have not decided for whom to vote. We weigh candidates' policies, experience or our own instincts when we meet candidates. Some try to apply strategy – who is most likely to win now, at the national conventions and in November.\One of the state's most influential leaders, the Democratic National Committeeman, has said that his heart speaks to one candidate, and his head another. He has listened to his head in making his decision. If there is any humor to be found, it is the same two candidates for each of us. For me, it is my heart that speaks to Vice President Joe Biden. With all his human faults and foibles, he has spent his life in public service. His experience is extensive as is his knowledge, and he has made great personal sacrifices.\But my head speaks to Sen. Michael Bennet, and it is he who I support. As head of the Denver school system, he worked to build a better a life for the children of his city who were being shortchanged by a system that did not put their needs first. Our democratic form of government cannot exist without an educated citizenry.\When Bennet joined the Senate from Colorado, he continued his focus on education, and added immigration reform, campaign finance reform and economic opportunity. He works across party lines and would bring to the White House knowledge, experience, civility and a commitment to the common good. I thank Biden for his service, but I will vote for Bennet.\Rep. MARJORIE SMITH\Durham\Residents pay enough for road maintenance\Well, here goes the Legislature again wanting to raise how much it will cost motorists who live in New Hampshire to register their vehicles so they can take that extra money for road maintenance. This is not right to just penalize New Hampshire residents when there are thousands of out-of-staters who use these roads as well. If they want extra money then there is the gas tax, which is what I thought was it used for. Don't go after a select group of people, whether an individual or a business that has motor vehicles registered in the state. Find another way to get the funds for this. We already pay enough for this.\MELODY TOWLE\Penacook\Let us call ourselves nurse anesthesiologists\Imagine spending six to eight years in college, thousands of hours of training in anesthesiology, graduating from a highly accredited nurse anesthesiology program with a master's/doctoral degree. What should the public and patient call you? Nurse anesthesiologist.\We are nurses who provide exceptional care in anesthesiology. Now, enter Sen. Tom Sherman, a physician on the Seacoast with Senate Bill 593 stating that we can no longer call ourselves nurse anesthesiologists.\The New Hampshire Board of Nursing, which regulates all nurses in New Hampshire, says we can, so why is this an issue? Why is a physician concerned with how we, as nurses, describe ourselves to patients?\Sherman wants to prevent nurse anesthesiologists from clearly explaining to New Hampshire patients who we are and what nurse anesthesiologists do. In what has become a bizarre name game debate in Concord, Sherman says nurses may not use the term anesthesiologist in their professional practice when talking to patients because he claims it is misleading and confusing.\I am nationally board certified and licensed by the New Hampshire Board of Nursing. I have been providing anesthesia care for eight years to patients.\Please tell lawmakers that SB 593 is wasting time and resources that should be spent on ways to lower health care costs and increase access to care for patients.

You know, the guy who averages a half-dozen provable lies a day, spent $100 million of taxpayer money on golf trips and called New Hampshire a “drug-infested den.” In New Hampshire we actually have a good choice running against the incumbent on the Republican side.\Bill Weld is a solid choice with a good record. His years as governor of Massachusetts showed he can work across the aisle. While governor he kept spending down and balanced the budget eight years in a row, something that Donald Trump has failed to do even once in the public sector, and apparently never did as a private citizen. Bill Weld doesn't stoop to being a divisive lightning rod. He's running on his good name and fine public record. The country needs more Republicans like Bill Weld.\JAMES K. COLE\Concord"
132,"
My wife and I, in the early stages of building a new home, have been thinking a lot about how to best stay warm and keep our energy costs down.
\
Solar power will play an important role in this, and while the idea of being ""off the grid"" does have a certain self-reliant appeal to it, I'm much more interested in being on the grid. Why? Because it makes more sense financially (for my family and the community as a whole) and for the environment.
\
However, the outdated policies in the state around ""net metering"" could change this calculus. Specifically, if the net metering caps in place (which are the lowest in New England, by far) prevent us from being compensated for selling our electricity back to the grid, the rational thing to do is to invest in a battery storage system, so that the energy that is generated can be used at some other time as opposed to just being wasted. That said, if we and other solar panel owners were to be off the grid, hoarding our electricity, the rest of the region would suffer by continuing to have to rely on the same old mix of fuels for energy production (and sometimes even resort to burning jet fuel).
\
By providing electricity, particularly during times of peak demand, solar can offset the need to fire up older, inefficient and costly power plants. Further, by increasing the supply and lowering the demand for electricity, on-grid homeowners with solar panels can help reduce the price of electricity for everybody else.
\
For the past hundred years or so, utility companies have been selling water in the desert, with residential customers in particular having little say over how their electricity is provided to them. But as with many other businesses, technology is causing massive disruptions in how consumers purchase and use their energy. And not surprisingly, many utility companies are pushing back.
\
One of the main arguments against net metering is that solar panel owners should pay their fair share for utilizing the power lines that transmit electricity back and forth. That is reasonable enough, but any such calculation should take into account the true cost of producing and transporting energy, including the negative externalities of burning fossil fuels (for example, the costs of cleaning up pollution, the decreased productivity that results from poor air quality and related illnesses, and the economic multiplier effect that we lose out on when our energy dollars are sent to out of state producers).
\
Additionally, solar can actually reduce the strain on our grids, as the electricity is usually consumed right where it's produced.
\
So as the Legislature looks at net metering in the next month or so, I hope lawmakers will consider the impact that this will have on those who have solar panels or are thinking about installing them, and what the unintended consequences of low caps can be.
\
Battery backup systems are quickly becoming economical, with prices dropping and performance improving, consumers are demanding more clean energy options, and the impacts from burning fossil fuels become more evident every day. In other words, it is starting to rain, and the residents and businesses of New Hampshire can view this as a threat or an opportunity relative to how our energy is produced, delivered and consumed.

A Democrat running for governor on Monday called to quickly raise and possibly eliminate the limit on how much renewable power consumers can sell back to the state's utilities.
\
Under ""net metering,"" consumers who use sources such as solar can earn credits for putting power back on the grid. In New Hampshire's 1998 law, the current limit is 50 megawatts and the state's utilities are closing in on that figure. For example, the state's largest utility, Eversource, has a cap of 36.6MW and was 8.7MW under it as of last Friday, including proposals that are in progress and those already online.
\
Colin Van Ostern, who announced his run for governor earlier this month, said Monday the state should lift the cap within the next 90 days and consider erasing it altogether.
\
""Solar energy projects in New Hampshire are critical for growing good jobs, boosting our clean tech economy, limiting future energy costs, and protecting our state's beautiful environment and unique quality of life,"" Van Ostern said in a statement.
\
On the state's Executive Council, Van Ostern supported solar energy projects that were approved in Durham, Manchester and Peterborough, and one that was defeated in Manchester.
\
Van Ostern said the state needs a solution by the end of January that lays the groundwork for a long-term policy for net metering and encourages the development of solar and other renewable energy.
\
Senate Majority Leader Jeb Bradley, a Wolfeboro Republican, said Monday that he'll submit legislation that will allow the state to raise the cap while the state's Public Utility Commission figures out new rules governing the cap.
\
One of the key elements, Bradley said, is for the PUC to determine a fair rate to reimburse people who put power back on the grid. Currently, they get the full retail rate, which can be two or three times higher than wholesale rates.
\
""You can't give an overly generous benefit,"" Bradley said. ""We're trying to protect everybody and encourage the solar industry.""
\
Acting quickly is important for the industry so it can lock in permits and contracts and start construction, said Andrew Kellar, founder of NHSolarGarden, a two-year-old company that has projects with a combined 22MW of solar power in the works.
\
""There's a need to know for the foreseeable future,"" Kellar said.
\
Martin Murray, a spokesman for Eversource, said the Massachusetts-based utility supports ""modest expansion"" of the cap while regulators tackle long-range questions of how to manage net metering so that the power grid is paid for fairly and appropriately.
\
Renewable energy advocates applaud the efforts to lift the cap, which they called arbitrary, too small and out of step with neighboring states. For example, Vermont two years ago increased its cap from 4 percent of the total load to 15 percent and is already considering raising it again.
\
""We've seen tremendous growth in this industry,"" said Kate Epsen, executive director of the New Hampshire Sustainable Energy Association. ""It's a good sign that the industry is mainstream now and represents a sector of the economy that needs to not be fettered.""

134,"For the Monitor\As a whole food supplement manufacturer based in Manchester, MegaFood holds human well-being at the core of what we do. We strive to ensure the well-being of our customers, our employees and our community, and we recognize that crucial pieces of that effort are a healthy environment and a strong economy. As a certified B Corp, we've made a promise to use business as a force for good. Always. As MegaFood's CEO, I couldn't be prouder of that promise. To that very accord, MegaFood has taken a stand and raised our voice in support of policies that will scale up clean energy – both here in Concord and in our nation's capital. It's got me pretty revved up.\While bipartisan policy solutions so often seem hard to come by, energy policy is one area where we see possible compromise across the aisle in Concord. This spring, New Hampshire lawmakers from both political parties worked together on a bill (Senate Bill 446) that would update New Hampshire's net metering law to encourage larger renewable energy projects.\SB 446 would raise the current cap on net metering projects from one megawatt to five megawatts, making it easier for businesses, municipalities and other large energy users to invest in larger, onsite renewable projects. This change would expand the amount of locally produced renewable energy in New Hampshire, which would in turn create more clean tech jobs, help stabilize energy prices, and reduce our need for imported fossil fuels and skyrocketing transmission costs. It seems hard to argue against.\Net metering allows electric utility customers who invest in renewable energy projects – such as rooftop solar or small-scale hydropower – to cut costs by selling the excess power they generate back to the grid. More than 40 states already have existing net metering policies in place, and they have proven to be an important tool to drive investment and economic growth.\In addition to the numerous economic benefits, increasing clean energy would also help reduce air pollution and improve public health, providing major benefits to Granite State communities – which is of vital importance to our company.\It is clear that SB 446 is a home run for New Hampshire, and it has drawn broad support from across the state. A large group of municipalities, businesses and health care institutions publicly endorsed the bill because they know, like we do, that raising the net metering cap and expanding our clean energy potential would greatly benefit the Granite State.\Last spring, MegaFood joined with other companies and institutions, including Dartmouth-Hitchcock, Timberland, Wire Belt Company of America and others, to send a letter to legislators in support of SB 446. In other words, I'm not the only business leader banging the drum on this issue.\Legislators are also in agreement on the bill, which passed both the House and Senate with unparalleled bipartisan support. Much of the Legislature's Republican leadership sponsored the bill, and it received no significant opposition when it came to a vote.\Unfortunately, Gov. Chris Sununu missed the opportunity to advance this beneficial legislation when he vetoed the bill in June, citing outdated and widely misleading claims about electric rates. This move was in direct opposition to the numerous businesses and institutions that told the governor such reform would help control energy costs and ensure that New Hampshire is a competitive place to do business. In vetoing the bill, it appears that Gov. Sununu is more interested in the views of utilities and out-of-state, anti-clean-energy special interests than in local businesses here in the Granite State.\We join many of our peers in expressing our profound disappointment in Gov. Sununu's veto. New Hampshire already lags behind our neighboring states in advancing a clean energy economy, and now we risk falling further behind.\The good news is that legislators will have an opportunity to override the governor's veto when they reconvene this month. Legislators from both sides of the aisle should heed the call of businesses and recognize the value of a larger net metering cap and the benefits it will bring to our economy, environment, and communities. We must keep New Hampshire moving forward so that it remains a good place to live, work and do business. Who's with me?\(Robert Craven is the CEO of MegaFood, a whole food supplement company headquartered in Manchester.)\"

As New Hampshire's largest local solar installer, we are proud to have seen our business grow by leaps and bounds as the cost of our product (solar panels) declined by over 75 percent in the last 10 years, a perfect antidote to two of our state's most pressing problems: high energy costs and an environmental crisis caused by reliance on fossil fuels.
\
We hired 16 new full-time employees in 2015 (45 total) and will continue hiring this year if the Legislature raises the arbitrary cap on retail net metering and allows us to meet market demand for our product.
\
In its October 2015 report, the Acadia Center found that solar energy backfed to New Hampshire's utility grid is worth between 19 to 24 cents per kWh, plus an additional 6.7 cents per kWh of societal benefits. This finding corresponds to similar studies in Maine, Vermont and Massachusetts, acknowledging solar's ""unique value to the electric grid by reducing energy demand, providing power during peak periods and avoiding generation and related emissions charges from conventional power plants.""
\
Retail net metering is not a subsidy. It is, if anything, below-market compensation for solar generators. We trust that the state's legislators, when they thoughtfully consider the issue, will come to the same conclusion as our neighbors, Vermont and Massachusetts, who increased their retail net metering caps.
\
Solar is good for business, good for ratepayers and good for New Hampshire's environment. Utility companies should modernize, and take advantage of distributed grid technologies, not fight them to sustain a 20th-century business model.

136,"Override veto of net metering bill\I have met Gov. Chris Sununu, and he is certainly affable. But he is not listening to his constituents.\The citizens of New Hampshire elected a Democratic House and Senate in November, moving forward with bills to eliminate the death penalty and raise the net metering cap. Our governor vetoed both.\The first veto was overridden. The second should be, too.\With growing concern about climate change throughout this country, businesses that utilize clean energy are more likely to be viewed as favorable work environments for young workers. New Hampshire may actually be losing environmentally aware businesses and their employees because of its backward fossil-fuel promoting energy policies.\Please encourage your state representatives and senators to override Sununu's veto on House Bill 365, thereby boosting municipal and commercial solar projects.\SUSAN SHAMEL\Hillsborough\Understanding the price of freedom\Exceptional accounts in last week's Monitor of the memories of four D-Day veterans.

138,"Legislature should override net metering veto\I hear that a veto override vote on House Bill 365 could be soon. It is absolutely certain that distributed renewable energy resources are the future of energy supply.\At one time, distributed “microgrids” were the norm, in the 1880s when electricity distribution was new and entrepreneurs and researchers set up small generating plants and ran wires a few blocks down Main Street to hook up interested businesses and residents. We moved on to today's central generation and distribution grid, but that is in no way the end of development in the electrical supply business. The state of New Hampshire must be a willing partner in the transformation of the grid to supply the world the next generations will inhabit.\If the governor's concern is really a few cents difference in a power bill, he could be working to expand group net metering, to offer advantage to those who are not positioned to own solar arrays. In any case, the fiscal impact on the grid is much more complicated than just monthly customer billing. The PUC knows this, as do other experts in the field.\The governor will be working hard to sway votes to maintain the status quo, to the advantage, no doubt, of interests known to him. I hope the Legislature will resist the governor's calls and override the veto. We should not encourage the governor's attempt to lead New Hampshire headlong into the 20th century.\FRED PORTNOY\Canterbury\Thank you, Ward 4 voters\I am writing to thank everyone who came out and voted in the Ward 4 special election.

Thank you for the opportunity to serve you.\MEREDITH HATFIELD\Concord\Protect the ACA\Preserving and improving access to health care is a fundamental responsibility of our state government. A current federal lawsuit filed by the state of Texas and supported by the Trump administration would repeal the entire Affordable Care Act.\For low-income people, such a repeal would cause approximately 50,000 New Hampshire citizens to lose their Medicaid expansion health insurance, and 44,000 people to lose their partially subsidized health insurance on the New Hampshire exchange.\For all Granite Staters, popular consumer protections, including coverage for pre-existing conditions and essential benefits, would disappear. For many people preventive health services, such as senior wellness visits, vaccinations, contraception care and cancer screening would become prohibitively expensive.\I respectfully encourage Gov. Chris Sununu to sign Senate Bill 4, which incorporates into state law coverage for essential health benefits and pre-existing conditions to protect our citizens in case the Affordable Care Act is repealed. In addition, I ask the governor to speak out publicly against the current administration's efforts to repeal the entire Affordable Care Act.\RANDY HAYES\Canterbury\Families should have a choice for services\Recently, Gov. Chris Sununu asked our congressional delegation to support New Hampshire's request for granting individual waivers to a federal rule that eliminates the option for individuals with intellectual disabilities or acquired brain disorders to receive all of their services from a single provider agency.\As parents and family members, we do not understand why the federal government is disallowing our right to choose. CMS has ignored our request for any study data that would demonstrate a problem of quality or cost inefficiency with the single provider system that has supported our children for decades.\Since the 1980s, family participation in New Hampshire's community-based regional system has resulted in an innovative service system, with checks and balances to protect and preserve individual choice. Sadly, the CMS rule is disrupting and preoccupying New Hampshire's service system, whose focus and efforts should be directed toward addressing the more critical and urgent issue of recruitment and retention of staff and providers.\Gov. Sununu captured it well in his letter to our congressional delegation: “N.H.'s regulations have long enabled individuals in need of services to make decisions regarding their services and to choose their providers based on their individual needs, situation and preferences. In doing so, many have chosen to receive all of their services from the same agency. This approach has worked and enabled them to address issues efficiently.”\We appeal to our elected officials: Please do not let New Hampshire's longstanding tradition of providing individual and family choice become lost. These are our family members' lives.\GARY LEMAY\Meredith\Why don't we want  young people to vote?\Last year's House Bill 1264 was passed for the sole purpose of changing the requirements for proving residency. It made it harder for students and temporary workers to register and vote. The effect will be a suppression of voter turnout for the 2020 primaries and elections.\I wonder why we would want to do this since we are so actively involved in the process? Wouldn't we want every legal resident to vote?\In researching the issue, I came across a Nov 2018 article in slate.com titled, “Why Don't Young People Vote?” by Jamelle Bouie. The article cites data showing the average turnout of 18-24 year olds was 40% for presidential elections and closer to 20% in the midterms. Older Americans averaged 67% in the presidential and 59% in the midterms.\So, what's the issue? We are an aging population. That means the older residents can easily outvote the younger, much smaller population. Why make it harder for young people to vote? Is it that we want to discourage them from locating here? Is it that we don't like young people? Is it that we don't like the way they vote?\Let's encourage Gov. Sununu to sign HB 106 to go back to a simpler definition of someone who lives here and intends to stay “for the indefinite future.” New Hampshire should never be in the business of restricting legal residents from voting. It looks bad and it's bad law.\FRANCES TAYLOR\Holderness\Girl Scouts find success with outreach program\Girl Scouts of the Green and White Mountains is committed to giving girls across New Hampshire and Vermont the opportunity to become women of courage, confidence and character, who make the world a better place.

CH+R has already made it possible for 23 girls to begin their Girl Scout experience, with a commitment to make camp and outdoor programs financially accessible for girls this summer, too.\Girls in outreach troops come from different cultures and socioeconomic groups. They may never have heard of Girl Scouts before their introduction through the outreach troops, but they quickly pick up on the Girl Scout way, excited and happy to help their sister Girl Scouts take on service projects, go camping, earn badges and more.\We will continue our mission to provide the world's best leadership program for girls, with help from partners like Concord Housing and Redevelopment, who make this program possible.\PATRICIA K.

139,"For the Monitor\I recently stood next to Gov. Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire's largest solar-powered brewery as she ceremoniously signed legislation to expand clean energy across the state.\The bill we were celebrating was officially made law by Gov. Hassan in May. It doubled New Hampshire's arbitrary cap on homes and businesses that use net metering – a policy that enables energy users to generate their own power and receive fair credit for any excess they send back to the grid.\Without forward-thinking energy policies like net metering we would not have been hosting the bill signing at the Throwback Brewery in North Hampton. These policies enabled my company to install a large solar array across the brew pub's roof, allowing for lower energy bills, increased energy independence and an overall more environmentally friendly experience. Homeowners and businesses across the state deserve the opportunity to produce and use clean energy, and local workers should have a chance to prosper with good-paying, high-quality jobs.\We are proud to stand with leaders like Gov. Hassan who are promoting the development of sustainable energy choices. But doubling the net metering cap was just the start. The bill also initiated a 10-month study by the state's Public Utility Commission to explore the future of clean energy policy in New Hampshire.\It's critical that customer-focused policy solutions like net metering are upheld by the commission. These policies have the power to unlock a booming new economy. Solar and other clean energy resources represent good jobs for local workers – jobs that cannot be outsourced. Look no further than our southern neighbor, Massachusetts, where stable energy policy has led to 15,000 solar jobs throughout the state. Meanwhile, New Hampshire has more than 1,000.\In fact, just look at my company. ReVision Energy is a microcosm of this job growth opportunity. We went from just two guys in a garage to roughly 140 employees across Northern New England. We want to invest in New Hampshire. But in order to maximize the creation of solar jobs and to bring solar savings to more individuals and businesses, we need certainty on policy so that we can invest with confidence.\Moving forward with smart clean-energy policy is of dire importance for the future of our planet. Today New Hampshire has the second highest per capita fossil fuel consumption and carbon pollution in all of New England. The state has the opportunity to show leadership and work to transition off of dirty fossil fuels for the benefit of the environment and economy alike.\People want solar energy. Recent statewide polling shows that New Hampshire voters – both Republicans and Democrats – favor solar as an energy source, and a clear majority support net metering. Moreover, nearly all of the most recent independent studies on net metering show rooftop solar provides a financial benefit to all energy consumers, including those without solar. Everybody wins.\New Hampshire policy makers must be thoughtful as they consider what's next for the state. I am hopeful they will recognize policies like net metering as fundamental for creating jobs, bringing solar to people of all incomes and furthering the state's clean energy leadership. I urge New Hampshire to provide this certainty to companies like mine. Let's keep moving New Hampshire forward and make it a national leader that other states will envy.\(Phil Coupe is co-founder of New Hampshire-based ReVision Energy.)"
140,"For the Monitor\As a lifelong Republican and former chairman of the New Hampshire Senate Environmental Committee, I recognize the immediate need for strong policies to protect our natural resources and combat climate change. A cleaner and stronger environment is not only essential for future generations, but it also is key to helping Granite Staters and businesses across our state thrive now. This is not simply a Democratic or Republican issue, and I am proud to stand with leaders from either party who are fully committed to protecting our environment.\That's why in the race to represent New Hampshire in the U.S. Senate, I am eager to support Gov. Maggie Hassan.\Maggie understands the effects of climate change on our economy and our way of life, and throughout her career in public service, she has fought to take action on clean energy priorities.\As state senator, Maggie sponsored the original legislation for our state to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to reduce harmful emissions and energy costs and create jobs here in New Hampshire. And she helped pass the New Hampshire Renewable Portfolio Standard to maintain and grow the renewable energy sector.\As governor, she has built on those efforts, signing bipartisan legislation to update the RPS, investing in energy efficiency, and raising the net metering cap to help the clean energy industry in New Hampshire grow and thrive.\She has also called on members of New Hampshire's congressional delegation to support the Clean Power Plan, she entered New Hampshire in a global contract (Under 2 MOU) with cities, states and provinces to limit the increase in global average temperature, and has worked with our nation's governors to further state collaboration in energy planning and policymaking.\Maggie has made clear that in the Senate, protecting the environment will be a top priority. And in her economic plan, Maggie laid out the priorities she will focus on to build a cleaner, more affordable energy future for our state and our nation.\New Hampshire needs a senator who will always fight for our environment and put our natural resources first.\Maggie understands that protecting our environment is more than just an election year issue. Her support for the environment isn't a political calculation, it's at the core of what she's fought for throughout her time in public service – and it always will be.\This election is a critical test of our nation's priorities, and regardless of political party, we need to think about what kind of future we are leaving for our children. Despite being a registered Republican, I will cast my vote in November not based on party, but rather based on who is the strongest leader on issues that are critical to the future of our nation and our planet.\When it comes to protecting our environment, Maggie Hassan is the clear choice for New Hampshire.\(Rick Russman lives in Kingston.)"
141,"Monitor staff\Seven months after he vetoed a Democratic effort to expand “net metering” in New Hampshire, Gov. Chris Sununu has proposed a scaled-back approach to green energy growth.\The governor announced his support for a group of legislation that would provide modest increases to the state's cap on net metering for residents and businesses that generate renewable power.\But one of the bills endorsed would slash the rates at which participants of larger-scale projects would be repaid – by more than half.\That and other limitations drew quick criticism from environmental activists Monday, who distanced themselves from the bills.\“We hear all the time that government shouldn't be picking winners and losers,” said Madeleine Mineau, executive director of Clean Energy N.H. “So we would prefer expanded net metering to be fair and equal across customers of every size. ”\Announced as a responsible approach to building up net metering, the package includes a trio of bills co-authored by the Republican governor's office that would allow those generating power to increase the amount of energy they get compensated for and would let cities and towns take part.\“These clean energy bills are a homerun for ratepayers and the environment,” said Sununu, saying the bills were “ushering in a new clean energy era in New Hampshire.”\The governor's preferred changes would raise the limit of renewable energy that owners of solar panels and other energy sources can use to offset their electric bills.\Presently, “customer-generators” may use the electricity generated at their homes or businesses to offset up to one megawatt of energy from their energy bill using default energy rates; Sununu's bill would expand that to generators above 1 megawatt per hour, but cap sales at 125% of the average usage rate.\But the bills also include significant limitations.\One of the bills, House Bill 1481, would more than halve the per-Kilowatt-hour rate at which larger customer-generators could be credited by utility companies, reducing the financial benefit for those participating.\Under that proposed legislation, instead of the current 8- or 9-cent payout per-Kilowatt-hour for generators smaller than one megawatt, generators over one megawatt would receive a payout around four cents. That would limit the benefits of expanded net metering to larger generators with economies of scale.\Democrats called the bills half-measures and called on Sununu to support their more ambitious plans.\“It's disappointing that after vetoing bipartisan legislation, Governor Sununu chose to focus on partisan measures rather than reaching across the aisle to find real solutions,” said Sen. Dan Feltes, a Democrat from Concord who is running for governor.\Democrats and some Republicans have been pressing for years to increase the net-metering cap to five megawatts, arguing that doing so would encourage greater use of solar and hydropower and keep costs down for businesses and cities looking to use it.\But Sununu has frequently opposed those efforts, maintaining that such an increase would amount to a subsidy for solar panels companies from utilities, and contending that it could lead to costs being pushed onto ratepayers.\Instead, Sununu said his scaled-down proposals would allow for net metering expansion within more responsible limits.\“These bills protect ratepayers and remove government barriers instead of enacting new ones – something past clean energy-related legislation has not been able to accomplish.,” the governor said.\Sununu's preferred bill, House Bill 1481, would let those who produce more than 1 megawatt of renewable energy to sell back up to 125% of the energy they used to the utility companies.\That's less than the bill Sununu vetoed, which allowed businesses to use generators up to five megawatts in size for net metering – with any energy not used by the consumer eligible to be sold back to the grid.\But to some advocates of clean energy, the issue with the bill is not the cap but the payout.\Under current law, those benefiting from net metering receive the “default service rate” – an amount varying and set by the Public Utilities Commission at auction. That rate is presently 8 to 9 cents.\The new system would apply the “avoided cost credit” for generators over 1 megawatt. That credit fluctuates between 3.9 and 4.3 cents.\It's a payout reduction of more than half. And it would mean that those trying to take advantage of the increase would need to generate at least 2.5 megawatts to make as much as those under the current cap before it became profitable.\To advocates of the bill, that low payout is by design. The governor's office has long warned about the possibility of utility companies cost-shifting onto ratepayers if net metering is expanded too quickly, something that the bills' supporters said could be contained by lower payout rates.\Keeping the rates low for larger producers would help mitigate that cost-shifting risk, the bill's supporters added – and the rates could be raised later by the PUC.\To Mineau those low rates are a dealbreaker and would disincentivize medium-size clean energy generators.\The trio of bills also included House Bill 1402. That bill would allow municipalities to participate in larger-scale net metering – long a goal for some cities – by carving out an exception for them in statute.\The change would allow cities to apply to the Public Utilities Commission, provided they demonstrated that they were providing net metering to people within their districts.\The bills added a complicating wrinkle to the efforts made by Democrats, who favor lifting the cap on net metering for all parties. Two similar bills – SB 13 and SB 159 – are set to come up for a floor vote in the Senate on Wednesday.\“While we welcome movement from the governor on net metering, the most important thing to do is to raise the cap on net metering as proposed in HB 365 and SB 13, a concept that was endorsed by municipalities across the state and had bipartisan support in the Legislature,” Sen. David Watters, a Dover Democrat, said in a statement.\The Republican-backed bills could peel off some of the bipartisan support last year for more substantial increases to the net metering program. For her part, Mineau stayed optimistic.\“We're hoping that this press release is indicating the governor's interest in finding a solution … and that we can work in this starting place with these bills and find a compromise that would genuinely work for everyone,” Mineau said.\Still, to co-sponsors of the bills, they strike the right balance between clean energy expansion and maintaining existing infrastructure.\Rep. Tim Lang, a Sanbornton Republican, called the bills “a huge opportunity for New Hampshire.”\“With Governor Sununu's leadership we have found creative ways to break the net metering deadlock and unleash more private investment in the state, all without adversely impacting ratepayers,” he said.\\(Ethan DeWitt can be reached at edewitt@cmonitor.com, at (603) 369-3307, or on Twitter at @edewittNH.)"
142,"Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan is seeking to unseat Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte in the state's U.S. Senate contest. Polls show the race in a dead-heat and the contest has received substantial national attention because it could decide party control of the Senate. Hassan, a two-term governor, is casting herself as a bipartisan problem solver who is not afraid to break with her party on issues of national security.\\Hassan, 58, had previously spent six years in the state Senate representing a district near the Seacoast and during the last two she was the Democratic majority leader. Hassan lives in Newfields with her husband, Tom, the former head of Phillips Exeter Academy.\As governor, she signed bills to expand Medicaid and increase funding for addiction treatment. Hassan vetoed proposals to do away with a conceal carry gun license. While she came into the corner office in 2012 with plans to raise the state's minimum wage and expand gambling to generate new state revenue, neither proposal got through the state Legislature.\Hassan is a strong supporter of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, though she faced criticism this summer over an awkward exchange on CNN when she dodged a reporter's question three times on whether Clinton is trustworthy. Hassan later clarified she finds the former secretary of state trustworthy and honest.\Economy \Hassan supports raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour, up from the current rate of $7.25 on which New Hampshire relies. She has proposed a plan to implement a new $1,000 tax credit for middle class families earning less than $200,000 a year, and she plans to pay for it by eliminating tax subsidies for major oil companies and businesses that move jobs abroad.\She supports passing the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill senate Democrats have proposed in Washington as a way to close the gender pay gap. It has failed in the Republican-led chamber.\Foreign policy \Hassan aligns with Washington Democrats on some foreign policy initiatives, but breaks with her party on others. She advocates the U.S. enforce an “imperfect” nuclear agreement with Iran, and says the deal is the best way to prevent the country from obtaining dangerous weapons.\She opposes President Obama's plan to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay and is against the administration's Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. On the Syria conflict, Hassan has voiced support for additional airstrikes and expanding the use of targeted special forces to combat ISIS.\Hassan was the only Democratic governor out of more than two dozen who called for the U.S. to stop accepting Syrian refugees in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks last year. She stands by her call for a temporary pause, and hasn't specified whether she supports Clinton's proposal to bring in 65,000 refugees from Syria.\Education\Hassan supports expanding the federal Pell grant program, which are need-based and unlike student loans, don't have to be repaid. The current maximum grant is $5,815 for the 2016-17 school year.\Hassan also supports efforts to allow students to refinance their college loans at current interest rates and would back cutting interest rates for new student loans.\Gun policy\Hassan supports Senate Democrats' proposals to expand background checks for purchases online and at gun shows, measures that have stalled in the Republican-led Senate. Currently, only licensed firearm dealers have to run checks on prospective buyers.\Hassan has also called for an “appropriate, fair assault weapons ban.” She supports restricting gun sales to people on the federal government's terrorist watch list.\Social Security\Hassan pledges to fight efforts to privatize or cut Social Security, which is expected to become insolvent within 20 years. Hassan is open to adjusting the payroll tax cap so wealthier citizens pay more into the system. She hasn't been specific about how much the threshold should be raised.\Transportation\Hassan opposes a raise in the federal gas tax, which was last hiked in 1994 to the current rate of 18.4 cents. Hassan signed legislation as governor increasing the state gas tax by four cents.\Hassan supports the creation of a national infrastructure bank, an independent government corporation that would support and help finance road and bridge projects, among others.\Health care \Hassan says the federal government should “build on the progress” of the Affordable Care Act because it has allowed people to get insurance coverage who have pre-existing conditions. She supports repealing the medical device tax.\She supports federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a health care and abortion provider that runs five clinics in New Hampshire.\Environment\On environmental issues, Hassan has advocated ending federal tax subsidies for major oil companies, investing in “green-energy technology” and creating a national model rule for net metering, which lets homeowners sell electric companies their excess solar power.\She doesn't plan to initiate or support a carbon tax “right now,” she has said. Hassan has voiced support for setting a national target of 50 percent clean and carbon-free electricity by 2030.\On Northern Pass, a controversial transmission line set to run through New Hampshire, Hassan said she supports additional burial. But she thinks blasting required for underground burial in some areas could be more environmentally damaging than putting the line overhead.\– Allie Morris"
143,"For the Monitor\Albert Einstein said, “The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything.”\This statement inspired us to get involved in addressing climate change in our community of Sanbornton. According to scientists, climate change is accelerating as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have reached their highest point in over 3 million years.\There are many signs of climate change here in New Hampshire: extreme weather events, changes in wildlife behavior, droughts and changes in maple syrup production to name just a few. These changes pose a serious threat not only to our environment but also to our state's economy.\I offer one New Hampshire community's effort to address climate change, and volatile energy costs:\Despite having little experience in energy efficiency or renewable energy, we decided to get involved by establishing the Energy Committee of Sanbornton. The largest opportunity to cut carbon emissions in our community was in our largest energy consumer: the Winnisquam Regional School District. When we first approached them with our ideas, we were told by the school board, “If it costs a penny, the answer is no.”\As you can imagine, that created quite a challenge. But, through rebates, grants and a performance contract with Honeywell, we were able to cobble together a financing package for a $3.6 million project without putting any additional burden on our local property tax payers.\Energy efficiency and renewable energy led the way.\We installed 2,635 high-efficiency lighting units and 76 occupancy sensors.\Upgraded the building envelope and energy efficiency at all six schools.\Replaced a roof on one school building.\Installed heating system and control upgrades, including energy-efficient pumps with variable frequency drives.\Constructed a $2.3 million, wood-chip burning biomass plant at our high school/middle school campus with a classroom designed to teach green technologies.\Our accomplishments are performing better than expected. This first phase has been cash-flow positive from day one, and has saved more than $1.3 million in avoided energy costs to date, and is projected to save more than $5 million over the next 20 years.\By switching to sustainably harvested woodchips, this project displaces roughly 100,000 gallons of fuel oil, eliminating more than 935 tons of carbon emissions per year.\Since the original energy saving changes, Sanbornton has also added:\A new Department of Public Works garage that uses approximately one-third the energy per square foot compared to the original building.\High-efficiency lighting in all of our municipal buildings.\A wood-pellet biomass plant at Sanbornton's elementary school.\And 432 photovoltaic (solar) panels at Southwick Elementary School, through a power-purchase agreement. The clean-energy solar project is estimated to save $1.4 million over its lifetime and prevents 144,000 pounds of carbon from entering our atmosphere each year.\So, as you can see, there is much that can be done at the local level, and we must continue to do more.\Energy conservation policies, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, Systems Benefit Charge, Renewable Energy Certificates and net metering provide funding for investment in critical efficiency upgrades and renewable energy sources for our homes, businesses and community infrastructure, lowering our energy costs and protecting our environment. This is win-win.\In a 1983 interview, the photographer Ansel Adams said: “It is horrifying that we have to fight our own government to save our environment.” But that is exactly where we are today.\Many of our leaders have not only failed but would have us go backward through funding cuts, deregulation and dismantling of the EPA, which will only make matters worse. When leaders fail to listen to the will of the people, we must take advantage of opportunities at the local, grassroots level to initiate and support energy projects that will lower our carbon emissions.\With climate change, we do not have the luxury of time.\Local action is even more important since the Trump administration is defunding programs aimed at mitigating climate change. In our state, Gov. Chris Sununu has been skeptical about the economic benefits of energy efficiency and renewable energy but recently approved the extension of the energy-saving Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.\There is no sitting this one out. I invite Gov. Sununu and other school districts to come tour our schools and learn how we were able to take cost effective, positive steps to lower our carbon footprint.\So much more needs to be done.\Climate change will continue to bring more frequent and more costly catastrophic weather events. We have no time to waste. Let's get busy.\(Ian Raymond is a former state representative for Belknap County District 4, Tilton/Sanbornton, where he served on the Science, Technology, and Energy Committee.

Solar power, which has been growing by leaps and bounds both in the United States and abroad, is all but stalled in New Hampshire. The Granite State became a national leader when it joined in the regional effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in 2008 but has fallen far behind when it comes to green energy.
\
A 2014 study found that the state had just 5 megawatts of installed solar power, the lowest number of any of the 32 states surveyed. The state, which has some of the weakest incentives of any that promote the use of alternative energy, will fall even further behind unless lawmakers act soon to increase net metering, the requirement that utilities buy surplus solar power at a price that promotes its expansion.
\
The total cap on net metering was set at 50 megawatts, or the amount used by 150 or so homes. That cap has largely been reached. Without net metering, sweetened by the current requirement that utilities pay a premium price when buying surplus power, the payback time on a solar system increases dramatically. Sales decrease and companies like Solar City, which recently brought its innovative solar power model to New Hampshire, are forced to lay off employees.
\
Solar City and some of its competitors lease space on residential or commercial rooftops, install panels at their cost, and in exchange receive the tax breaks and much of the savings between the cost of the power produced and the utility rate. The property owner sees a much lower electricity bill and the chance to own the panels outright after a period of years and then enjoy all the savings.
\
The slow spread of alternative energy is bad for New Hampshire's economy, environment and image. The young, techno-savvy workers the state wants to attract and keep see themselves as part of the post-carbon generation. For them, relying on fossil fuels will soon be the equivalent of pounding bones on a rock for dinner. Lawmakers have before them a bill that would increase the cap on net metering by a paltry 25 megawatts, which is not enough to provide the certainty business needs to invest and expand.
\
To promote the expansion of solar power, the price utilities must pay to purchase surplus power was set at 16.5 cents per kilowatt. The price includes an estimate of the savings utilities enjoy from not having to build new power plants and substations to meet peak seasonal demand. But that price is far higher than what a utility would pay for peak power from other generators on the New England network. So the subsidy, utilities argue, unfairly transfers costs to customers who don't or can't take advantage of solar power.
\
The true extent of the subsidy, however, is hard to determine. The equation is complicated because the fossil fuel industry also enjoys subsidies, albeit mostly hidden ones. They come chiefly in the form of emissions that contribute to global warning and cause myriad health problems. If a tax on carbon were enacted to reflect those costs, alternative energy would need no subsidy to compete with utilities on the open market. In many places, even without a subsidy, green power is already competitive.
\
The state's Business and Industry Association supports raising the cap if, that is, the net metering rate is set at the much lower wholesale rate. That rate averaged 6.32 cents in 2014, peaked during the gas shortage that year at 16.7 cents, and fell to a 12-year low this year at 1.96 cents. At 16.5 cents, the net metering tariff is too high. At market rates, for now, it's way too low. Lawmakers should halve the net metering rate, triple or quadruple the cap and see what happens.

The Concord City Council will decide today whether to build a solar field at the Hall Street wastewater treatment plant.
\
If approved, SolarCity Corp. would construct one or two 1.98 million kilowatt-hour solar arrays on city property. Concord would not own the arrays, but it would buy electricity generated there. The agreed-upon price is slightly higher than what the city currently pays for electricity, but it would be fixed for 20 years. SolarCity would also pay property taxes on the panels - in the first year, about $400,000.
\
""What this does is lock those prices in for 20 years,"" City Manager Tom Aspell said. ""The real benefit is that there would be tax revenue, and it's good from an environmental standpoint.""
\
The arrays, however, would encroach on city land leased to a local farmer - Keith Richard, owner of Green Gold Farm of Pembroke.
\
The farm uses that land for haying and planting, according to a report from Brian LeBrun, deputy city manager for finance. The arrays would take up about 15 of the 39 available acres at that property, and about 28 percent of the land used by Green Gold Farm. It is unclear whether Richard would want to continue using that land if he lost that acreage to the solar field; voice mails at the farm's phone number were not returned.
\
LeBrun said Green Gold Farm paid about $1,800 last year for its lease and taxes. Pending a vote on the solar arrays, the city has not yet signed a new lease with Richard.
\
Green Gold Farm has been leasing that land for at least 20 years, LeBrun said.
\
""There are obviously some folks that want to make sure we maintain farming land as farming land,"" LeBrun said. ""There may be some opportunity to minimize the impact and keep as much of the property farmable as possible.""
\
Ultimately, the council will need to weigh the solar project against the farm.
\
""It really boils down to a policy decision,"" LeBrun said.
\
The project has been in the works for more than a year. LeBrun called it the ""brainchild"" of Ward 5 Councilor Rob Werner, who serves as chairman of the city's energy and environment advisory committee.
\
""As a capital city, we want to remain in a leadership position in the state of New Hampshire around energy issues, and leading the way toward more renewable resources,"" Werner said. ""There's lots of communities around the state that have been moving along the path of solar.""
\
In December 2014, the council approved about $34,000 to hire a consultant to study the idea. In September 2015, the city put out a request for proposals for solar arrays at four possible sites: the capped landfill on Old Turnpike Road, the Hutchins Street water treatment facility, and the wastewater treatment facilities on Hall Street and Penacook Road.
\
Concord received six bids, as well as a seventh proposal from Ranger Solar for the city to purchase all of its electricity from a large array owned by a third party. City officials said only the proposal from SolarCity made financial sense.
\
""It's something that is the right thing to do, the good thing to do for the environment,"" Werner said. ""It's a benefit to Concord taxpayers in terms of energy mix.""
\
Concord's electric bill is currently about $1.7 million each year. The Hall Street plant and street lights are among the biggest users, LeBrun said. The electricity generated by the solar panels could account for about $267,000 - about 15 percent - of that spending.
\
Concord will still pay roughly the same amount for its electricity, LeBrun said. But a 20-year contract with SolarCity is more stable than the current pricing, which is contracted for only one or two years at a time.
\
According to a report from consultant Beacon Integrated Solutions, the savings are estimated at $983,000 for one array, or $1.97 million for both, over 20 years.
\
""We look at it as a hedge against future increases in electricity costs,"" LeBrun said. ""We think the downside on the financial side is relatively small.""
\
The project is possible under the state's net metering law, which limits how many customers can sell excess solar power back into the grid. Because of the number of solar projects in recent years, the Legislature is considering raising that cap. A bill passed the House last week, and it is now headed to the Senate. For Concord's arrays to materialize, that measure would likely need to succeed.
\
""If it passes, then we should be underneath the cap without any problem,"" LeBrun said. ""But that was still an open question.""
\
Meanwhile, Werner said the council shouldn't be deterred from moving forward.
\
""That shouldn't stop us,"" he said.
\
The meeting will begin at 7 p.m. in council chambers.

146,"For the Monitor\For nearly a decade, the debate over energy in New Hampshire has centered on Northern Pass. Whether you support or oppose the 1,100 MW, 192-mile transmission project to bring hydro power from Quebec, the unanimous ruling by the state Site Evaluation Committee brings the contentious issue to a close. Barring a reversal at the SEC or an abrupt injunction by the New Hampshire Supreme Court, Northern Pass is dead.\As Granite Staters battled over one divisive energy project from abroad, our neighbors to the south and west let some 350,000 local solar projects bloom. The effects in terms of energy produced and jobs created in Massachusetts and Vermont stand in stark contrast to New Hampshire's present path. More importantly, they light the way to a brighter energy future for the Granite State, marked by lower costs and homegrown energy independence.\Consider the economic and environmental gains made by neighboring states – both with equivalent landmass and solar potential to New Hampshire – while policymakers in Concord were locked in a costly debate over Northern Pass.\In Massachusetts, policies designed to encourage homegrown clean power generation and reduce electricity costs have resulted in 1,898 MW of solar on rooftops and once-unproductive land as of 2017 – 73 percent more installed capacity than Northern Pass. Thanks to a forward-thinking and consistent Renewable Portfolio Standard, maintained by both Democratic and Republican administrations, Massachusetts now ranks sixth in the nation in terms of installed solar capacity, close behind presumptive solar behemoths like Arizona and Nevada, and well ahead of the “Sunshine State” of Florida.\Even more remarkable, Massachusetts ranks second after California in terms of solar jobs, with over 500 solar companies employing some 14,582 Bay State workers from sales and marketing to electricians and engineers. Already 311,922 Bay State homes are powered with solar – 30 times the New Hampshire count – and the number is set to double in the next five years as the state adds an additional 1,834 MW of installed capacity. Thanks in part to solar, residential electricity rates are lower in Massachusetts than New Hampshire while commercial rates are on par.\Meanwhile, our neighbor to the west recently joined California, Nevada and Hawaii as one of only four states with over 10 percent of total electricity generated by solar (Massachusetts is at 7.42 percent and New Hampshire at 0.46 percent solar). Although Vermont's population and GDP are less than half the size of New Hampshire's, the Green Mountain State has seen a clean energy industry boom with over $472 million in total solar investments in recent years.\Those investments have produced 1,767 local private-sector jobs and 204 MW of installed solar capacity – 22 times higher, as a percentage of electricity generation, than New Hampshire. Not surprisingly, Vermont families and businesses enjoy lower rates of electricity than their counterparts in New Hampshire.\Although Vermont and Massachusetts are different in many ways, both states have achieved rapid private-sector job growth and clean energy capacity thanks to consistent, forward-thinking energy policies under both Democratic and Republican administrations.\The lesson for New Hampshire's leaders is clear: If we want a secure, predictable path to meeting our 21st-century energy needs while adding jobs, containing costs and protecting our environment, the answer does not lie in massive energy imports from abroad but in clean renewable energy generation at home.\There are three simple steps lawmakers in Concord can take this year to move New Hampshire forward to a brighter energy future.\First, state representatives should join their counterparts in the senate by lifting the artificial 1 MW net metering cap that currently constrains clean power generation. The bipartisan Senate Bill 446, which Gov. Chris Sununu has pledged to sign, would allow cities and towns to put capped landfills and other polluted public lands back into use for both revenue and renewable energy.\Second, lawmakers should update group net metering guidelines under another bipartisan bill, SB 321, so solar customer-generators can offset multiple meters while maintaining competitive energy supply.\Finally, state senators should join their colleagues in the house by protecting the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, under HB 559, and the crucial incentives it provides for energy efficiency. Already those incentives have helped thousands of Granite State businesses and families – especially those on low incomes – cut costs and carbon emissions.\These steps, together with raising the state's Renewable Portfolio Standard from its measly 0.7 percent solar requirement, will send a clear signal to the clean energy industry that New Hampshire is open for business. It is time we looked past Northern Pass to homegrown energy independence and a brighter energy future.\(Dan Weeks is Chair of the Nashua Environment & Energy Committee and Director of Market Development for ReVision Energy in Concord.)"
147,"
Thanks to work that has already been done, New Hampshire might be slightly ahead of the game as the world figures out how to act in the wake of the weekend's sweeping agreement in Paris designed to contain the worst effects of climate change.
\
That doesn't mean, however, there isn't much more for New Hampshire to do, researchers who have followed the issue for years said.
\
""New Hampshire can take advantage that we have the freedom to not have to worry about strict compliance . . . because of what we've done with RGGI. . . . We can look at what can we do to become more of a leader,"" said Clay Mitchell, a lecturer on energy issues at the University of New Hampshire and co-founder of Revolution Energy, a solar power firm. ""We can say now we're going to show you how a state that doesn't have a lot of fossil fuels can take off and become a leader in domestic renewable energy.""
\
In particular, argued UNH professor Catherine Ashcraft, the Paris accord should draw the attention of private businesses.
\
""It does send a strong signal to the business community that there is an international effort to shift away from fossil fuels within several generations, maybe by 2060 or so, and that investments in the renewable energy sector will pay off, as compared to investments in the fossil fuel sector,"" said Ashcraft, who teaches classes in environmental policy in the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment.
\
""I think that this agreement signals that even so-called bridging fuels like natural gas look like a poor investment,"" Ashcraft said.
\
The agreement is likely to play a part in discussions on several public policy issues in New Hampshire in the coming year, including whether to raise a cap on net metering that reduces incentives for solar power, as well as the future of such contentious matters as the proposed Kinder Morgan natural gas pipeline and Northern Pass power line bringing Quebec hydropower to New England.
\
Ashcraft said private commitments made during the conference may be as important as government commitments.
\
""There were some really strong commitments in the private sector. Businesses are actually asking for a strong policy framework to enable them to move to green economy. If the business community is asking for investment in renewable energy and policies to support that . . . it is very important,"" she said.
\
""I thought it was a very strategic, a smart way to bring it together. It's more focused on the whole development of this quote-unquote new economy around renewable energy,"" Mitchell said.
\
This past weekend, representatives from 195 countries adopted by consensus an agreement to fight climate change, including an effort to largely abandon fossil fuels this century and keep global warming ""well below"" an increase of 2 degrees Celsius (about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit) since the start of the industrial age and, if possible, keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The accord came out of what is called the COP21 meeting of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change.
\
COP21 puts New Hampshire in a relatively good space because the Clean Power Plan being implemented by the Obama administration would largely meet the nation's goals for at least the next few years. And New Hampshire can meet its Clean Power Plan goals because of changes that have been spurred by its participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI.
\
Among the possible results from COP21 would be an extension of carbon-trading systems like RGGI that might even, Ashcraft said, allow the nine-state RGGI program to trade with overseas carbon markets. New Hampshire's experience with RGGI ""could give it a leg up,"" she said.
\
Ashcraft said her biggest surprise from COP21 was the inclusion of the 1.5-degree limit, prodded in part by a coalition of ""vulnerable countries,"" including small island nations that face devastating loss from rising sea levels.
\
""I'm not that surprised, but I'm happy. Even the best-laid plans, things can go wrong. The organization behind this was really tremendous,"" she said of the negotiations.
\
One difference from past climate change conferences ""was really the level of transparency. A lot of countries emphasized that they really felt this was their agreement. There was a lot of ownership. They were able to track progress,"" she said.
\
COP21 still needs to be ratified by at least 55 major polluting countries. The Obama administration argues that ratification does not require a vote from the U.S. Senate, which would almost certainly balk.
\
The pact, like most issues associated with climate change, causes a sharp partisan divide, with many Republicans opposed to any action and many Democrats supporting the idea, at least in theory.
\
U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte is unusual as a prominent Republican who supports the Clean Power Plan. Ayotte has not put out a statement in support or against the COP21 deal. Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat who is vying for Ayotte's Senate seat, lauded the Paris agreement in a statement sent immediately after Saturday's vote.

148,"Maine's independent Sen. Angus King has something few lawmakers possess: A deep understanding of how energy markets operate thanks to years as a utility executive and energy entrepreneur, prior to his political career as governor and senator from the Pine Tree State.\He's using that knowledge to propose a complete overhaul of federal energy regulations something he believes is long overdue for a system that hasn't changed much since the days of Thomas Edison.\King is promoting a bill that will give ""power to the people"" new meaning, as he envisions a future in which anyone could be a power producer and rate options for electricity are as varied as cell phone plans.\Environment and Publishing's Energy Wire put it this way in a May 6 profile: ""Senator with energy chops champions disruptive technology.""\The Free Market Energy Act of 2015 is designed in large part to referee the fight that is now emerging between regulated utilities and companies like SolarCity, which recently arrived in New Hampshire with a goal of promoting widespread use of rooftop solar.\""The utilities should view this as an opportunity to adopt new business models,"" King said in a recent interview. ""The old business model of central generating plants with transmission wires and passive customers is simply going to change as the price of solar, storage batteries and other distribution technologies comes down.""\In some states, like Arizona, so many people have adopted rooftop solar that the utilities have started to take notice. Starting in April, solar users across Arizona are subject to an additional rate charge of about $50 per month to support the fixed costs of the transmission and distribution system in the state.\The charge basically erodes the savings from solar, according to critics, in an attempt to stem the tide of conversions and preserve the profitable utility model.\National guidance\King says he's paying attention to those developments, but his legislation was not motivated by any particular event.\""It was simply my knowledge of these issues, and a growing awareness that this disruptive technology is going to change the way the utility business looks,"" he said. ""If there isn't some national guidance, it will end up conflicted from state to state, and I think this is so important to the future of our country that it should be dealt with on a national level, leaving discretion to the states as to how to interpret and work with the criteria that the bill establishes.""\The bill establishes a ""right to sovereignty over personal energy choices."" It would require utilities to allow solar connections in a reasonable time-frame, with charges that are ""just and reasonable.""\In determining those charges, utilities would have to account for the benefits to the grid when customers convert to solar, not just the benefits of the grid to the customers.\If states choose not to go that route, the bill directs that solar installations be classified as qualified energy facilities under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), and net metering would be required.\Under net metering, the owners or renters of solar installation pay only for the power they've used from the grid, ""net"" of what they've generated on their own. While New Hampshire currently offers limited net metering, many states do not.\If made into law, the act would encourage smart meters that enable time-of-day rates, and require states to consider lowering demand on the grid through solar as an alternative to costly transmission upgrades.\Big, new idea\King hopes to have his bill included as part of a bipartisan energy package proposed by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. ""She hasn't made any commitments,"" he said. 'This is a big, new idea, so I am hopeful we can get it into the bill, but I wouldn't make any predictions at this point.""\The utility interests are well-funded and well-represented by lobbyists.\""There undoubtedly will be some pretty powerful opponents,"" King said. ""But these changes, particularly the growth of solar, are inevitable as the price falls and the battery technology evolves. The real question is whether we are going to adapt to that in a proactive and beneficial way for everyone, or have lower level warfare.""\Meredith Hatfield, the governor's director of energy policy and planning, says what King is proposing is not inconsistent with the direction New Hampshire is already taking.\""A smarter, more flexible grid that allows customers more choices helps keep customers on the system,"" she said. ""If we don't help the utilities become more modern and flexible and responsive to our needs, that could drive more people off the grid. So it's in everyone's interest to make sure that ratepayer dollars are being invested in a way that supports the future.""\dsolomon@unionleader.com\Credit: By DAVE SOLOMON"

When Betsy Janeway and her husband, Harold, built a new barn next to their Webster farmhouse this spring, adding solar panels to the roof made sense. For the past 30 years, they have invested whatever time and money they could to reduce their impact on the environment - hanging each load of laundry out to dry, growing much of their own food and now adding a $20,000 system to power their house with solar energy.
\
""It's a way of life,"" Betsy Janeway said. ""It takes discipline. But I've loved it. I've always lived this way.""

The Janeways are part of a growing number of people in New Hampshire and other states who are choosing to invest in solar power. The solar industry has long been seen as too high-priced and complex for the average consumer, but some experts say that is changing. Federal tax credits, better technology and soaring oil prices are prompting more consumers to take interest, they say, which will eventually drive down the costs of going solar.
\
Of all the energy consumed in the United States, solar is still by far the smallest energy source at less than 1percent, according to the Energy Information Administration. But the number of solar panels being manufactured and sold in the United States nearly doubled from 2003 to 2004, the most recent data available from the Energy Information Administration.
\
""Unlike the late 1970s and '80s, this technology has a lot of history behind it now,"" said Brad Collins, executive director of the American Solar Energy Society, based in Colorado. ""This is not just being done by a handful of do-it-yourself, off-grid, back-to- landers or isolationists. It's grid-tied. It's at your public school, on your church building, part of the university at your local college.""
\
Harnessing the sun
\
The 20 solar panels mounted on the Janeways' barn roof can produce 2,452 kilowatt hours of electricity a year, which is roughly half of what the average household uses. Silicon photovoltaic cells in the panels cause a chemical reaction when the sun hits that produces an electrical current. The panels are then wired to an inverter that turns the current into the type of electricity used in homes.
\
The systems - including the panels, the inverter and the wiring - cost between $20,000 to $40,000, depending on the energy needs, said Laura Richardson, president of the New Hampshire Sustainable Energy Association. Some systems can completely eliminate the need for any electricity from a utility company; others choose to stay connected to the power grid because it can be cheaper.
\
""The cost of a solar electric system is about the cost of a car,"" said Richardson, who has a $30,000 system to power her house in the White Mountains. ""Putting it in perspective, most of your readers will probably have cars - they will have made the choice to invest in that because they feel its important for whatever they do in their life. A lot of the people that have invested in photovoltaics (solar power) feel that cleaner energy or reliability is that important.""
\
The Janeways had already made their home extremely energy- efficient over the years, so they were able to spring for a smaller system. The electricity bill for their sprawling farmhouse is just $37 a month. They anticipate that once their solar system is working, they will be able to produce all the electricity they need.
\
The Janeways' is one of 100 solar rooftops in New Hampshire for a total of 162 kilowatts of electricity being generated by solar each year, according to a 2005 study done by the state Office of Energy and Planning. Nationwide, roughly 100,000 buildings are powered primarily by solar, according to the American Solar Energy Society.
\
Bob Cote, a Deerfield resident who just built a new house with a $30,000 solar power system, said going solar makes sense because the equipment is guaranteed for 25 years. This, he said, locks in the cost of solar while the price of traditional electricity will continue to rise.
\
""We (Cote and his partner) believe that the country just generally needs to be more energy self-sufficient,"" Cote said. ""A lot of people are kind of just waiting for the government or somebody to act. We wanted to be proactive and decided there's something we could do on our own.""
\
A growing industry
\
Solar technology has been around since the 1950s, but it wasn't until the 1970s that it started gaining popularity. Soaring oil prices prompted major developments in the industry, but it never took off. During the 1980s and 1990s, solar never grew to be more than a ""garage industry"" made up of small business players and avid environmentalists, according to Joshua Levine, a project developer for Tamarack Energy, a renewable energy company based in Manchester. Tamarack got into the solar industry this winter.
\
In the last two years, solar has made a big comeback, he said, prompting companies like his to get involved. Now Tamarack Energy is working on funding for several solar power projects in Massachusetts, where more state incentives are offered.
\
High oil prices and more government incentives have prompted interest in solar to grow across the country at the same time scientists have made breakthroughs in the efficiency of solar panels, Collins said. Federal tax credits, which were adopted as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, have helped spur the growth, he said. Homeowners who put in a solar power system can get a tax credit for 30 percent of the cost of the project, with a $2,000 limit. Businesses get a tax credit for 30 percent of the cost of the project with no cap. There are also smaller federal incentives for making energy-efficiency improvements to your home - the list is posted on the state website, at nh.gov/oep/programs/energy/ renewableenergyincentives.htm.
\
States that offer additional incentives have seen intense growth, Collins said. In New Jersey, he said, where homeowners and businesses using solar systems can earn money for each watt of electricity they produce, the number of systems has doubled this year, he said.
\
One of the major challenges holding the industry back is a supply shortage of the silicon used to make the panels but that is temporary, Collins said. Silicon manufacturers have plans to build more plants in the next two years and when they come online, the cost of installing solar systems should drop, he said.
\
One common misconception people have about solar is that the weather in New England is a drawback, Richardson said. There is plenty of sunshine and backups in place for long stretches of gray, she said.
\
Batteries store electricity for times when the sun isn't shining and generators kick in when all else fails.
\
Making it work
\
In New Hampshire, the option of staying connected to the power grid - which the Janeways have chosen - has made solar more attainable for the average person, Richardson said.
\
The electricity generated in the Janeways' panels is wired underground to their home and to the Public Service Co. of New Hampshire power grid. That means that on bright days, when the Janeways are producing more electricity than they need, they send it back to PSNH for credits. Then on rainy days, when they are not producing electricity, they are able to cash in on those credits through a program called net metering.
\
Net metering allows homeowners who go solar to eliminate expensive batteries that must be purchased to store electricity on the good-weather days for times when the panels aren't producing. They also need a generator on hand, just in case.
\
At PSNH, the state's largest electric utility, 57 homeowners and businesses have joined the solar net metering program in the past decade it has been offered, according to Tod Wicker, PSNH manager of non-utility generation.
\
""It's moving into the mainstream as it becomes more economical,"" Wicker said. Net metering has helped, he said.
\
Depending on which town solar users live in, they may also qualify for a local property tax exemption for installing a renewable energy system. The latest count by the state Office of Energy and Planning, in 2003, found 56 New Hampshire communities offer the property tax exemption.
\
The Janeways will not qualify for a local property tax exemption because Webster doesn't offer one, but they will get the $2,000 federal tax credit.
\
Richardson said consumers need to be aware that the incentives available will not cover the cost of a whole system. A consumer has to be willing to make a substantial investment, she said.
\
""For me, payback was the first day we started making power,"" she said. ""You do have to pay attention, but I don't pay an electric bill now and that's pretty sweet.""
\
For people interested in just adding a panel to cut down on energy costs, it isn't really a practical option, she said. The bulk of the cost comes from the inverter, the wiring and the rest of the system that is still necessary to get the power from the panel to the home.
\
There is a new product being offered by a Maine solar company called Solar Market in Arundel. It's a plug-in solar unit that costs $5,000 and produces less electricity than a refrigerator uses. Naoto Inoue, one of the owners of the company, said he's hoping more people would be willing to make the smaller investment for the greater good of the environment -a concept he believes will be easier to sell than getting $30,000 to $40,000 systems to catch on.

Concord is looking into whether it makes sense to install at least 1,000 kilowatts of solar panels, one of a number of proposals across New Hampshire that reflect solar power's growth from the state's historically low levels, and also how the field is dependent on tax credits, subsidies or utility payments.
\
""That's the only way I see any of these projects working, with some sort of assistance,"" Concord City Manager Tom Aspell said Thursday.
\
The city has asked firms to bid by Oct. 8 on the project, which seeks to put at least one megawatt of photovoltaic solar panels - roughly the amount of electricity used by 200 homes - near either the city's wastewater or water-treatment plants, both of which are major users of electricity, or on the capped landfill at Old Turnpike Road, which has plenty of open space where nothing else can be built.
\
The winning bidder would lease the land from the city and own the panels, taking advantage of state renewable energy credits that support solar power and federal tax credits. The electricity would be sold to Concord under a 20-year arrangement known as a power purchase agreement.
\
The potential sites were chosen by Beacon Integrated Solutions, a Boston-based consultant hired by the council in December, and reflect common locations for municipal solar projects. Peterborough, for example, is about to turn on a one-megawatt facility at its wastewater treatment plant, while a number of closed landfills in Massachusetts are being covered with solar panels.
\
The Concord proposal also seeks bids on building smaller solar projects - less than 100 kilowatts total - for other city buildings. Those would not sell any excess power back into the grid, but would be small enough that all their power output would be used by city government.
\
Details about paying for any project would depend partly on where it goes, said Aspell. The roughly $34,000 used for the Beacon consultants was paid 50 percent from the general fund and 50 percent from the sewer fund.
\
Any addition of solar power by the city would reflect a relative growth in New Hampshire.
\
A new report by Environment New Hampshire Research & Policy Center said that solar power capacity in New Hampshire grew a whopping 149 percent last year, the third-best rate in the country. But this success has a caveat: New Hampshire was able to report large percentage increases only because it was starting from a very low base.
\
By Environment New Hampshire's measure, even after the strong growth New Hampshire has the lowest amount of total photovoltaic solar power of any of the 32 states in the report, and at a per-capita rate it had less than half the solar power of Maine and less than one-25th the amount of Massachusetts or Vermont.
\
Advocates say this is a reflection of New Hampshire's relatively weak support for solar power compared to neighboring states. New Hampshire has a price cap of $55 per megawatt for what are known as renewable energy certificates, paid to power generators for renewable energy, which is less than one-third the price in Massachusetts, for example.
\
New Hampshire also has a relatively low cap of 50 megawatts statewide for net metering, under which utilities pay owners of solar panels for excess electricity they send into the grid, and that cap is almost full. Without net metering payments, solar panels become less financially attractive.
\
In a conference call Thursday, Jonathan Gregory from ReVision Energy, a company that has grown from three employees to 100 in New Hampshire and Maine over five years, said that the net metering cap in particular needed to be raised by the state. He also warned about the federal Solar Investment Tax Credit, which is set to shrink or expire in 2016, depending on the size of projects, unless Congress changes its mind.
\
""This growth could come to a screaming halt without legislative action,"" Gregory said.
\
The Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, which sets state-by-state limits on carbon pollution from coal and gas power plants, is another incentive for solar energy. According to Environment New Hampshire research, solar power could easily meet about half the pollution reduction targets required by the plan.

151,"Monitor staff\Republican Kelly Ayotte and Democrat Maggie Hassan don't see eye to eye on most issues – including the first bill each would file if elected to the U.S. Senate.\Ayotte, the incumbent, said if she returns to Washington, she would focus on improving veterans health care and holding the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs officials accountable.\If Hassan makes it to the Senate, she said she would prioritize emergency federal funding for the drug crisis to fund treatment and recovery.\The women are facing off in one of the most competitive races in the country, which would tip party control of the U.S. Senate. Polls show the pair locked in a dead heat.\The first bill Ayotte would file in the new U.S. Senate is one to make permanent the Veterans Choice Card program, she said.\The card lets veterans get private care on the government's dime if they are stuck on long waitlists or live more than 40 miles from a VA medical center. Congress funded a pilot program after reports showed veterans languished in line for care. Ayotte's bill would also strip bonus pay from VA employees “who are guilty of misconduct.”\“When veterans return home, it's up to us to ensure they receive a hero's welcome that includes consistent support and access to timely and quality care,” said Ayotte, whose husband, Joe Daley, is an Iraq War veteran.\Hassan, a two-term governor, has watched drug deaths in the state soar. In the U.S. Senate, Hassan said she would push for emergency funding for addiction services to get dollars to treatment and recovery providers, law enforcement and prevention efforts.\The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act was signed into law this year, promising a boost in services. But a companion measure submitted by Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen for roughly $600 million in emergency funding was defeated in the Republican-led U.S. Senate. New Hampshire's drug overdose deaths have skyrocketed from 326 in 2014 to 439 last year, with a new record expected to be set in 2016.\“Emergency funding for the heroin and opioid crisis would be my first priority if elected to the United States Senate,” Hassan said in a statement.\While the candidates don't agree on all of the issues, one thing they share: Both are rising stars in their respective political parties.\Ayotte has been the state's top elected Republican since winning the U.S. Senate seat in 2010. Her name was floated as a possible vice presidential pick during the 2012 election. In Washington, she has carved a name for herself as a foreign policy hawk, often aligning with Arizona Sen. John McCain.\Hassan is the state's second female governor, elected to the post after serving six years in the state Senate, including two as the Democratic majority leader. She considers Shaheen a mentor who helped get her into politics when she was advocating for her son, Ben, who has cerebral palsy.\Independent voters will likely decide the race. As a reflection of that, both women are running to the middle. Ayotte and Hassan cast themselves as bipartisan problem solvers who can work across the aisle and aren't afraid to stand up to party leaders.\But the candidates' stances have at times angered members of their own party.\Ayotte, who is anti-abortion, raised conservatives' eyebrows when her campaign handed out free condoms to college students last month. And her decision to back a federal plan to cut carbon emissions in 2015 drew criticism from some Republican voters and the Koch-founded organization Americans for Prosperity.\Hassan, meanwhile, faced pushback from her party when she became the only Democratic governor out of more than two dozen nationwide to call for the U.S. to stop accepting Syrian refugees in wake of the Paris terror attacks.\The two face off in the final debate of the race on WMUR at 7 tonight. Here are some of the other issues:\Foreign policy \The pair's major disagreement is over the Iran nuclear deal, which lifted some sanctions on the country in exchange for new limits on its nuclear program.\Ayotte has called the deal dangerous and opposes it. She wants a reauthorization of sanctions against the country.\Hassan, like many congressional Democrats, says the agreement is “imperfect” but the best way to prevent a nuclear Iran.\Ayotte was one of 47 Senate Republicans who in 2015 signed a controversial letter warning Iranian leaders that the next president could reverse any deal the country struck.\“The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time,” read the open letter, a rare intervention by senators into diplomatic efforts. The White House accused the group of undermining foreign policy.\While Ayotte has tried to paint Hassan as weak on foreign policy, the Democrat has fended off such attacks by taking a hard-line stance on national security.\Both women oppose President Obama's plan to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, where most detainees are held without charges. Obama released the blueprint in February. It called for the transfer of about one-third of the remaining 91 detainees to other countries. The remainder, designated too dangerous for release, would be relocated to a new U.S. facility.\Hassan has called the plan too generalized, and said it doesn't take security into consideration. Ayotte said the plan could allow dangerous detainees back onto the battlefield.\The women both support additional airstrikes in Syria. Hassan said she does not support the deployment of a large-scale U.S. ground force in the country.\“It would be a mistake right now to launch another large-scale ground invasion the way we did under the Bush administration,” she said in a statement. “But we need to be constantly re-evaluating the progress on the ground and ensure that we are doing what it takes to wipe ISIS off the map and protect America's vital interests.”\Ayotte said the decision should be based on what military leaders recommend.\“The decision whether to deploy U.S. service members into harm's way is one of the most serious decisions we confront as a nation,” she said in a statement. “It is a decision I do not support lightly or hastily, and I believe it should be based on the situation on the ground, the advice of our commanders, and our national security interests.”\Guns\In the wake of mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., and Orlando, Fla., Congress has debated new restrictions on gun purchases but has taken little action.\Gun policy represents one of the biggest divides between Hassan and Ayotte, who split on whether the government should expand background checks or put restrictions on certain firearms. Currently, only licensed firearm dealers have to run checks on prospective buyers.\Hassan supports Senate Democrats' proposals to expand background checks for purchases online and at gun shows. And she has called for an “appropriate, fair assault weapons ban.” Attempts to pass such proposals have been defeated in the Republican-led U.S. Senate.\Ayotte has voted against past bills to expand background checks, saying the government should instead “fix the current system.” She supports further prosecutions of gun crimes and increasing mental health records given to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.\Federal law prohibits people committed to a mental institution from owning a gun, but it doesn't require states to submit that information to the NICS. New Hampshire is one of a handful of states that doesn't submit those records.\Both women have taken actions on gun policy that have angered some constituents.\As governor, Hassan faced criticism from Second Amendment activists when she vetoed bills to remove a state license requirement needed to carry a concealed gun.\Ayotte faced criticism in 2013, when, in wake of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, she was the only New England senator to vote against expanded background checks.\While the candidates agree the government should prevent suspected terrorists from buying guns, they're spilt on the method.\Hassan backs Democratic proposals to limit gun sales to people on the federal terrorist watch list. Ayotte joined most Senate Republicans last December to block such a proposal, but she reversed course this summer and voted for the bill. It failed to advance.\Opponents argued the list was too broad and didn't give due process protections to those affected.\Ayotte later signed onto a bipartisan bill restricting gun sales to people on the federal government's no-fly list, a smaller subset of the terror watch list made up primarily of foreign nationals. Known as “No fly, no buy,” the measure has yet to get Senate approval. \Economy\New Hampshire doesn't have its own minimum wage and instead relies on the federal rate of $7.25 an hour. Hassan favors raising the minimum wage to $12 an hour, while Ayotte thinks the best way to increase pay is by growing the economy. The federal minimum wage was last increased in 2009, from the previous $6.55 hourly rate.\The candidates also differ on tax policy, but both are proposing major reform. Ayotte supports lowering federal business taxes by dropping the corporate and individual rates.\Hassan supports expanding the child tax credit and establishing a new $1,000 tax break for middle-class families making less than $200,000. She would pay for it by cutting off tax subsidies enjoyed by major oil companies, a proposal that has been blocked in the past by Senate Republicans.\The women support different versions of a bill meant to close the gender pay gap. Hassan backs a Democratic proposal known as the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would let female workers in certain cases sue for salary discrimination.\Ayotte submitted her own plan to address pay equity last year that bars employer retaliation against workers who discuss their wages and those who decide not disclose salary history. Ayotte's bill, known as the Gender Advancement in Pay Act, doesn't go as far as the Democratic bill.\Health care \Ayotte has voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and calls it unaffordable for many New Hampshire families. She has said she wants to restore and expand health savings accounts and double flexible spending accounts, which let people save their money tax free to cover health care costs.\Hassan says the federal government should “build on the progress” of the Affordable Care Act because it has allowed people to get insurance coverage who have preexisting conditions. She supports repealing the medical device tax.\Hassan supports federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a health care and abortion provider that runs five clinics in New Hampshire. Ayotte has voted to block federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Ayotte has sponsored a bill to make birth control available without a prescription, but the legislation came under fire from Democrats who say it undermines rules that mandate insurance coverage of contraception. Ayotte disputes the claim.\Environment\Both candidates oppose a carbon tax and support the Environmental Protection Agency plan to cut carbon emissions.\Ayotte supports energy efficiency and further research into renewables, like solar power storage. She believes in an “all of the above” energy approach, which relies on renewable energy and on fossil fuels.\Ayotte, along with most Senate Republicans, supported the Keystone XL pipeline, which was rejected by Obama in 2015.\Hassan has advocated for ending federal tax subsidies for major oil companies, investing in “green-energy technology” and creating a national model rule for net metering, which lets homeowners sell their excess solar power to electric companies.\The women differ on Northern Pass, a controversial transmission line set to run through New Hampshire. Ayotte has called for full burial of the project, set to run overhead for about two-thirds of the 192-mile line. Hassan said she supports additional burial. But she thinks blasting required for undergrounding in some areas could be more environmentally damaging than putting the line overhead.\Social Securityand Medicare\Hassan pledges to fight efforts to privatize or cut Social Security, which is expected to become insolvent within 20 years. Hassan is open to adjusting the payroll tax cap so wealthier citizens pay more into the system. She hasn't been specific about how much the threshold should be raised.\Ayotte has said she supports a bipartisan solution on Social Security that maintains benefits for the retired and preserves the program for generations to come. The Republican is open to so-called means testing, or reducing benefits to high-income participants, but said she doesn't have any specific numbers in mind. She has also voiced support for adjusting the payroll tax cap, but hasn't been specific about the threshold.\(Allie Morris can be reached at 369-3307 or amorris@cmonitor.com.)"
152,"It's time for a new legislative majority\Like most New Hampshire residents, I want my representatives in Concord to exercise common sense in voting on public issues. It would also be nice if they checked with the folks back home for our opinion before making significant changes in our state government.\I was unhappy to learn that the Democratic majority of state representatives, in a party-line vote, approved $400 million in higher state taxes. Mind you, they started with a healthy rainy day fund, and state tax revenues are already higher than expected, thanks to wise fiscal and tax policies enacted by the governor and previous state legislative majority. So why did they need to vote for all these higher taxes?\ Democrats didn't need to do this. All that was needed was a little Granite State family common sense, like you don't spend more money than you have. The governor gets it; what's wrong with the state representative majority?\It may be fun for them to spend other people's money, but the added tax burdens they voted for will fall on the backs of ordinary folks in New Hampshire, and I, for one, do not appreciate the extra taxes. Thanks to low taxes, our state economy has been growing the fastest of any state in New England. Hiking state taxes isn't going to help this growth continue.\ If this is the way our state representative majority thinks that public business should get done in Concord, then it seems to me that we may need to elect a new legislative majority next year.\MARILYN L. HUSTON\Keene\(The writer is chair of the Cheshire County Republican Committee.)\Net metering bill veto was the right decision\With his veto of the net metering bill (House Bill 365), Gov. Chris Sununu took a stand for the average N.H. taxpayer. With per capita income in our state at roughly $38,000 per year, renewable energy may be out of reach for most of us.\A recent study revealed that 79% of taxpayers who take advantage of the electric vehicle tax credit make over $100,000 per year. That makes it a tax break for the well off. (Fully 70% make over $199,000.)\The governor's veto of HB 365 will forestall yet another tax break for the wealthy – an increase from 1 to 5 megawatts in the size of renewable energy installations that qualify for net metering.\Some will say that municipalities and schools benefit from this bill and will therefore save taxpayers money. But those taxpayers save money only by shifting costs, such as those for renewable energy certificates, to electricity ratepayers in other communities. This bill exempts new renewable installations built after July 1 from the statewide education property tax, adding even more to the burden of other taxpayers.\According to the New York Times, China has 2,300-plus coal-fired electricity plants and 1,100-plus under construction. The U.S. has 365 and none under construction. As long as this imbalance remains, nothing N.H. or U.S. policy makers do will have any impact on our global climate.\The governor was right to protect N.H. ratepayers from these ineffective policies by vetoing HB 365. The House should sustain this veto.\MICHAEL VOSE\Epping\Don't weaken definition  of ‘pet vendor' in N.H.\New Hampshire has some of the weakest animal protection laws in the country. Groups representing breeders are happy to keep it that way. They are opposing the new “pet vendor” definition in the N.H. budget amendment that requires all pet vending entities that transfer over 25 animals per year be held to the same reasonable standards of animal care.\I attended the first Christina Fay trial (80 Great Danes seized) and saw photographs showing the deplorable conditions in which this “expert” breeder kept these animals, heard eyewitness testimony that was even more graphic, and listened when the defendant took the stand and claimed that she'd done nothing wrong and that the Wolfeboro police and community were “out to get her.” I also heard statements to the effect that the reason she came to New Hampshire was because of our weak regulatory laws for dog breeders.\The recent Bradford case (105 golden retriever dogs and puppies seized) is only another example of why we need stronger regulation of dog breeders. Sen. Jeb Bradley and others have bent over backward to listen to stakeholder concerns for the last few years, but the AKC and its members have opposed any reasonable regulations of their members irrespective of the harm to hundreds of animals and a cost of more than $4 million to N.H. towns and nonprofit animal welfare organizations.\So, here's my plea to the N.H. Legislature: Please do not weaken the proposed definition of “pet vendor.” It's easy to enforce and just makes sense.\ELAINE R. WARSHELL\Moultonborough\In Concord, it's time for accountability\The city of Concord is in the news a lot these days, and not for the better. The Concord Monitor, Patch, the New Hampshire Union Leader, Boston TV and WMUR are all reporting on the handling of the case of accused sex-abuser and former special education teacher Howie Leung.\While there is talk that Concord High School Principal Tom Sica is on the outs, as of this writing no one has lost his or her job.\We the citizens of Concord cannot let this matter rest. We must demand school leadership, school board members and school administrators be held to account.\Secrecy has become all too comfortable in our city and was additionally manifest in a “covert” $5,100 purchase for “surveillance technology” by the city council. Some have surmised this purchase is for software to ping cellphones – but we citizens are not even allowed to learn the vendor's name.\It is time to end our school board's unique, autonomous status, politically diversify our school and city boards, and insist on the full truth.\CHUCK McGEE\Concord\Where is the  advantage, Governor?\Regarding the governor's position on paid family medical leave: He views it as another tax on the good citizens of New Hampshire, and that he will not tolerate. In much the same way, he vetoes the net metering bill because of its supposed deleterious effect on the N.H. ratepayers.\Yet, in the same breath, he raves about the “New Hampshire Advantage” and the lowering of business taxes as being beneficial to our state's economic growth. Where is that N.H. advantage when it comes to families having to take unpaid leave to support each other? What advantage do we have if we continue to support a policy that promotes fossil fuels and downplays biomass, solar and other alternative energies? Whom does this governor truly support: big business or the common person? If we are seen as a wealthy state, why isn't that reflected in our education? In our broader health care system? In our concern for others?\Hope you like your insulated office, Governor, isolated from the neediest and our increasingly polluted environment, because your policies, your vetoes, are not for the good of all, and you need to go in 2020.\JANET MOORE\Andover"
153,"
It is great to see when elected officials from both political parties come together in Concord to solve pressing issues, like they did last week when they joined together to support the rapidly growing solar industry in New Hampshire.
\
Over the past several months, Republicans and Democrats have collaborated and worked through many differing perspectives to find a path forward for solar energy in our state. We believe that HB 1116 - legislation that passed the House Science, Technology and Energy Committee unanimously and was voted on by the full House last week - offers a common-sense solution to enable continued clean energy development that benefits all New Hampshire residents.
\
Frustrated by the high cost of electricity in our state and region, homeowners, businesses and municipalities are increasingly looking to invest in solar options in order to produce their own power, stabilize and lower their energy bills, reduce their carbon footprint, and become more self-sufficient. Over the past several years, new and improved products and opportunities have become available that provide consumers with the ability to switch to solar in a cost-effective manner - and thousands of Granite Staters are taking advantage. The examples of solar growth can be seen in every corner of New Hampshire - from panels appearing on rooftops in our neighborhoods, to larger arrays in old mill complexes, to municipal projects on capped landfills.
\
This increased demand is generating more solar jobs in our state.
\
According to a new report by the Solar Foundation, solar businesses in New Hampshire supports about 730 jobs - an incredible increase in jobs in just the past few years. While the number of solar jobs in New Hampshire is currently second to last among the New England states (Maine has the fewest), the growing demand for cost competitive, clean energy in New Hampshire indicates there is strong growth potential for the industry - precisely the clean technology jobs our economy needs.
\
While the future of this industry certainly looks bright, there is much concern that its growth in New Hampshire could be slowed - if not stopped - by the failure of the Legislature to take adequate action to ensure its survival this year.
\
Lawmakers are currently faced with two related problems that need to be solved: statutory production caps that threaten to shut down the growing industry, and concerns about reimbursement rates paid for solar energy that is sold into the grid. HB 1116 addresses both of these concerns.
\
Several decades ago, the Legislature placed a cap on the amount of energy that could be generated and sold back into the grid by the then-fledgling solar industry. This process is called net metering and exists in many states across the nation. While the cap was more than adequate for many years, the rapid demand for solar projects over the last few years meant that the cap would be reached and solar development threatened. In fact, in some New Hampshire utility service areas, the cap was reached last fall, effectively shutting down new solar development in parts of the state.
\
The House committee that worked on HB 1116 came together to create a transition plan that will lift the solar cap to a new level where the industry can feel confident that it can continue to meet the needs of customers in our state. The committee was responsive to the concerns of solar developers and customers who want to ensure that the new cap is adequate to meet the continued growth in customer demand.
\
While HB 1116 provides for an adequate cap, it also establishes a process to make sure that the reimbursement payments for solar power producers are fair to all electric customers - regardless of whether they own solar. All of those involved in this process agree that more study and information on the benefits and costs of solar needs to be done to ensure that the net metering rate available to solar producers is fair to all customers. HB 1116 does this by providing the state's Public Utilities Commission guidance and an expedited timeline to complete an analysis, and follow their existing public processes to make reasonable adjustments to the rate and net metering cap.
\
Finally, we understand that some of the utilities who have a monopoly to provide electricity may feel threatened by the rise of solar and the growing demand of homeowners who want to take advantage of their own power generation in order to control costs. The energy future of New Hampshire will look much different than the business models of the past. The Legislature and our state agencies need to do more to bring the traditional utilities and the growing solar industry together in order to make real progress on these issues.
\
For the benefit of our economy, environment and for New Hampshire ratepayers, the Senate needs to follow up the good work of the House and pass HB 1116 to make sure that the solar industry continues its strong growth and bright future in the Granite State.

"
154,"CONCORD Durham resident Amanda Merrill, who served two terms as a Democratic state senator and 11 years as a state representative, was recently appointed by Gov. Maggie Hassan as director of the Governor's Office of Energy and Planning.\She replaces Meredith Hatfield, who left in early June to take a position with a Boston-based charitable foundation. Hatfield, who was appointed in 2013, was an attorney with legal experience at the Public Utilities Commission, where she had served as consumer advocate.\Merrill's experience is more on the legislative side.\She was on the energy and natural resources, public and municipal affairs, and wildlife committees in the Senate, and the environment and agriculture and science, technology and energy committees in the House.\Merrill has served on the Durham Planning Board and as a board member of the Granite State Conservation Voters Alliance, the Audubon Society of New Hampshire and the New Hampshire Preservation Alliance.\She received her Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology from Dartmouth College and her undergraduate degree from the University of New Hampshire, and took over as director of Energy and Planning on June 20.\The OEP is responsible for the state's 10-year energy strategy, fuel-assistance services and land conservation programs....Since so much of your experience is in the state Legislature, what's your voting record on some of the key energy and land conservation issues?\In the House, I ended up serving on the Science, Technology and Energy Committee and quickly became involved in efforts to promote energy efficiency, which has been a theme of mine, something I worked on in both the House and Senate.\I supported HB 1392 in 1996 (legislation calling for restructuring of the electric utilities). In fact, I was a co-sponsor.\I was not in the Legislature in 2006 when the scrubber was mandated (at the Merrimack Station coal-fired plant in Bow) as part of the multi-pollutant bill, but I heard SB 152 in 2009, as a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. This was the bill calling for a PUC investigation of whether the scrubber was in the public interest of retail customers. I voted inexpedient to legislate, with the majority, 21-1.\Your predecessor was one of the main negotiators of the recently approved settlement that will result in Eversource selling off its power plants. Do you think the terms are fair to consumers?\I do think that it came out a fair settlement. One way in which the Office of Energy and Planning will continue to be involved is with the development of the $5 million clean energy fund coming out of the settlement. I've already had a few calls from people who want to talk about the best ways to use that money.\Where do you stand on the state's net metering program, which sets a cap on solar installations eligible to sell energy back into the grid at the full retail rate?\I think the current cap is too low, but where it should be, and what the rate should be, I can't say right now. That's one of the dockets they're working on over at South Fruit Street (offices of the PUC).\I would point out that one of the roles of this office, not just on net metering but on other issues, including divestiture, is to be a facilitator.\In the case of net metering, for example, we are not in the solar business and we are not a utility, so we are a party that can play a useful role in bringing both of those parties together.\Do you agree with the Business and Industry Association that it's become too difficult to site new energy projects in New Hampshire?\It's never going to be an easy process. There are many factors to consider in terms of balancing business interests, environmental concerns, etc., so it's understandable that some people see this as being too slow, but I'm not sure how much of that can be avoided without compromising the kind of review that we want to see. It's a balancing act.\What's your top priority on the energy front?\A long-standing interest of mine has been promoting energy efficiency. I'm also certainly interested in the role of renewable energy. But for me, energy efficiency has always been at the top of the list of what I would like to see more of here in the state. I understand the extent to which that's going to happen is enmeshed in other discussions.\What's the biggest challenge facing the state from a land-use perspective?\It would be keeping New Hampshire the kind of place it is ... protecting its natural resources, while recognizing that there is a balance in terms of what we're going to use our land for and use our resources for. We have a beautiful state with incredible natural resources, and we want to protect them."
155,"For the Monitor\When my family first joined the Republican Party in the 1800s, they were conservatives in the original sense of the term. As farmers and businessmen, soldiers and public servants, my forebears were intent on conserving New Hampshire's most precious assets, from our land and water to our self-reliant way of life.\The first John Weeks was elected to Congress in 1828 as a member of the original Republican Party, defined by its Jeffersonian embrace of rural life and against a centralizing aristocracy and corporate corruption. He is best known for leading an 1820 expedition into the White Mountains, which resulted in the naming of New Hampshire's highest peaks. He died in the shadow of that Presidential Range at the same time a young Illinois congressman named Abraham Lincoln was helping found the second Republican Party.\Decades later, another Republican John Weeks of Coos County would make his name in Congress as author of the Weeks Act of 1911, establishing the Eastern National Forest as a landmark in land and water conservation. In a letter to his son (my great-granddad) Sinclair Weeks, who would follow in his footsteps as a senator and secretary of commerce under President Eisenhower, John summarized his notion of principled, pragmatic leadership: “A man is a leader, legislatively, when he knows more than those who are serving with him. He does not need to be an orator, have wealth or any other qualifications than to have the facts.”\Although their time has passed, the time for such a brand of fact-based conservatism in Congress and Concord has not. Indeed, all I know of these three men and the conservative tradition out of which they came leads me to believe they would follow the science and act with urgency to conserve our common home for future generations, were they faced with today's climate crisis.\Against this backdrop, I have been saddened to see New Hampshire's Republican governor question climate science and pressure his fellow “conservatives” in the New Hampshire House and Senate to sustain a slew of vetoes denying climate action this week.\When asked about climate change in a 2016 gubernatorial debate, Gov. Chris Sununu stated simply, “No, I don't believe in it.” To back up his position, Sununu provided the following perplexing logic from his position as then-CEO of a family-owned ski resort: “I don't believe in (climate change) because I know we might have had an awful mild winter this year, and we saved an awful lot of money in our snow budget, but I can tell you that next year, we may not be as lucky.”\Even more perplexing are Gov. Sununu's oft-repeated assertions that “I'm an environmental engineer” and “you've never had a governor with the experience that I bring to the table . . . when it comes to understanding the environment and climate change.” An NHPR investigation subsequently found that Sununu was never licensed as a professional engineer, never sat for the exam and more than a decade has passed since he worked in the field of civil or environmental engineering – small comfort for a citizenry that overwhelmingly accepts the scientific consensus on global warming.\But denying scientific fact and exaggerating your own credentials are one thing; blocking the will of the people when it comes to conserving New Hampshire's natural environment and way of life is something else.\Which brings me to House Bill 365, the bipartisan bill to raise the net metering cap for homegrown renewable energy projects and cut climate-warming carbon emissions, which was vetoed by Gov. Sununu and narrowly failed an override vote this week.\In the ordinary course of events, this bill would be anything but controversial. It passed the New Hampshire House with over 70% support for the second year in a row (including dozens of Republican backers) and won a unanimous voice vote in the Senate. It is a top priority for environmental advocates and the clean energy industry, which employs thousands of Granite Staters and brings billions in local investment to increase our self-reliance and energy independence.\Beyond the usual suspects, the policy is backed by many of the state's leading businesses seeking to offset their high electricity rates with homegrown renewable energy, who gathered at the State House this summer in advance of the governor's veto. Dozens of New Hampshire cities and towns have also called on Concord to raise the arbitrary cap so they can turn old landfills into solar farms while saving taxpayer money and combating climate damage.\Most importantly, surveys find that fully 85% of registered voters nationwide – including seven in 10 Republicans – support far more aggressive climate action than a 5 MW net metering cap: requiring utilities in state to produce 100% of their electricity from renewables by 2050 rather than the measly 0.7% currently sought from solar.\Yet in spite of this overwhelming public and legislator support, HB 365 died this week after numerous Republican representatives switched their votes under pressure from Gov. Sununu. According to multiple reports, Sununu told a closed-door caucus of Republican lawmakers that sustaining his veto wasn't about the issue or the people of New Hampshire – it was about him. He even went so far as to attack New Hampshire's fledgling solar industry as “crony capitalism at its worst.” Did he forget the tens of thousands of dollars he has raised from fossil fuel companies and utilities? Or does he remember them all too well?\The time has come for a return to the old tradition of fact-based conservatism and a Grand Old Party that places conservation at its core. After all, what could be more conservative than preserving this one and only planet we call home by stemming the climate crisis before it is too late?\(Dan Weeks is a director at ReVision Energy, an employee-owned solar company in Brentwood. He lives in Nashua with his wife and kids.)"
156,"For the Monitor\With New Hampshire paying some of the highest energy bills in the country, it's no surprise that the issue's front and center in this year's campaign for governor.\The two Democratic challengers in the race – former state Sen. Molly Kelly of Harrisville and former Portsmouth Mayor Steve Marchand – have highlighted energy relentlessly this summer as they've touted their commitment to renewables and slammed Republican Gov. Chris Sununu on the issue. Sununu has spotlighted that he's fighting to reduce energy prices for ratepayers.\A new TV ad by Kelly that hit the airwaves on Wednesday targeted Sununu for his controversial vetoes last month of two bills that would have aided the renewable energy industry.\“We're getting slammed with higher electric bills,” Kelly said at the top of the commercial, as she spotlighted the governor's vetoes and more than $50,000 in contributions Sununu's received over the past several years from Eversource – the state's largest utility.\“Eversource is making huge profits,” Kelly argued in the commercial. “The governor? He collected more than $50,000 from Eversource and vetoed two renewable energy bills.”\One of the two bills the governor vetoed would have required Eversource and other utilities to buy power from independent biomass power plants. The other measure would have expanded net metering – which provides small generators credits for the electricity they send to the power grid.\In Sununu's first ad of his re-election campaign –a digital spot released earlier this month titled “axing the biomass tax” – he said his goal was to protect ratepayers.\“I will never stop fighting for New Hampshire's ratepayers – from individual families to the small businesses that power our economy – because it is simply the right thing to do,” he said.\The narrator in the commercial added that “when foreign and out-of-state biomass companies asked for $30 million a year from New Hampshire taxpayers to bail them out, Gov. Sununu said no.”\After Sununu's veto, three biomass plants announced plans to close or shutter operations, which has sent ripples through the timber industry in the North Country.\As for the net metering bill, Sununu said last month that he vetoed the measure because it amounted to “a handout to large-scale energy developers.”\In her commercial, Kelly touted that she “led the fight to expand clean energy and create jobs.”\Earlier this month, all but two of the state's 13 mayors agreed to back a letter asking legislators to override Gov. Chris Sununu's vetoes of two energy-related bills on Sept. 13, saying the vetoes hurt their communities.\“We believe strongly that clean and local renewable energy and greater efficiency in how we use all energy will be vitally important to our cities' future economic vitality and environmental quality,” the letter states.\While Kelly and Marchand have repeatedly criticized Sununu's contributions from Eversource, the Democratic contenders – who face off in the Sept. 11 primary – have traded fire this summer over past energy contributions that both candidates accepted.\For his part, Sununu made energy a major issue in his successful 2016 run for governor, Sununu highlighted his civil and environmental engineering degree from MIT, his years after college working as an environmental engineer cleaning up waste sites, and his more recent tenure running the Waterville Valley ski resort. He also spotlighted his strong support for Eversource's controversial and now stalled Northern Pass hydro-electric transmission line proposal.\Since taking over in the Corner Office at the beginning of last year, Sununu's come under attack for his stance on climate change. Democrats slammed him for refusing to join at least 20 other states in pledging to uphold the Paris climate agreement following President Donald Trump's controversial decision in the spring of 2017 to back the United States out of the accord.\“Not at this time, especially when we do not yet know its impact on our economy and environment,” Sununu said at the time.\Sununu's comments to NHPR last summer also grabbed attention. Asked if him believed that carbon emissions were the leading cause of climate change, the governor answered, “I don't know for sure.”\And this spring, critics pointed to Sununu's “state energy strategy,” which emphasized more reliance on nuclear and gas over renewable energy.\While the issue's in the spotlight on the campaign trail, it will also be front in center in Concord early next month, when lawmakers return to the State House to try and override the governor's vetoes of the renewable energy bills.\That showdown will come less than two months before election day, as New Hampshire's first GOP governor in a dozen years tries to win a second straight two-year term steering the state."
157,"The Capital City's goal of total renewable energy may be three decades away, but you wouldn't know it by the breakneck pace its energy policymakers have set.\\The city recently received kudos from the Sierra Club for its June commitment to 100 percent renewable energy by 2050 in its “Ready for 100%” report, a campaign the organization has been backing across the country.\The effort got plenty of praise close to home, too – the State Employees Association, the Unitarian Universalist Church of Concord and the Chamber of Commerce all endorsed the program.\“With its clean energy resolution in place and strong community support behind it, Concord must now carefully plan how the city will achieve these goals in a manner that takes into consideration the needs of all community members,” the report reads.\A big piece of the goal is developing a strategic plan a year out from adoption. But a more immediate policy is making its way through the city: a sweeping solar ordinance.\Crafted by the city's Energy and Environment Advisory Committee, the ordinance is in its early stages and will need to go in front of the planning board and the city council before anything is decided.\Here's some of what the committee is trying to accomplish:\Spreading solar around \Perhaps the biggest change would be to expand some level of solar to almost everywhere in the city.\The ordinance looks to allow solar as an accessory use in all zoning districts for buildings, carports and small ground-mounted projects, with small being defined as producing less than 100 kilowatts.\It would also define where solar projects of various sizes are allowed by conditional use.\Small-scale projects would be allowed downtown and in densely populated areas of the city, while large-scale projects would be allowed in industrial areas and open spaces.\No ground-mounted projects of any size would be allowed in the residential downtown, central business performance, civic performance and urban commercial districts – basically the densely developed areas of the city.\Pretty much everywhere else would be able to have some solar, depending on the zoning. Large-scale projects, defined as generating more than one megawatt, would be allowed only in the residential open space, office park, opportunity corridor performance, institutional, industrial and gateway performance districts.\The ordinance would also allow solar in the historic district, provided that it received approval from the Heritage Commission, is minimally visible and doesn't mar the historical aspects of a building.\Clearing up the solar process \Small projects and rooftop solar projects are already allowed by right in most areas, according to Assistant City Planner Beth Fenstermacher. But it's not explicit in the zoning codes, and the ordinance would clarify where zoning is allowed.\It would also direct the city to create a “one-stop solar permit,” where developers have to work off only a single checklist in order to understand what's required of them, and coordinate reviews of the application across city departments.\Perhaps one of the most significant changes would be to align Concord's view of impervious surfaces with Massachusetts's, whose model solar zoning exempts panels from lot coverage – the defining point in the West Portsmouth Street solar debate.\A proposed large-scale solar farm that would have sat on land rented from Brochu Nursery was rejected by the zoning board after a ruling earlier this year that solar panels count as impervious surfaces, basically the same as a roof over a warehouse, or a paved parking lot.\The project's developers, NextEra Energy, argued to no avail that the angled panels allow grass to grow underneath them and should not be considered impervious because water can still reach the ground.\Unmoved, the zoning board rejected the project again.\Although it's been months since the West Portsmouth Street decision, the impact is still felt. Fenstermacher said the city got a lot of feedback from residents on the issue, and said when it comes to larger developments in the city's rural areas, it's not just about impervious surfaces – it's about aesthetics, too.\“The biggest issues are the lot coverage and where it's going to go,” she said. “We need to reach out to those neighborhoods and see how they feel about it. Maybe some farmers to see if they're interested in leasing.”\Whether anything like the West Portsmouth Street project will come to Concord again after the sustained veto of the net metering bill is debatable. The bill would have expanded net metering from one megawatt to five megawatts, but was left on the chopping block two weeks ago.\Next steps \The city's planning board is expected to take up the ordinance in the next month or so, with a public hearing before the city council anticipated for December.\Fenstermacher said residents can look for a public input session sometime in the second or third week of October. If people want to give feedback before then, she encourages them to contact her by phone, at 230-3635, or by email at BFenstermacher@concordnh.gov.\ (Caitlin Andrews can be reached at 369-3309, candrews@cmonitor.com or on Twitter at @ActualCAndrews.)"
158,"Monitor staff\Dozens of bills came and went, but by the end of the week, almost nothing had changed. In attempt after attempt, the Democratic-led Legislature failed to override all but one of Gov. Chris Sununu's vetoed bills this week, with left-leaning lawmakers condemned to watching their creations fall.\But for some who don't hold elected office, the veto outcomes had more immediate effects. Advocates across the spectrum showed up at the State House this week, hanging on every step. Here are some of them.\Biomass goes bust\For Tom Thomson, owner of the Thomson family tree farm son of former Gov. Meldrim Thomson, the failure of one bill is already being felt. House Bill 183 would have delivered subsidies to New Hampshire's six biomass plants, which have been struggling in recent years.\If that sounds like deja vu it is: A very similar bill passed last year to do the same thing, requiring utilities companies to purchase biomass power at competitive rates. But a legal challenge brought to a Washington, D.C. agency by the New England Ratepayers Association – a Massachusetts-based advocacy group – has put those subsidies in jeopardy.\So members of the timber and biomass industry pinned their hopes to another iteration of support. House Bill 183 was set up to eke through the Senate, with 14 Democrats and two biomass-supporting Republicans – Sens. Jeb Bradley and Bob Giuda – ready to push it along.\And by a margin of four votes, the House declined to give the Senate the chance.\Now, Thomson and others say Wednesday's veto result could be the final blow for major parts of the industry. Facing difficulty competing with lowered prices from natural gas and out-of-state energy alternatives four out of six of the biomass plants are already in effective shutdown status, according to industry representatives.\Beyond the biomass plants themselves, the low grade wood that fueled them, and the industry that harvests that wood, will all be affected, according to Thomson.\“People are going to lose their jobs, equipment dealers … chipper manufacturers, probably the phone is ringing right now: ‘Cancel that order',” Thomson said.\Thomson, who has been in the forest management business for 63 years, says clearing out the low grade wood is essential to maintaining the health of his forests. The alternative, he said, is development.\“I can't practice sustainable forestry now,” he said. “There's no low grade market. And instead of growing trees, I'm going to start growing house lots.”\Shaun Legueux, president of New England Forestry Consultants, said the closure of biomass plants means no outlet for that wood product.\“This is a huge blow, because it makes it much more difficult for us to do the quality work that we've been able to do in these markets,” he said.\Legueux said that net effect, for foresters, will be “constrictions.”\“It's tougher for me to work on low grade jobs,” he said. “You can always sell a good product. (But) by selling that lower quality product, it actually has the biggest impact on the forest.”\Not all are shedding a tear, though. In recent years environmental activists have raised objections to biomass as a power source, pointing to the burning of wood as a pollutant.\In a letter to lawmakers last week, the state Sierra Club and a coalition of other environmental groups railed against biomass as unhealthy for humans, animals and the environment.\“For approximately 30 years, these plants have been operating as major stationary sources of pollution, including acid rain-causing sulfur dioxide, smog-causing nitrogen dioxide, mercury, volatile organic compounds, soot, heavy metals, CO2, and dioxin and other cancer-causing emissions,” the letter, first reported by the New Hampshire Journal, stated.\The group argued that solar net metering, offshore wind, and battery storage was better for promoting clean energy, and said that the biomass plants had not prioritized the necessary work to make their plants less polluting.\And they said any subsidies now would not keep the plants in business forever.\“Since HB 183 does not require improvements to their business strategy or require technology investments or other changes, it is likely that in three years these companies will be back at the Legislature asking for more hand-outs.”\Still, the veto Wednesday cut short a lifeline that plants argued could have kept them a viable member of the state's energy infrastructure and economy, particularly at times of energy scarcity in winter.\And on Thursday, the final hammer dropped. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) released a ruling finding that the New Hampshire law which overcame a veto last year is in violation of existing federal authority.\Prospects for the future of the industry are dimmer than ever.\Green energy and marijuana\For other activists in the State House this week, the outcome was a mixed bag.\Dan Weeks, a top official at the solar company ReVision Energy, and a former Executive Council candidate, had been leaning on House Bill 365, which would have expanded net metering to allow larger companies and towns to sell solar energy into the grid at higher levels. That would have helped his company, which helps supply the panels.\On Wednesday, Weeks showed up with a half dozen coworkers, toting white hard hat helmets and signs. The bill did not overcome a veto – it was six votes short. One bill the governor did sign this year, though: Senate Bill 165, which eases the process for low income communities to net meter off solar projects. So the upshot was mixed at best.\Aureus Humboldt, of Manchester, came with his father Rik for one specific bill: medical marijuana home grow. Both Aureus and Rik have conditions aided by medical marijuana, but both have struggled to navigate the medical bureaucracy necessary to obtain it in New Hampshire, they said. House Bill 364 would have allowed those licensed to receive therapeutic cannabis to grow up to three plants in their homes.\They didn't get it – the bill was ultimately quashed in the Senate. They did get one small victory: Senate Bill 88, which eased the ability to obtain medical marijuana ID cards by scrapping the requirement for a doctor patient relationship, and the one veto to be overturned.  But for Aureus, who has tried unsuccessfully for three years, it was cold comfort.“It costs me $1,500 a month to treat my condition,” he said. “I believe the right to  grow my own medicine is a human rights issue, not a legal issue.”"
159,"This series investigating the construction and financing of rooftop solar systems started in the mid August and is now its seventh week. We conclude today with an unfortunately negative observation as follows:\Subsidies to the rich: Green-conscious people purchase these systems with their own money along with state and federal subsidies and income tax credits that cover 35 percent of the total construction expense. If they can have a net metering arrangement with the local utility they can feel good about their effort to contribute to reducing this nation's dependency on fossil fuel. But they are also subsidized by those consumers without solar panels on the roof. The entire exercise amounts to a nice cocktail party conversation.\Cha-ching: The TV commercial that mimics the sound of a cash register does not signal money coming into your wallet if you bought the contract with no down payment. This is nothing but a financing deal. You have just signed a 20-year mortgage atop your mortgaged home property, and are tied up with a complex power purchase agreement, through which it is very difficult to discern if you are making money.\Trees and shade: A friend of mine in California installed a rooftop solar system 10 years ago. His neighbor planted a bunch of fast-growing trees along the property line. Now after 10 years, his panels produce very little electrical power due to the trees blocking the sun. In the winter the production falls to nothing. There have been some conversations between the two neighbors, but legally my friend can't force his neighbor to trim the tree.\Limitation: The United States has about 421,000 rooftop solar installations. The combined systems could produce the capacity of 8,452 megawatts of electricity. Under normal weather and seasonal conditions (accounting for nights and cloudy days) the power production would be in the order of 25 percent or less: roughly 2,000 megawatts. In order to produce that amount of power, we have spent roughly $13 billion to build the rooftop systems. That translates to $6,500 per kilowatt, far above the standard rate of construction cost of $4,000 per kilowatt, according to an MIT study.\Infrastructure: The power utility business used to be simple. The utility builds a large power plant and distributes electricity to thousands of consumers. When the utilities decide to accept the small amount of solar power generated by thousands of consumers, the network design must undergo a significant change to improve the system stability.\Advanced nations such as Germany, France and Japan experienced the problem of what one calls phase instability, and largely solved the issue so far. Germany and Japan had different reactions to the problem. German manufacturers such as SMA largely resolved the issue for now. A Japanese utility decided to refuse any further increase in solar generation connection.\One way or the other, this is leading to a high cost of infrastructure in the power distribution field worldwide. Further more, due to the net-metering arrangements some German utilities are faced with a serious cash crunch from the decline in revenue.\Conclusion: From the global viewpoint, there are 74 million stand-alone houses in this country. We need to pick roofs with right orientation. Only 20 percent are eligible to mount the solar panel on top. That is an optimistic figure as trees would grow to shade the panel in years to come. Twenty percent of 74 million is approximately 15 million homes, and if every home would install the system the total output capacity is only 60 megawatts, assuming only 15 percent of that is useful capacity. If all 15 million roofs are solar-paneled, the power we get is pitiful a 9 megawatts.\Interim solutions: The solar power generation system using photovoltaic panels become much more efficient as its panel surface area increases. Therefore, a large surface area system is much more preferable than the ordinary rooftop system.\If one could take a thousand acres of land on which to install solar PV panels, the plant would produce approximately 365 megawatts. The problem is that flora and fauna on the thousand acres of land would receive some seriously negative effects due to the solar panels. If trees have to be cut in place for the solar panel, we are basically exchanging the production of electricity against production of oxygen an unsavory environmental assault.\The world electrical energy consumption can be generated by a solar PV cell the size of Spain, 550,000 square kilometers. If splitting the area into 96 equal sections each being 57,291 square kilometers, the size of the solar cell system would be 75 square kilometers.\My suggestion is to develop 96 sectors of ocean each having 75 square kilometers, and generate roughly 100th of the world electricity demand. These units must be somehow floated on the ocean surface and must be engineered to coexist with the ocean ecology. One hundred of the 75 kilometer (46 mile) square floating island would produce what the world needs without much degradation to the environment, and this is the nearest solution currently available for the independence from fossil fuels.\Ultimate solution: I believe the ultimate solution for the energy generation issue for the world without causing any rise in the global warming is not to generate electricity on the Earth's surface, PERIOD. It has to be done in the outer space. There have been more than several proposals on this regard.\The basic schemes deal with a large solar panel satellite floating above the Earth, and generating electricity by solar PV panels. The power output is then converted to microwave energy, and it is then beamed to the specific point on the Earth. The microwave power reception system then transforms the energy into electricity on the ground.\These schemes, very executable in some near future, still need to convert microwave energy into electricity on the surface of the Earth, where another conversion heat would be generated. In our mind, use of two geosynchronous rings, offset by 90 degrees, of photovoltaic sensors at the altitude of 22,000 kilometers with width of only 600 meters would produce sufficient and constant electricity at all times. The power then is sent to the Earth through the ""space elevator"" without causing any heat rise. The Earth's surface will not generate any energy in this scheme.\The U.S. government canceled a tiny study contract at NASA of a mere $50 million for this very purpose. That $50 million is literally a trivial sum for the study to achieve such a beneficial goal for the mankind and the flora and fauna with which we share the Earth. I strongly suggest we resurrect the study contract and forge ahead to develop the geosynchronous solar rings. Yes, we can do it!\Finally I would like to thank the following individuals who helped me understand complex financial documents and other issues in regards to the rooftop solar systems. They are Mary Thron of Kittery Point, Maine; Suzanne Loder of Durham, David Borden, David McCardle, Tim Driscoll & Craig Strehl of New Castle, and Ron Scaggs of Thousand Oaks, Calif.\.\Shintaro ""Sam"" Asano of New Castle was named by MIT as one of the 10 most influential inventors of the 20th century.

160,"For the Monitor\I'll never forget the first thing I learned in Economics 101: There is no such thing as a free lunch. In the 20 years since that high school econ class, I have found the law holds true not just when it comes to lunch but also to gas in my car, electricity from the grid and everything else under the sun.\Except sunlight itself.\That's because the world's most abundant source of energy is not only insanely abundant – it can also be turned into electricity, free of charge, for anyone with a sunny patch of roof or land who is willing to make the now-modest investment in solar panels.\Just how abundant is sunlight, you might ask. In the hour it takes you to read the Sunday paper, planet earth will receive more power from the sun than the total energy we consume in an entire year, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. In fact, roughly 40 percent of our nation's electricity needs could be met through rooftop solar alone – creating millions of good local jobs in the process.\Here in New Hampshire, it would take less than 1 percent of our land dedicated to solar panels to harvest all 300 trillion BTU of energy we consume in a year, cloudy days and all. Which brings me to my own patch of roof in downtown Nashua.\Worried about high energy bills and the kind of planet we are leaving our newborn twins, my wife and I decided to go solar in 2016. One year later, we're happily still filling our plates at the solar buffet – and with plenty more sunlight to go around, we wanted to share what we learned with you.\Our journey began unexpectedly when we bumped into a representative of one of New Hampshire's 68 solar companies at a fair. Curious if solar could work on our old home, we gave the fellow our address and he pulled up a map on the spot. It showed a respectable amount of sun hitting our west-facing roof, in spite of the many tall trees around. So we scheduled a meeting.\A few weeks later, a solar designer stopped by to take pictures of our roof and attic and walk us through the process. It didn't take long to settle on a plan for 17, 327-watt photovoltaic panels, designed to fully meet our family's energy needs when averaged over the year. We signed a project agreement and left the fancy permitting and paperwork to them.\Next, a team of local technicians got to work on our roof installing the aluminum mounts, solar panels, wiring and inverters, along with a new meter to track the excess electricity we would be sending back to the grid. After two days of installation and a visit by the city inspector, the system was good to go.\Twelve months and several snowstorms later, our system is running without a hitch and we have yet to spend a dime on electricity. Instead, we pay the utility a standard $12 per month for the benefit of accessing power from the grid – our “battery” on cloudy days and when the sun goes down. The excess power we generate in summer covers our needs in full, thanks to net-metering.\While the electricity itself is free, the panels, inverters, meter, labor and 25-year warranty add up. At $12,500 after state and federal rebates, our system will take eight to 10 years to pay itself off. Then we can look forward to decades of free power, as the expected lifetime of our SunPower panels is more than 40 years. And in case we need to sell our house along the way, studies show that a solar system boosts property values by an average of $15,000.\What is the net effect for utilities and society at large? Although certain utilities are naturally resistant to change, the increase in energy supplies long-term can save them billions of dollars on power plants and inefficient transmission to meet peak demand – especially on hot summer days when the AC is on and solar power is at its max. As for society, the benefits are undisputed: a recent Citibank study puts the cost of climate change from burning fossil fuels at $44 trillion by 2060, many times greater than the public and private cost of building a clean energy economy.\But what if you don't own a home or lack the roof or yard space to harness the sun? Fortunately, there's another “free lunch” to be had in the form of energy conservation. Swapping those old incandescent light bulbs for LEDs could save you hundreds of dollars a year. The same goes for heat pumps, insulation, energy-efficient appliances, and heeding grandma's advice to turn off the TV and lights when you leave the room. You can even find a neighbor with some extra land and start a solar farm.\I recognize that “free lunches” can be few and far between, but with 5 billion years of sunlight on the horizon this one is here to stay. What better time to say goodbye to high energy bills and make it a clean green future?\\(Dan Weeks serves on the Nashua Environment and Energy Committee, whose purpose is to save taxpayer money and promote responsible stewardship of our local environment.

161,"Sununu's vetoes at odds with ‘good guy' image\A number of recent letters in N.H. newspapers have suggested that Gov. Chris Sununu is a “good guy” who likes kids and cares about the environment. His veto decisions of this past summer, however, point to the big difference between the governor we see at “feel good” events and the governor whose vetoes belie the image he projects.\He might be nice to small kids but he vetoed bills that would increase the likelihood that those kids go to schools that are gun free or that the families of those kids have access to real family medical leave. He claims to be concerned about our environment but he vetoed a bill to increase net metering limits. He talks about the fairness of our elections but vetoed a bipartisan bill to increase the likelihood that our representatives aren't coming from districts that are “rigged” by the political party that controls the state Legislature.\Regretfully, there is a big difference between the way Sununu acts in the corner office and the way he acts with a group of children. I appreciate his “nice guy-ness.” However, we need governors who support legislation that improves the lives of the people they smile at; not governors who talk about being concerned but then veto legislation that would show that the concern is real.\DAVID CAWLEY\Concord"
162,"New Hampshire, with some of the highest electric rates in the county, would on paper look like a logical market for SolarCity, the nation's biggest installer of rooftop systems for homeowners looking to cut their electric bills. With 190,000 customers in 16 states (17 if you count New Hampshire), the company targets states with high electricity costs and a favorable regulatory environment for solar.\The Granite State has both, and has seen consistent growth in the use of residential solar over the years, but not through the kind of leasing arrangement that SolarCity will bring to the state for the first time.\While it's possible to save money by leasing rooftop arrays, homeowners would be well-advised to do a lot of homework before signing the 20-year power purchase agreement that comes with the leasing option, especially given the state's volatile energy pricing and the uncertain future of its renewable fuels programs.\The market for residential solar in the state has, up to now, been fairly straightforward. Locally owned and operated ""mom and pop"" operations like Granite State Solar of Boscawen, with 14 employees, would design, sell and install rooftop or ground arrays to homeowners, who would finance the $15,000 to $20,000 project on their own or through a lender, sometimes with help from the installer.\The monthly payments on the solar array replace most if not all of the electric bill, with the purchase price offset by a $3,750 rebate from the state's renewable energy fund. On top of that, the homeowner, as owner of a renewable energy resource, is eligible for renewable energy credits that can be sold to utilities at rates that generate quarterly checks in the $400 to $500 range.\Homeowners also qualify for a 30-percent federal tax credit for solar systems they've purchased.\When SolarCity owns the array, SolarCity gets the rebates, sells the renewable energy credits and enjoys the federal tax advantages that it shares with a ""tax-equity partner.""\Buying a better option\Although leasing accounted for 80 percent of the new installations nationally in the past year, the biggest leasing company of all, SolarCity, admits that buying is the better option.\""I totally agree with that,"" said Shaun Chapman, senior director of policy and electricity markets for SolarCity. ""Unfortunately the pool of people who have $15,000 lying around and can utilize that is limited.""\SolarCity also has a buy-to-own program, but that will not be available in New Hampshire, at least not initially.\The SolarCity leasing pitch of ""no money down, and guaranteed savings"" is appealing, and is apparently working on a large scale. The company has an A-plus rating from the Better Business bureau, with 163 closed complaints on a customer base of nearly 200,000.\But New Hampshire may prove inhospitable to the leasing model for a variety of reasons. The first is the state's extremely volatile energy costs.\Under the leasing agreement, SolarCity will guarantee you a rate per kilowatt hour that is lower than the current utility rate and lock it in for 20 years, with annual increases up to 2.9 percent, and will pay you the difference if you don't achieve the promised savings.\But if utility prices go down, you could actually end up paying more than your neighbor who does not have solar panels on his roof owned by a third party. As unlikely as that may sound, there are many people in New Hampshire, the governor included, who believe prices must go down as a matter of economic necessity, and there are several initiatives under way with that goal.\The state's regulatory environment for renewables is unpredictable. New Hampshire is one of 43 states with a market for renewable energy certificates, but has the lowest price $55 per megawatt versus $285 in Massachusetts and they could go away at any time.\Question of commitment\Even if the certificate program remains in place, there's no guarantee the state Legislature won't raid the fund, as the House is attempting to do this year, and leave nothing for solar subsidies.\The state's participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which also helps solar programs, comes under fire in virtually every legislative session.\""In New Hampshire, the economics of leasing just don't add up,"" said Erik Shifflett, co-owner of Granite State Solar. ""I don't know how SolarCity is going to make that work. They are not going to be generating as much revenue from their RECs (renewable energy certificates), and if they are not generating it from the RECs, how are they going to pass the savings along to the customer?""\Then there's always the possibility that the Public Utilities Commission in the state will impose new charges on the owners of solar systems to force them to pay their share of maintaining the distribution system, either through a flat monthly fee or a distribution charge based on volume, which could further reduce savings.\The Legislature is considering those very options now as it mulls the future of the state's ""net metering"" program, in which solar owners sell surplus electricity back into the grid.\Chapman says the incentives and subsidies are important, but not essential to long-term customer savings.\""Is there a commitment to these policies in the state Legislature? We hope that there is,"" he said. ""We hope that they see this technology through to its full maturation. We want some certainty and stability. But our business is focused on how quickly we can bring down the cost, anticipating a day when there is no subsidy, no tax credits, whenever that day may come.""\With so many variables in play, ""A Homeowner's Guide to Solar Financing: Leases, Loans, and PPAs,"" published in February by the Clean Energy States Alliance (CESA), ought to be required reading by anyone considering solar as a way of escaping the state's crushing energy costs.\dsolomon@unionleader.com\Credit: By DAVE SOLOMON"

Over the past few years, I've gradually weaned myself off of watching television (except occasionally PBS) so these days I no longer have to watch the often ridiculous ads that demonize nearly every candidate.\I urge all voters to both turn off the TV and immediately recycle the mud-slinging mailers that are sure to fill our mailboxes in the next few weeks. Do your own research, whether by reading candidate comparisons in reputable news media or reading the positions of the candidates on their websites. Hang up on the robo-calls that are sure to come every evening on your phone. Don't click on the web links that look like attack ads.\As an independent voter and having done my research on the candidates in Senate District 8, I'm voting for Jenn Alford-Teaster. Not just because I've known her for 15 years and respect her integrity and her passion for helping others, but because her positions on health insurance, public education and environmental issues are right for our citizens and our state. I know Ruth Ward a bit, and respect her, but I'm looking to vote for a candidate that I know will not automatically support the predetermined positions of his or her party, but prioritize what's best for the people and environment on which we depend.\PAUL DOSCHER\Weare\We need Alford-Teaster\This is why I am supporting Jenn Alford-Teaster for District 8 Senator: New Hampshire's legislative demographics are skewed toward retirees and the wealthy. We need someone who can speak to the interests of families and younger residents who don't see their needs being addressed in Concord: schools, taxes, day care, health insurance and family leave.\Jenn has impressive credentials, a young family, boundless energy and a personal interest in everyone she meets. Her thoughtful and creative policy positions support N.H. families. She spends her weekends canvassing the district, visiting parts never seen before by a Senate candidate. She demonstrates what new energy and perspective she can bring to the Senate. We don't need more of the same in the state Senate, we need someone who will represent the people.\On Nov. 6, get out and vote for Jenn Alford-Teaster for state Senate District 8.\MARALYN DOYLE\Newbury\Vote for Cox in  Warner and Webster\On Tuesday, Nov. 6, citizens of New Hampshire will, once again, go to the polls to vote for the candidates they think might make a positive difference in managing our country's and our state's affairs.\Terry Cox of Webster is one such candidate. Terry is running to represent the towns of Webster and Warner, District 7 in Merrimack County. She'll be the first representative to actually live in the 7th district (Warner/Webster) since Lloyd Stone in 1959. Terry is presently the secretary of the Merrimack County Republican Committee.\I know Terry Cox to be an intelligent woman of unquestionable integrity and honesty with a fantastic and relentless work ethic. She doesn't quit until the job is done, and done right. Terry wants work-study programs for plumbers, electricians, auto mechanics and the other trades. Her focus will be on non-STEM work study and jobs for young people in an effort to retain young workers in New Hampshire. Further, Terry Cox will work diligently to reduce the costs of energy. Presently, our electric and oil heating costs are some of the highest in the United States.\Terry Cox will also fight for smaller government and to protect our constitutional rights.\Please cast your vote for Terry Cox on Tuesday, Nov. 6.\TIMMY DILLON\Concord\Support Karrick in  Merrimack District 25\We are writing this letter to express our support for David Karrick, who is running to represent the towns of Andover, Danbury, Salisbury, Warner and Webster in Merrimack District 25. We are impressed with David's intelligence and his priorities.\David is an experienced legislator, having served as a District 25 representative for four years and as a selectman in Warner. David will be responsive to the concerns of all his constituents, unlike our current representative.\David's positions on the issues facing New Hampshire are pragmatic and ideologically neutral. He understands that the state funding contribution for public education for grades K-12 is unsustainable, and that previously reduced state funding for tuition for UNH and for other post-high school educational institutions must be increased to provide tuition relief for in-state students.\David will work toward solutions to many lingering problems that affect quality of life, including affordable comprehensive health care; obtainable clean energy, including the removal of limits on net metering; obtainable statewide high-speed internet and broadband service.\On the Republican agenda for 2019 are the continuing suppression of voting rights, reduction of access to comprehensive health care, privatization of education and corporate tax relief. David's opponent publicly states that she is aligned with Americans for Prosperity – an outside Koch brothers organization devoted to cutting business taxes, removing business regulations (especially energy regulations) and privatizing education. None of these goals benefit us, the people.\Please join us in voting for David Karrick to represent us in Merrimack District 25.\MARIE D.

164,"(Last week, we asked readers this question: “What single, achievable action do you believe would make the biggest difference in the fight against climate change?” Here are the responses we received.)\Stop funding the fossil fuel industry\Here is my answer, and it is not original. You can just follow the money and the answer to the question the Monitor has posed becomes clear. Bill McKibben wrote at length about this very same question in a recent New Yorker magazine article. What we need to do is to stop funding the fossil fuel industry. Lenders, insurers and investors need to stop funding and investing in the fossil fuel industry. People are mad. Some people are afraid. It's time to do something really meaningful that will accomplish a rollback to the speed with which our planet is being degraded by greed.\\CLAUDIA DAMON\Concord\We need a carbon tax\What single, achievable action do I believe would make the biggest difference in the fight against climate change? A carbon tax, applied to everything, no exceptions. It's the only universal and effective way to reduce carbon loading of the atmosphere.\PAUL HAGUE\Weare\Elect leaders who recognize the threat\David Brooks, a.k.a. Granite Geek, I don't want to say you burst my bubble (“Solving the ‘act globally' equation,” Monitor front page, Sept. 17), but frankly, you burst my bubble!\My individual efforts to reduce, reuse and recycle are not just a drop in the bucket of our efforts to avert climate change, they are a mere drop in the ocean of the efforts needed! Here we are in a small city (certainly by global standards) in a small state, but we are sitting right next to a coal-burning power plant that contributes in one hour more CO2 than I do in a quarter century, even before I start zealously reducing my own energy footprint!\Clearly, the solution is much higher up the chain of command. When we have a governor vetoing every single effort to reduce CO2 emissions, from nixing efforts to encourage our fledgling solar industry to vetoing the net metering cap, it's inescapable that we need to act politically. When we have a president who is so beholden to the fossil fuel industry that his idea of progress is to loosen every restriction on auto emissions states like California have struggled heroically to achieve, and to tear down every protection of our air, water and land previous administrations have put in place (which admittedly were only a bucketful in the ocean to begin with), we need to act politically.\So I believe that acting politically to elect leaders who recognize the threat of the climate crisis at least as well as our young people do is the single, most basic step we must take. But I think that is only the first step. In terms of actually slowing climate change we need to cut emissions in our transportation system, our biggest source of CO2. That means not only improving efficiency, but switching to clean energy. Our sun sends us clean power daily. In contrast to the dismal performance of our local power plant, our sun sends in a single hour all the energy the world and all its inhabitants use in a full year. Harnessing solar energy is happening now, but only with political and individual effort will it become more efficient, more affordable and more universal. Solar power needs to light our pathway forward. I'm going to continue to do my part to make that happen, and I encourage you to do yours.\MILLIE LaFONTAINE\Concord\Rethinking rebuilding\I was really happy to see David Brooks's column about our global crisis. His use of simple (not really) math to show that individual, well-meaning, conservation activities won't get the job done proves that it will take agreement and cooperation by all the world's countries to slow down global warming. You'll notice I didn't say stop the warming. Mother Nature has her own agenda and right now it is a warming trend. Nothing we can do about that, just accept it and plan for it.\Now to the question: You asked for a “single, achievable action” in the fight against climate change. The word achievable is the daunting challenge. Some will say my thought means surrendering to the inevitable, and I would say it means simply retreating, but here goes.\We need immediate state and nationwide legislation that prevents anyone from rebuilding, on the same footprint, all homes and businesses, sewage treatment plants, parks, etc., that are destroyed by hurricanes and/or rising sea levels attributed to global warming. Take the insurance money and, perhaps, some modest government assistance and rebuild on higher ground. Drastic? I don't think so.\For example, when New Orleans was devastated by Hurricane Katrina, why were people allowed to rebuild in an area where much of the city was originally built below sea level and protected (?) by levees. This idea won't fly well with those along our shores who want their piece of heaven protected by walls or other barriers (built by others, of course).\The town of Hampton recently took a baby step in the right direction by adopting a regulation that new buildings in certain areas must be built on stilts, in recognition of rising sea levels and future storms.\Sadly, it will be a long time before China and India, two of the world's worst polluters, join the team to seriously address this global issue so we might as well act locally while others talk globally.\GIL ROGERS\Bow\Pricing carbon\The single best action we can take to combat climate change would be to pass a carbon tax, or a cap and trade system. The idea is to start with a fairly high carbon fee and have it steadily increase over time. Stop having endless battles over which coal power plants should close, or what the automobile mileage standards should be, or what types of light bulbs we should use. Let the market know what carbon will cost and then let market forces figure out the details. It is a concept that has support from conservative economists as well as from former Republican treasury secretaries, Federal Reserve chairs, and presidential economic advisers, as well as from multiple Fortune 500 companies. This should be achievable.\Two things stand in the way. The first is Republican control of the U.S. Senate. We in New Hampshire are not in a position to do anything about that because we already have two Democratic senators. All we can do is support Sen. Jean Shaheen next year and hope enough other states replace their Republicans with Democrats.\The other obstacle is President Donald Trump. Just about all of the Democratic candidates support taking action to combat climate change, with many of them supporting either a carbon fee or a cap and trade system. Our special position as New Hampshire primary voters gives us the opportunity and the obligation to try to figure out which candidates will go to the mat for this, and which candidates are saying the words but won't follow through when the going gets tough. And I think the going will get tough on this. It is going to take political courage and leadership to get this done.\When Lyndon Johnson signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act, he told an aide “We have lost the South for a generation.” He knew it was politically dangerous but he pushed it through anyway because it was the only morally defensible thing to do. We need someone with that kind of courage in the climate change fight.\STEPHEN RASCHE\Canterbury\Change your diet\If you're serious about protecting the environment, the most important thing that you can do is to stop eating meat, eggs and dairy.\Feeding massive amounts of grain (that humans could eat) and water (that humans could drink) to farmed animals and then killing them and processing, transporting and storing the products is extremely energy-intensive. And forests – which absorb greenhouse gases – are cut down and often set on fire to supply pastureland and grow crops for farmed animals. Finally, the animals themselves and all the manure that they produce release even more greenhouse gases into our atmosphere.\There have been countless studies proving that going vegan or “plant-based” is the single best way to reverse climate change. The U.N. believes that a global shift toward plant-based food is vital to combat the worst effects of climate change. Globally, animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gases than all the world's transportation systems combined. Combined!\An Oxford University study, published in the journal Climatic Change, shows that meat-eaters are responsible for almost twice as many dietary greenhouse-gas emissions per day as vegetarians and about 2½ times as many as vegans.\I am not saying that we shouldn't take other steps to help the environment, such as reducing our use of plastics and fossil fuel, but the easiest way to make a difference is with our fork. You can start at your next meal, your next night out, your next grocery shopping trip. If you care about the health of the planet, you can make a difference by what you put on your plate.\LAURA SCOTT\Concord\What can we do? Vote\ The big question: “What single, achievable action do you believe would make the biggest difference in the fight against climate change.” The big answer: Vote.\If we do not get the naysayers out of office, we have no hope. It is the one individual thing we can each do that will have a positive, global impact.\The Republican Party, unfortunately, has chosen to be the party of the past, clinging to fossil fuels. President Trump is no surprise. As a candidate he denied the science; as president he has shown repeatedly, by his reversal of environmental protections, that he cares nothing about the planet. Gov. Sununu, a self-proclaimed environmental scientist, was a surprise – to me anyway. When he first became governor of New Hampshire, I had really hoped that he would work to address the carbon problem. Instead, he is following Donald Trump's marching orders. Leaders do not walk around with blinders on. The world needs the equivalent of another Manhattan Project. Will the United States, finally, take the lead to address a global threat? This can only happen if we vote people into office who take this seriously. This is not “diddly-squat.”\We need to look at the records of all local, state and federal candidates running for office. Get the facts; then vote. It is the single most important thing we can do to address this, the biggest question.\How many canaries have to die before we wake up?\JEANNE CUSSON\Concord"
165,"Policies for a better climate future\Last month, I went to the Environmental Legislative Preview organized by the League of Conservation Voters. It was great to meet N.H. legislators like Senate Majority Leader Dan Feltes and other climate advocates and hear about upcoming legislation relating to re-authorization of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, net metering, Renewable Portfolio Standard, carbon pricing and water quality testing.\Coming off the heels of the recent release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, which urges that the “Earth's climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities,” building relationships with legislators on these issues is more important than ever.\We have a responsibility to protect our health, environment and future, and these policies have the potential to make concrete steps to reduce the effects of climate change.\SHIRLEY COLBY\Concord"
166,"For the Monitor\In light of the challenges we have faced as a nation in responding to the COVID-19 crisis, public health experts have been discussing the “panic-neglect cycle” of America's preparedness (or lack thereof) for a pandemic. For even longer, there has been a similar dynamic at play when it comes to our energy policy. And with fossil fuel prices now temporarily depressed, it is easy to fall back into the “neglect” camp. However, if history is any judge, this crisis too shall pass, and with it, the low energy prices that we are now witnessing.\As tragic and disruptive as the COVID crisis has been, we are fortunate that this is unfolding in the spring as opposed to fall or winter or coinciding with extreme weather. Competing with power outages or high heating bills in addition to all of the other stresses going on would have made this so much worse (spiking gasoline prices caused the first dominos to fall during the Great Recession).\However, with energy normally used at work or school shifting to our homes with all the computers, dishwashers, lights and other electricity-consuming households appliances running much more than they were a few months ago, households are bearing an additional financial burden because of the COVID crisis just as incomes are decreasing or disappearing all together.\During the depths of the Great Recession, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act invested in energy efficiency and renewable energy, not only jump-starting hiring but also serving as a catalyst for the adoption of new technologies. What better way to put people back to work now than making improvements that lower household energy costs, improve air quality, keep energy dollars circulating in our local economy and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels shipped in from out of state or out of our country. Another benefit of such investments is that energy expenses become more predictable and stable for the system as a whole and much less impacted by the vagaries of international energy markets.\By making capital investments now, which will result in lower electricity and thermal energy demand in the future, we can do our part to strengthen our state, our region and our country so that we are less vulnerable when the next crisis comes. There is even an existing source of funding that could pay for such an initiative: the $5 million Clean Energy Fund established through Eversource's divesture of generation assets in 2017. These funds have been sitting idle while how to put them to work is debated, with one idea being to use them for loan loss reserve for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. This is far from the most impactful way these dollars could be used, and in this recessionary environment, it is naïve to think this would entice new lenders into making these very specific and esoteric type of loans.\It is time to make direct investments with some urgency for a clean and resilient energy future for New Hampshire. Labor is more readily available than it has been in years, there is hope a compromise can be reached on net metering legislation, and construction season has started. Let's put these dollars to work now.\(Kevin Porter of Concord is vice chairman of Clean Energy NH.)"
167,"Override vetoes, support energy independence\It's rare to have strong bipartisan support for a bill in the current New Hampshire Legislature. Two such bills, Senate Bill 365 and Senate Bill 446, passed this spring, but Gov. Chris Sununu has since vetoed them. These bills would have supported our state's energy industry and economy.\Thankfully, there is an upcoming opportunity for the citizens of our state to urge their elected representatives to support a different vision of our economic and energy future. If enough legislators show up in Concord on Thursday – the official veto day – their votes will override the governor's vetoes. The winners will be New Hampshire's forest industry, the state's ratepayers and large renewable energy projects.\SB 365 will help ensure that the state's six independently owned biomass plants keep operating. Without these generating facilities, more than $250 million in New Hampshire's economic activity will likely vanish. In place of locally generated electricity, our state will need to import more fossil fuels and shoulder an increasing share of the region's transmission costs, all of which will increase electric rates for New Hampshire consumers.\SB 446 increases the cap on net metering of electricity from 1 to 5 megawatts, thereby allowing cities, towns, businesses and schools to generate more of their own electricity from renewable sources. Projects around the state are waiting to be built, and a strong signal from state policymakers in support of renewable energy investments is good policy.\Ensuring that Senate bills 365 and 446 become law by overturning the governor's vetoes will support energy independence for New Hampshire and the innovation economy. Please make sure that your state senators and representatives are in Concord on Thursday to override the vetoes of these important bills.\ROB WERNER\Concord\(The writer is a city councilor and chair of the Concord Energy and Environment Committee.)"
168,"EVERYONE I KNOW is tired of working harder while keeping less of what they earn. That's why the recent decision by the state Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to implement an energy efficiency resource standard (EERS) is so distressing. By adding to our electric bill, they are nickel-ing and dime-ing us to death.The Union Leader editorial, ""False Promises: Efficiency won't cut energy use,"" perfectly described what economists call the ""rebound"" effect. When energy efficiency lowers the cost of energy, consumers use more of it, not less. The correlation between gasoline prices and large vehicle sales demonstrates this effect.The PUC decision increasing our monthly electric bill by implementing an EERS was a bad one on many other levels, beyond not lowering energy consumption.First, an EERS contributes to already high electric rates. The PUC's order authorizing the EERS acknowledges that energy prices will go up in the short term. Electricity prices in New Hampshire already suffer from the ""two cents here, three cents there"" problem of mandated charges for the regional greenhouse gas initiative (RGGI), the renewable portfolio standard (RPS), the systems benefits charge, and net metering subsidies, and now the EERS. Together, these mandates add dollars, not cents, to a monthly electric bill. Businesses and organizations such as the Business and Industry Association have complained for several years that this upward price curve for electricity hurts our state's economic competitiveness and stunts job growth. Why would the PUC want to contribute to that problem?Second, an EERS is grossly inefficient. During a presentation to the House Electricity Oversight committee in 2015, a spokesman for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) stated that an EERS would need ""to spend $3 to save $1."" Somebody will have to pay for that inefficiency. The more efficient methods for ensuring energy efficiency in the built environment would involve beefing up building codes, and performing outreach and education to consumers about its benefits.Finally, an EERS is unfair to our poorest citizens. Adding a few cents every month to an electric bill might not hurt many ratepayers, but those who live on fixed incomes or live paycheck-to-paycheck may not agree. Taking a few cents every month from every ratepayer and then redistributing that money to selected individuals who ask for it is socialism. Some can call socializing a preferred-outcome a benefit, but it will be an unfair burden to others.Individual ratepayers should make energy efficiency decisions based on their needs and means. Taking that decision away from ratepayers diminishes everyone's freedom of choice.The PUC should stick to regulating utilities and stop trying to fix what may not be broken..\Rep.

169,"For the Monitor\The Concord City Council recently approved a solar field near the Hall Street wastewater treatment plant, which will displace 15 of 39 acres currently used for farming in the city. Proponents of the project have offered reasons that ranged from financial to environmental.\First, they claim it makes economic sense to pursue the solar project, because the city will be able to purchase the electricity it generates at a fixed rate for the next 20 years, which is generally the lifespan of solar panels.\Of course, though, the price of that electricity will be higher than the city currently pays.\Although I appreciate the council's interest in ensuring against future rate spikes, they are hedging with taxpayer and ratepayer dollars as the solar installation will be heavily subsidized through federal and state funds.\The project is also dependent on New Hampshire's net metering law, which will allow the city of Concord to sell surplus solar power back to the grid at a rate greater than market prices. The excess cost of the electricity generated by the city's solar field, however, is then passed on to all electric ratepayers by their utility. This is a cost-shift.\ While Concord reduces its electric bill, it simultaneously contributes to increased rates for its residents and the residents of other municipalities in the utility's footprint.\The installation itself is funded through a state grant from the Renewable Energy Fund, which is made up of payments by electric service providers required to meet renewable power mandates.\In essence, the state requires a utility (Unitil in the capital region) to purchase higher-priced renewables, such as solar and wind, and when the utility doesn't meet its mandated quota, it must pay into a fund that proliferates even more solar power projects adding to a vicious cycle of increasing electricity rates.\The city council is robbing Peter to pay Paul.\Second, as reported in this paper, a city councilor said that the solar project is important for “symbolic reasons,” because the capital city should be “a leader in moving us to renewable energy sources.” This is an awkwardly inconsistent argument to make.\It suggests that the proposed solar project is good because it has a limited impact on the environment. However, the chairman of the city's own Conservation Commission, whose mission it is to protect, promote and develop the natural resources of Concord, raised concerns about the location of the project, its impact on agricultural land, and its potential conflict with the city's master plan.\I wonder if the owner of Green Gold Farm, who leases agricultural land from the city to farm and will lose much of it to this project, appreciates the symbolism.\Like several other municipalities pursuing solar projects, the city council thinks it has stumbled upon a good deal and free money. Unfortunately, nothing is free. The city's $1.7 million electric bill will be paid one way or another. As a resident, if I'm not paying for it with my property tax dollars, I'll be paying for it in my own electric bill if this project is completed. What's the difference?\New Hampshire has the fifth-highest electricity rates in the country. Solar generated electricity is not economical, and the policies enabling solar projects help only to perpetuate higher rates and cost shifting from one ratepayer to another.\Towns and cities don't like it when the state shifts costs to local governments, but in this case Concord doesn't seem to have a problem playing that game with electric ratepayers in this city and other municipalities paying the freight.\If each city and town in New Hampshire played this game, there wouldn't be enough ratepayer money to go around. Concord's taxpayers and ratepayers should be skeptical and proceed with caution.\(Jamie Burnett is a small business owner and resident of Concord.)"
170,"For the Monitor\From my experience in politics, I know it's always easy to say “No,” to simply “resist” or to lament what's wrong. I have always advocated a positive, proactive vision for change, not just what a candidate or a party is against. That's exactly what Senate Democratic candidates in New Hampshire are doing.\For the first time in anyone's memory, a party seeking control of the state Senate in New Hampshire has actually laid out priorities with a plan of action that clearly reflects New Hampshire values. I am thankful that Senate Democratic leaders Donna Soucy and Dan Feltes are leading the charge. Donna, Dan and their colleagues have laid out a positive, proactive agenda that fights for all Granite Staters. They call it the Granite State Opportunity Plan. I call it the “people versus the powerful.”\The plan calls for five things:\First, a common-sense budget: A state budget that puts people first and works for everyone instead of sending our tax dollars to private prep schools or lavishing tax giveaways on big, out-of-state corporations. Democratic Senate candidates are prioritizing common-sense investment in education, infrastructure, child protection, local jobs and health care, including combating our opioid and public mental health epidemics.\Second, jobs and opportunity: The plan proposes advance job training and workforce development to meet the needs of workers and businesses in this state, helping those in recovery get good jobs, helping people on second and third careers left out or left behind in this economy, and helping graduating Granite State seniors have vocational and trades opportunities.\Third, smart energy: The plan recognizes that an energy policy that focuses on energy efficiency and local energy projects means local jobs and lower electric rates. So, the plan focuses on energy efficiency for everyone and relaxing outdated net metering restrictions and obstacles holding back our clean tech economy.\Fourth, support families: The plan makes paid family and medical leave insurance a reality, because no one should have to choose between work and family – we need to value them both. Whether caring for a newborn, getting yourself or someone close you to you healthy, including opioid addiction, or being there when a loved one is passing away, family and medical leave insurance is critical to a healthy family and in making the state an attractive home for young people and new businesses. In today's economic environment, retaining the workforce of tomorrow is critical to the state's economic competitiveness, especially with Republican Gov. Charlie Baker moving Massachusetts forward aggressively on workforce development, including family and medical leave insurance.\Fifth and finally, protect health care: With the Trump administration and potentially a U.S. Supreme Court putting protections for pre-existing conditions in their cross-hairs, N.H. Senate Democrats will work to shore up New Hampshire's laws to make sure we protect the health care of all Granite Staters, including those with pre-existing conditions.\What was the Republican response to the Granite State Opportunity Plan proposed by the Senate Democratic candidates? The sound of silence. They don't have a plan. In fact, when asked, the Republican majority leader Jeb Bradley just dished out stale talking points about how great he thinks Chris Sununu is. Then, Senate President Chuck Morse wrote a column in this paper (Monitor Opinion, Sept. 26) simply saying everything is rosy under Republican rule. Either Senate Republicans don't have any plans for the next session, or they do have plans and they don't want voters to hear about them. Either way, it is disrespectful to New Hampshire voters. Voters know where Senate Democratic candidates stand, and they know how Democrats will fight for them. It's time for Senate Republican candidates to come out of the shadows and tell us what they stand for and who they are really fighting for.\(Paul Hodes represented the 2nd Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2007 to 2011.

When energy costs drop, we rejoice. Heating fuel, propane and even electricity unit costs have dropped, some significantly, in recent years. With gasoline well under $2 per gallon - driven by public policy initiatives, global politics, advances in technology and plentiful near-term supply - it's human nature to spend what we save in energy costs as part of our daily living.
\
Here's a better idea: Invest these new-found energy savings in home or business energy projects that provide long-term savings.
\
The current drop in energy prices won't last forever; what goes down always seems to come back up. If we invest those savings in energy projects now, we can achieve compounded energy savings down the road. The first excuse often cited for not undertaking energy projects is the lack of upfront money for those projects. Presto, here is the down payment for those projects.
\
There is no better time to invest in clean energy. Your neighbors are installing solar panels and downtown businesses are embracing energy efficiency, and vice-versa. Schools, libraries and town buildings have had their energy use benchmarked and plans are under way to make significant improvements, all of which will save taxpayers and ratepayers.
\
Just about all of these projects still need stable financial incentives to move to action. Tying those incentives to new tools such as leases, power purchase agreements or financing significantly leverages upfront, out-of-pocket costs.
\
Consumers are realizing that these projects are not only good for their wallets, they tap into our Yankee instincts, improve the value of affected and neighboring buildings, and provide many other benefits. Properly insulated buildings are more comfortable, quieter and have better indoor air quality. Who wants to move to a drafty, loud or musty building once you have experienced an efficient one?
\
Buildings that use solar and wood are supporting local businesses and keeping their energy dollars nearby, all while stabilizing and reducing their operational costs. In short, energy-efficiency and smaller scale renewable-energy projects are underway in New Hampshire like at no other time in our history.
\
The state developed an energy strategy in 2015 that provides guidance as to how we can spur our economy while reducing the use of fossil fuels. Scaling up and normalizing energy-efficiency projects means that energy generation needs decline, resulting in fewer and smaller new facilities. With older-generation nuclear and fossil-fuel power plants retiring, this is the ideal time to develop clean, renewable systems and offset demand through energy efficiency. Over time, as more clean-energy and energy storage projects come online, goals that may have seemed a stretch become realistic and attainable.
\
Meeting as much as 50 percent of our energy needs with renewable sources by 2030 and close to all by 2050 is achievable if the market-transformation wheels continue to spin, technology continues to evolve, and public policies provide the certainty that businesses and capital providers need for their private investment. State and utility rebate programs and policies encourage cost-effective, streamlined and site-appropriate energy projects and balance costs, savings and benefits. Net metering, updated building codes, lighting and appliance standards, and goal-oriented policies address different ways that we can move to a more sustainable future. Think back a decade to where cell phones and the internet were, and then look around your neighborhood and think about what it will look like in 15 years.
\
It comes down to expectations and priorities. For years we New Englanders clamored for cheaper energy, and now we are starting to see it. Cheap energy, however, often comes at a cost that is not reflected in a utility bill - costs to public health, the environment, and, yes, the economy. Energy efficiency can be significantly more cost-effective and a good long-term offset to the ""cheap"" energy we are using now. As costs continue to drop for solar and other renewable sources of energy, as policies and programs further encourage the adoption of these technologies and systems, and as we yearn for clean energy solutions and act on those yearnings, we'll soon reach goals we didn't think attainable.
\
How will you - as an individual, at work, and in your community - invest your current savings from low energy prices in a more efficient, cost-effective and cleaner future?

172,"Monitor staff\In the not-too-distant future, all of Concord's municipal energy may be generated by local energy sources, your neighbor's house could be built with rooftop solar in mind, and your public transportation could all be electric.\At least, that's the world the Concord Energy and Environment Committee envisions in its first draft of a strategic plan to have Concord get all of its energy from renewable sources by 2050. The plan was released last week, and it's ambitious: 27 pages covering everything from energy efficiency and electricity, transportation and thermal energy.\The committee's July deadline to have a full plan may seem far away in the middle of winter, but there is plenty of work to be done. The first stakeholder meeting was held last Wednesday, and two more sessions are planned before a final iteration comes before City Council.\Here's some of the big takeaways, as well as feedback from some of the stakeholders:\Energy efficiency\They say the cheapest unit of energy is the one you don't use. That's the guiding principle behind the plans for energy efficiency in the Capital City, even though the nonbinding resolution doesn't specifically call for such measures.\As a whole, Concord consumes 390 million kilowatt hours of energy each year, according to the committee. To bring that figure down, the plan calls for the city and its community to reduce consumption by encouraging weatherization and finding ways to incentivize it (like rebates or community programs).\It also encourages the city to prioritize energy conservation efforts, like switching the streetlights to LED and having all city buildings to be certified under the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program.\That gave Concord City Manager Tom Aspell pause; LEED certification can be expensive, and if the plan was going to demand the city pursue certification, he said at the meeting he couldn't support it.\Instead, he recommended the city's buildings meet LEED standards, but not pursue LEED certification.\Electricity \According to the plan, renewable electricity is one of the more critical aspects of achieving the city's goal for two reasons.\One, it's the most achievable of the three energy sector goals, thanks to falling solar prices. Two, it's the gateway to more renewable transportation and thermal energy sources, because those goals also rely in part on renewable electricity.\It's also the closest deadline associated with the resolution, which calls for all of the city's electricity to be renewable by 2030.\The plan calls for as much renewable electricity to be generated within Concord's borders as possible, which will result in more jobs, tax base and energy security (i.e., the closer a source of energy, the less likely the supply will be interrupted).\To do that would require an extensive amount of steps, primarily focusing on making solar usage more widespread in the city by streamlining the permit process, supporting net metering and community solar projects, and facilitating microgrids – self-sufficient grids with their own storage that can be connected to the grid for backup or to deliver excess power.\The Rev. Michael Leunchtenberger, senior minister for the Unitarian Universalist Church of Concord, supported the idea of making the solar process easier. His church's quest to put solar panels on its property in 2017 highlighted some of the difficulties a person can have when navigating the city's zoning codes.\Transportation\Changing how Concord gets around is another big part of the plan, with a big focus on making the city more accessible to electric vehicles.\The plan calls for facilitating more electric vehicle infrastructure like charging ports through code and incentives; converting the city's vehicle fleet over to clean transportation, including possibly switching all of the Concord Area Transit buses to electric; and supporting ways to make the city more bikeable and walkable.\Larry Haynes, president and CEO of the Grappone Auto group, said he would like to see the conversation also include hybrid vehicles, saying a lot of people are choosing to explore vehicles that use some gas, some electric to cover their daily commutes.\It could be a while before more electric vehicles appear in New Hampshire, he said. The Granite State hasn't signed onto the Zero-Emmission Vehicle (ZEV) program, a coordinated action plan to reduce air pollution by heavily incentivizing battery-electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles, according to the Multi-State ZEV Task Force website. \That means electric vehicles aren't being distributed to the state, Haynes said; the only way for a dealer to get their hands on them is to swap with a dealer in another state.\Thermal energy\A big point about the city's thermal goals: The committee doesn't expect the city to convert its municipal buildings that were forced to switch to natural gas after Concord Steam closed nearly two years ago to renewable resources.\Other than that, there isn't too much on the subject in the plan. The committee recommends exploring biogas recovery projects at the Hall Street wastewater treatment plan, promoting weatherizing and efficiency, and facilitating access to energy audits and replacing old heating systems with renewable sources.\What's next\The next version of the plan is due a week before the next stakeholder meeting, which is scheduled to take place sometime in March.\To see the drafted plan online, visit view.publitas.com/newspapers-of-new-england/cm-draft-outline-for-ceec-strategic-plan/."
173,"For the Monitor \Gov. Chris Sununu recently signed a proclamation recognizing Clean Energy Week, which runs from Sept. 23-27. Unfortunately, when it comes to Sununu signatures more often than not this summer, the governor has used his red pen to veto bipartisan initiatives that would have actually invested in energy efficiency, expanded clean energy opportunities and lowered our high energy costs in the state.\Currently, New Hampshire rates 21st in the country for energy efficiency efforts and last in New England. We must do better – for the sake of our planet and for our wallets.\Expanding renewable energy opportunities in our state is fundamental to curtailing the impact of climate change and curbing our energy costs. That is why it is so deeply disappointing that Gov. Sununu vetoed eight clean energy bills this summer – all of which had passed with bipartisan support out of the Senate and the House. Fortunately, my fellow lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have another opportunity to do the right thing by voting to override those vetoes when the Legislature reconvenes this week.\In the state Senate alone, we have five clean energy vetoes to take up – a package that, if passed by the governor, would have put New Hampshire in a position to lead on renewable energy and climate action.\If passed, Senate Bill 72 would have eliminated a barrier to the growth of the solar energy market used by the big utilities to their benefit. Unfortunately, Gov. Sununu sided with the big utilities at the expense of ratepayers and clean energy when he vetoed this bill.\SB 168, another important energy bill blocked by Gov. Sununu's veto, would have significantly increased investments in our solar industry. Right now, New Hampshire is at a competitive disadvantage because surrounding states are outpacing our renewable energy development. This bill would have raised our target for solar energy, under New Hampshire's Renewable Portfolio Standard, by 2025 to 5.4% compared to the current miniscule 0.7% goal – the equivalent of taking 200,000 cars off the road in reduced emissions. Such an increase would not only have advanced our efforts to combat climate change and protect public health, but it also would significantly advance the opportunity for good jobs in the solar industry – potentially one of the fastest growing industries in the state.\The governor also vetoed SB 205, another important clean energy bill that would return control of energy efficiency programs to the Public Utilities Commission by instituting a small “systems benefit charge” on everyone's electric bills that funds energy efficiency programs available to ratepayers, including programs for low-income households.\SB 275, vetoed by Gov. Sununu, would have provided for the long-range planning vision needed for the state to transition to alternative fuel vehicles, cutting emissions in New Hampshire, where passenger vehicles are the biggest source of emissions, and saving everyone money in the long term. Our state officials, including the governor, should be acting proactively to reduce emissions in the transportation sector while preserving passenger vehicle performance.\Gov. Sununu is so adamantly opposed to clean energy he even vetoed SB 167, a study commission that had the potential to reduce costs for New Hampshire ratepayers.\This week the House will take up three of their own clean energy bills that were vetoed by Gov. Sununu, including a biomass bill to protect New Hampshire jobs and New Hampshire-based renewable energy, and a bill to expand cost-effective public-private partnerships in energy efficiency, including low-income energy efficiency.\However, the most anticipated clean energy related override vote, is expected on HB 365, which would expand net metering in the Granite State.\New Hampshire's electricity consumers, including our municipalities, commercial businesses and other large users want competitive retail options to lower their energy costs and our local property taxes. Unfortunately, current New Hampshire law limits these consumers' ability to become more self-sufficient and energy independent.\HB 365 would break down barriers to renewable energy by increasing the size limit on customer-generators that may participate in net energy metering from 1 megawatt up to, but not including, 5 megawatts. It would increase renewable energy supplies, reduce energy costs and insulate all New Hampshire ratepayers from electric price volatility and higher transmission costs.\All these clean energy bills garnered broad support from the public, New Hampshire businesses and legislators, yet were still vetoed by Gov. Sununu, who relies on his veto pen instead of open dialogue and compromise with lawmakers. And at the same time, he has the gall to pronounce Sept. 23-27 Clean Energy Week in New Hampshire!\It is truly disturbing that Gov. Sununu is holding back New Hampshire from taking charge of its energy future. However, your elected officials still have an opportunity to do the right thing. When legislators reconvene this week to take up Sununu's clean energy vetoes, they will have the opportunity to stand with the overwhelming majority of Granite Staters who want to expand access to renewable energy and lower energy costs, and protect our environment. It is imperative that you urge your state senators and representatives to override Gov. Sununu's vetoes on all these bills. The health of our planet and our children simply cannot wait any longer for us to act.\(Sen. Martha Fuller Clark, a Portsmouth Democrat, serves as chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Rep. Robert Backus, a Manchester Democrat, serves as chair of the House Science, Technology and Energy Committee.)"
174,"Monitor staff \Patricia Simpson said she bought a home on Mark Road in Franklin 40 years ago because it was in a nice neighborhood with a lot of other families nearby.\A Portsmouth company is now looking to install a three-megawatt solar array with nearly 10,000 panels next door – and Simpson is worried about how it will impact her life and her property. She wonders whether it will discourage families from moving to the neighborhood in the future.\“I understand what you're trying to do,” Simpson told developers at a recent planning board meeting, explaining she understands the environmental benefits of solar energy. “But I don't think you'd want it in your neighborhood,” she said, turning back to the board.\Besides the complaints from neighbors, the project involves potential conflicts of interest for several city officials. Still, it has moved swiftly through city government.\Usually, a developer would need to obtain a variance to build an industrial or commercial project in a residential zone, like the low-density residential and single-family residential zoning districts that encompass the 13 acres located near 293 Sanborn St., by Duffy Street and Mark Road. However, Franklin's city attorney is pointing to state law, RSA 672-1.3a which states that renewable energy systems like solar projects cannot be “unreasonably limited” by the use of municipal zoning powers.\Questions of conflict of interest have been raised involving the chairman of the planning board, David Liberatore, and Franklin's mayor, Tony Giunta.\The land for the proposed solar project is split into two parcels, both purchased within the last four months by developer Rob Pearlman, who owns several properties in the city, under different names: General Properties, LLC and Sun Development Group, LLC.\At a Dec. 15 planning board meeting, Liberatore said he was the real estate agent for the land sale of at least one of the parcels – 6.75 acres of land located between 293 Sanborn St. and Mark Road and Duffy Street – and recused himself from the conceptual discussion of the project.\The land was never officially put on the market, even though there were other parties interested in buying the land, according to the city assessing department. It was sold through a private sale for $66,000 on Feb. 15 to General Properties, LLC.\When New England Solar Garden submitted its site plan and attended a public hearing on the plan last Wednesday, Liberatore did not recuse himself.\While chairing the public hearing, Liberatore was asked by a member of the public why he wouldn't recuse himself again.\“I have nothing to do with the project at all anymore,” he said. “The land sold has nothing to do with me.”\Giunta is the director of project development for Nobis Group, the consulting firm doing the engineering work for the project. Nobis Group has also completed engineering work for another General Properties project in Franklin, Mercantile Place, a soon-to-be- three-building business complex purchased in August 2018.\Giunta, meanwhile, did recuse himself at Wednesday's meeting.\“I wear several hats and the most important hat is to promote the city; I'm the city's biggest cheerleader,” Giunta told the Monitor. “When someone asks me about Nobis, I promote Nobis Group–- but if the two ever start to cross, immediately I will recuse myself from any conversation that crosses those ethical boundaries.”\The current solar panel project involves a proposed 20 acres of tree clearing for installation of the 3-foot-by-6-foot panels, which will stand 7 ½ feet apart. Surrounding the array will be a 7-foot-high chain-link fence, a representative from Nobis Group said.\There are 17 Franklin addresses listed as abutters on the site plan review application, and more that have a direct view of the project.\Developers are promising residents a 20-foot buffer of trees to the south of the array and 10 feet to the western property line, but several raised concerns that won't be enough to shield their view. Six spoke at the public hearing Wednesday.\“I'm pretty sure I'll be able to see over that from my second story bedroom window,” said Maureen Farmer, a 42-year resident of Duffy Street. “I don't really want to be looking out at thousands of solar panels every day for the rest of my life.”\Andrew Kellar of New England Solar Garden said the company looked to make the solar project as unobtrusive as possible. He said there won't be any security lighting installed and the project won't make noise.\“Once it's built, you won't even notice it's there,” he said.\The array would be connected to the power grid with the energy sold through a power purchase agreement with Eversource.\Kellar, who works out of Portsmouth, said he has been part of numerous solar projects across the state. He said he got into the field to make a positive impact on the environment and set an example for his three kids.\New Hampshire Solar Garden was the same company that planned to develop an 8.5-megawatt solar project in Franklin three years ago. That project would have been the state's largest solar installation but fell through after a bill that would raise the net metering cap failed in the Legislature.\The Franklin planning board will continue to discuss New England Solar Garden's site plan at their meeting on May 22 at 6 p.m. in city hall.\\(Leah Willingham can be reached at 369-3322, lwillingham@cmonitor.com or on Twitter @LeahMWillingham.)"
175,"Partnership: Groundswell and The Temple of Faith are joining forces to provide clean, affordable energy to Ward 7 and 8 residents.\WASHINGTON Energy equity nonprofit Groundswell and The Temple of Praise, a visionary 15,000+ member, interdenominational church located in the Washington Highlands neighborhood of the District of Columbia, today announced a partnership to develop an equitable community solar array on the church's property that will provide clean, affordable energy for more than 150 households in Washington, D.C., Wards 7 and 8.\""The Temple of Praise, a church that has a long and rich history in the community, is now at the forefront of showing us how a church that is vital to the soul of its community can also offer its neighbors more affordable energy bills, cleaner electricity, community investment, energy equality and a neighborhood profile as a national leader in renewable energy,"" said Pastor Dant'e Overture King, director of community engagement for Groundswell. ""This project is groundbreaking, and it can be replicated across the city and the country to give our communities many of whom have been left out of the clean and affordable energy conversation ownership over their energy future while bringing multi-million dollar investments to the neighborhood.""""Our church has always been a community church. From the day my dad, Bishop Glen A. Staples, was installed as senior pastor, we were on a mission to empower our community and reach out to the many who felt the most looked over and left behind. It's been challenging at times, but we've been very successful,"" said Pastor Walter L. Staples of The Temple of Praise. ""When we received the call from Groundswell and the conversation was about community power, it was a no brainer. We can help people save money on their utility bill while being environmentally friendly. I said let's go.""Through the partnership, Groundswell will work with The Temple of Praise to develop and construct a landmark solar installation that will also serve as a canopy for the church's parking lot. The solar array will be connected to the power grid and thanks to Washington, D.C.'s community solar law any community members who pay their own power bills (including renters and owners) would be able to purchase affordable electricity from the array and reduce their monthly electricity bill. Groundswell projects a minimum savings of 10 percent on electricity costs for low- and moderate-income household subscribers.Community solar is an emerging distributed energy solution that holds the promise of radically expanding clean energy access to the half of America that can't participate in rooftop solar because they don't own their roof, don't have a roof in the right location, or don't have a high enough credit score. Community solar is currently a modest part of America's energy mix with fewer than 150 projects in operation across the United States. Once constructed, The Temple of Praise project would be the largest community solar project in the District and the first in Wards 7 and 8.""Groundswell's mission is building community power, and we are grateful to work together with The Temple of Praise to serve the neighborhoods and the people of DC Ward 7 and 8 with clean energy investment, economic opportunity and electricity cost savings,"" said Michelle Moore, CEO of Groundswell. ""Solar energy is abundant, and its benefits should be available to all.""\About community solar in D.C.'s Wards 7 and 8\Washington, D.C.'s Wards 7 and 8 are located to the Southeast of the Anacostia River. The neighborhoods have one of the highest percentages of renters per capita in the District, and more than half of the rental units are considered unaffordable by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development standards. In addition, the energy usage per residential square foot in the Anacostia neighborhood is the highest in the city, contributing to unaffordable energy bills.The District government is pursuing a number of initiatives aimed at enhancing the economic prospects and housing needs of Ward 7 and 8 residents, including the enhancement of the Housing Production Trust Fund and the implementation of the DC Housing Preservation Strike Force's recommendations.Community solar holds the promise of delivering local investment, jobs, and economic development for the D.C. neighborhoods located Southeast of the river, while delivering household electricity cost savings that can help make staying in the neighborhood more affordable for longtime residents.Community solar allows households to purchase affordable clean energy produced close to home, without installing any new equipment. Using this model, a large solar array is built in a location with good sun exposure and access to the power grid. Those who pay their own power bill including renters and owners can buy subscriptions for a portion of the energy produced by the system, which is credited against their power bill.Deploying community solar projects can lower housing costs and drive community-led economic development. Solar projects provide recurring lease payments to property owners for the use of space that is often not fully utilized for income, including rooftops and parking lots. The District's strong financial and policy incentives related to its sustainability plan, net metering legislation, and renewable portfolio standards have created an environment where long-term stable cash flows could be guaranteed for many of the larger existing property holders in Wards 7 and 8, such as churches, low-income housing providers and other community based organizations. These kinds of ancillary sources of income can help enhance the economic vitality of existing housing and community service organizations so they can remain in the neighborhoods they serve. In addition, electricity cost savings for households that subscribe to community solar projects for electricity can keep the neighborhood affordable for families.Groundswell is a nonprofit organization that builds community power by helping families save money while taking control of their energy future. Groundswell believes that clean energy is a necessity, not a luxury and focuses on economic equity and the energy sector operating community solar, clean energy and efficiency programs throughout the Mid-Atlantic that educate, engage and mobilize economically diverse households and businesses."
176,"Monitor staff \All but two of the Granite State's 13 mayors have agreed to back a letter asking legislators to override Gov. Chris Sununu's vetoes of two energy-related bills.\The letter, drawn up by Mayors Karen Weston of Dover and Tony Giunta of Franklin, assumes unity from the all of the mayors in asking the House and Senate to reverse the governor's position on Senate Bill 365, which would have required utilities to purchase power from New Hampshire's six independent biomass power plants; and Senate Bill 466, which would have expanded net metering – a system that allows smaller power generators to get credits for electricity they send to the grid.\All municipalities stand to lose from the vetoes, the letter argues, because they endangered renewable energy projects across the state and have led three biomass plants to close or plan to shutter operations. Supporters say the bills would have resulted in cheaper energy. Detractors saw them as subsidies that are passed on to consumers, driving up the cost of electricity in the state.\The holdouts so far are Laconia's Ed Engler and Concord's Jim Bouley. Giunta said all other mayors have verbally agreed to sign the letter before the override day scheduled for Sept. 13.\“The goal is to let state representatives and senators know how important this is for municipalities,” Giunta said Tuesday. “Especially the 13 cities.”\In Franklin, the situation has imperiled six solar projects, all of which are located on city land, Giunta said. Without the benefit of SB 446, those projects will remain small and not generate as much revenue for the city, he said.\Engler's all too aware of the risk – a solar company is also looking to build a large solar array on a capped landfill, and he said the veto means the company will have to keep the array at 1 megawatt rather than 4.4 megawatts. The smaller array would mean the city will lose out on about $30,000 a year in lease revenue, he said.\But Engler said he agrees with the governor's reasoning for vetoing the bills: both measures amount to a subsidy that would prop up private businesses at the expense of ratepayers, and that's wrong, he said.\Still, Engler may end up signing the letter if the Laconia City Council gets on board. Councilors discussed the issue Monday night and plan to bring it up again in two weeks.\“If the city council wants to go on the record as supporting the veto override, then I'll sign it, regardless of my personal feelings,” Engler said. “I let them know my feelings would not be hurt if they did.”\Mayor Bouley, who was out of state, said via text that he has received a draft of the letter but has not yet signed on.\“I have had a bunch of questions,” he said.\Concord has made strides in the renewable energy field recently, including a goal to have all of the city's energy come from renewable sources by 2050. The city made some changes to the goal before its passage on July 9; nevertheless, it is still the largest municipality in New Hampshire to have adopted the goal.\If Bouley wants the official endorsement of the council, he would have an opportunity to solicit input three days before the override vote could occur.\In vetoing the bills, Sununu said he was protecting New Hampshire ratepayers from handouts to massive energy companies.\“These bills send our state in exactly the wrong direction,” Sununu said in June. “We need to be taking steps to lower electric rates, not pass legislation that would cause massive increases.”\Supporters say the vetoes have had an immediate chilling effect.\“Impacts of the vetoes are already being felt by the state's $1.4 billion timber industry; projects taken offline, biomass plants shuttered, workers furloughed and an imbalance between energy policy and the state's economic and environmental policies,” it reads. “We must reverse these impacts. These two bills reflect the right balance between forward-thinking energy policy, basic economics and preserving a strong and healthy environment for New Hampshire.”\SB 365 was designed to prop up the six biomass plants, which have struggled to stay competitive as natural gas has lowered wholesale energy prices and eaten away profits. Under the bill, electric distribution utilities would be mandated to seek contracts with the plants and buy energy at 80 percent of the default energy rate.\The idea was that the plants, most of which burn wood products, would get the business they need to stay afloat. The reduced purchase price would help offset the cost to ratepayers by purchasing from biomass sources instead of letting the auction market decide.\Most plants are located in the North Country, and three – Pinetree Power plants in Bethlehem and Tamworth and Bridgewater Power Plant in Ashland – announced shortly after the veto they would have to wind down operations.\But even with the reduced purchase price, supporting the plants carried its own costs. The state Legislative Budget Assistant estimated that the bill would lead to increased costs of $15 million to $20 million a year for Eversource and $2.7 million for Unitil, which the analysis said would be passed on in higher rates for both businesses and households.\The issue is sure to play a part in the upcoming September primaries, which will take place just two days before the vote."
177,"Move forward on renewable energy\New Hampshire's elected officials know it better than anyone: the jobs of the future are in renewable energy. With so many people out of work because of COVID-19, a renewable energy stimulus package could put thousands of Granite Staters back to work.\I appreciate the work that many state senators have done to support bills that expand net metering, increase access to community solar projects and seek more renewable energy options for the state. Pursing renewable energy for New Hampshire will siphon us into the future with cleaner air and water, and put us on the path to preventing more catastrophic effects of the climate crisis.\This is why we cannot afford to waste our time on projects that will expand the use of fossil fuels. Projects like the Granite Bridge pipeline would bring more fracked methane gas into our state, locking us into 40 to 50 more years of using dangerous fuel instead of moving us onto renewable energy sources. The project is not a “short-term fix,” as residents along the proposed route wouldn't get access to the gas for upwards of 10 years. Instead, we should focus our efforts to improve New Hampshire's energy efficiency standards, accelerate the offshore wind project, and expand the access and affordability of solar energy.\If New Hampshire's elected officials truly believe the jobs of tomorrow are in renewables, now is the time to act. Support federal and state stimulus bills for renewable energy, and prevent new fossil fuel infrastructure from destroying our communities.\REBECCA BEAULIEU\Newmarket\Make the new normal  be a better world\The coronavirus pandemic has turned the world upside down. The question before us is what will the new normal be. The president longs for things to be right side up again.\In his idealized world, he is on top. He is universally loved. His authority and control are undisputed. It is an idyllic world where “never is heard a discouraging word and the skies are not cloudy all day.” It is the cowboy's dream of a perfect “home on the range.”\In the president's world, the good guys wear white hats or perhaps red MAGA hats. Critics are silenced. Dissent from the left is outlawed. People of color are marginalized and the media are the “enemy of the people.”\There is a better post pandemic vision of the world. It is the one imagined but not realized by the Founding Fathers. Here, all men and women are created equal.\There is no polarization or hateful political rallies. Every citizen has a voice and a place at the table. There is no voter suppression. Science is respected. The rule of law is honored and obeyed. Quality health care is a human right and a clean environment is protected.\The pandemic has revealed our inequality and our distrust of diversity. May the new normal be a better world of mutual respect and love of neighbor as exemplified by the brave health care workers and first responders who have stepped up in this time of crisis.\FRANK WARMAN\Hopkinton\Open-mindedness on taxation\How will we return to normal and restore ourselves mentally and fiscally after the COVID-19 pandemic? The N.H. Fiscal Policy Institute has been assessing the economic damage done to our state and what it might take to get back to where we were. New Hampshire has a rainy-day fund, but even with federal support it will not nearly cover expanded costs due to unemployment, Medicaid, food assistance, other family and health services, and lost revenue. In fact, New Hampshire is worse off than other states because of low reserves and in the bottom 10 states when examined by Moody's fiscal stress tests.\Our state has long operated under regressive taxation, which means that people with lower incomes pay a greater portion of their income to the state than those better off. Because of COVID-19, the number of residents in financial trouble is increasing and their prospects are worsening. It is time to think about progressive taxation, which is inherently more fair. That may mean an income tax which does not abuse those with less, and does not rely so heavily on property taxes. Can a Republican governor, who has used over 50 vetoes to stop other progressive legislation, become more flexible in light of our state's realities? Now would be the time!\My neighbors and I want to survive and return to normalcy, even if it means our state has to evolve. It is imperative that we embrace bipartisanship and be open to new strategies for funding essential state programs.\ELLEN ANDERSON\New Boston\Everyone should be wearing a mask\On Monday I was appalled to see a picture of a server delivering food to a car window while not wearing a mask or gloves. In the same article, restaurant owners state they are reeling from a lack of business. This is a perfect example of why.\I called the restaurant and was told I was one of several people who had called. When I said they should all be wearing masks, I was told the owner does not require that they wear masks, it is up to the individual employees to decide. Does no one read the paper or watch the news? The CDC says we should all be wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Does no one want this horror to end?\Gov. Chris Sununu should require that we all wear masks, or maybe he hasn't gotten the message. Oh, wait, our governor doesn't even wear a mask himself to set an example. Apparently he doesn't care enough about his family or his constituents to help prevent the spread of the virus. If we don't all smarten up soon people are going to needlessly die and this virus is going to spread forever. It is very simple to wear a mask. We shouldn't have to pay for your carelessness.\LINDA DUNNING\Hopkinton"

Stalled construction on a solar panel installation at a Concord home can begin again, despite multiple challenges from neighbors who don't believe the large array fits the character of their secluded street.
\
The Concord Zoning Board gave Doug and Katrina Magee the okay in June to erect a large solar array in their backyard on Reserve Place. Then, shortly after the metal support beams went up in July, an order from a Merrimack County Superior Court judge brought the construction to a screeching stop.
\
The nearest neighbors, David and Rebecca Biss, had filed both a lawsuit arguing the solar array would violate a long-standing neighborhood covenant. They also filed an appeal to the zoning board, asking for a new hearing, saying the Magees had misrepresented their plans to the city.
\
But by the end of July, the lawsuit sputtered out. On Tuesday, the zoning board denied the request for a rehearing. The Magees are free to begin construction again. The array is allowed to be 70 feet long, 11 feet wide and 13 feet tall.
\
Other homes and properties in Concord are powered by solar, but this was the first time in recent memory the city's zoning board needed to rule on a solar project. The city doesn't have a specific code to govern the placement of such arrays.
\
This case could set a precedent in this quiet neighborhood and in Concord at large.
\
The dispute
\
Reserve Place is a serene and wooded street. The neighborhood is located in a residential zoning district that requires more space between houses than any other in Concord - at least 80 feet. The Magees and the Bisses have been neighbors for about a decade.
\
As the Magees' electric bill rose, the family began to look into solar power. They hired Granite State Solar, based in Boscawen. Based on the Magees' electric usage, they would install 52 panels in the backyard, likely at a cost of more than $50,000. Any extra power generated beyond the usage at their home will return to the grid and be credited with Unitil, a process called net metering.
\
But the array couldn't go on the roof, because the house doesn't face south. Based on the wetlands and trees on other parts of his lot, Doug Magee argued the best place would be on the ground near the Bisses' property line.
\
""I should be allowed to produce green energy, clean energy,"" Magee told the board at the June meeting.
\
The Bisses argued the array was so large because the Magees use more than the average amount of energy, but Chairman Chris Carley said that information didn't fall within the zoning board's purview. They also said tree cover would be minimal in colder months.
\
""In the winter, we will have a full view,"" Rebecca Biss said in an interview. ""I can see a wide open view of that space.""
\
Despite their arguments, the board eventually gave the family permission to build the large array just 5 feet away from the Bisses' property line, much closer than normally allowed. In a unanimous vote, the board stipulated the Magees should plant evergreen trees to block the Bisses' view of the structure.
\
Erik Shifflett, a partner at Granite State Solar, told the board in June that only a few trees would be required to block the view of the array.
\
""The array is perpendicular to the house,"" Shifflett said. ""It's not parallel to the house. The view is the side view of the panels. It's not the length of the array. It's essentially a sideways image.""
\
That statement stuck with the Biss family. Since construction has started, they said they can actually see the length of the array from their home. In her request for a new hearing, Rebecca Biss argued the board should reconsider the Magees' approval because the testimony at the hearing is different from the current construction.
\
The board and the city, however, also review written plans while making their decisions. On those drawings, the array is nearly parallel to the Biss' property line. Zoning Administrator Craig Walker visited the site earlier this week, and he told the board the construction matches the submitted plans.
\
And Carley said the board did know the array would not sit at that sharp 90-degree angle from the Bisses' property.
\
""We realized the way it was angled,"" Carley said. ""It was not going to be perpendicular to (the Bisses') view.""
\
The board always takes neighbors' concerns seriously, Carley said. But here, the board sided with the Magees.
\
""We felt that based on the evidence that we had . . . the impact on the neighbors was going to be less than they felt it was,"" he said. ""We looked at the way the thing was oriented, how far away it was from the house, what was between - nobody felt this was going to have a significant impact on the neighboring property.""
\
The covenant
\
This neighborhood was built in 2003, and the residents of its eight homes all signed a covenant when they moved in. That document states the neighborhood will be ""a peaceful country atmosphere,"" and it sets out rules to that effect.
\
As far as either household can tell, the covenant has never been consulted for a debate like this.
\
""We don't have a homeowners' association,"" Magee said. ""No one's enforced (the covenants).""
\
So the Bisses filed a lawsuit. They claimed, for one, the solar array was too close to their property under the covenant. But like the city's zoning code, that document does not ever mention solar panels specifically. And like the zoning board, the judge sided with the Magees.
\
""It's like nobody's listening,"" Biss said, her voice thick with emotion. ""We've never done anything wrong. We've only spoken the truth.""
\
In zoning hearings and in emails to the Biss family, Magee has offered to create a natural shield of large evergreen trees. He also asked if he could pay for the Bisses to remove about six of their own nearby trees, which he was worried would fall on his property. The Bisses said no.
\
""We are going to be neighbors for a long time and wish we could have a much more amicable resolution to this situation,"" Magee wrote back.
\
That's not a compromise, Biss said in an interview. ""It's amicable to them,"" she said.
\
The next step
\
The Bisses could appeal the zoning board's decision to the Merrimack County Superior Court.
\
""It's just been frustrating,"" Magee said. ""I'm trying to do what's right for me, my family and the environment.""
\
Biss said she is still in shock.""We wanted that atmosphere,"" Biss said. ""I grew up on a farm with complete privacy. My husband grew up in the suburbs of Chicago - he was ready for the privacy. We did pay a premium to have that, and the zoning board just took that away.""
\
The couple had not yet decided Tuesday whether they will challenge the board's decision again.
\
""I'm more angry at the people who are supposed to be protecting the ordinances,"" Biss said. ""They're the ones to blame.""
\
At the June hearing, one zoning board member suggested the city would need to write more specific ordinances for solar panels in the future.
\
""At some point, the code will probably have to look at solar specifically,"" Andrew Winters said. ""But it hasn't. So we have to look at the code as it's written now.""
\
But Carley, the chairman, said the board would probably not have deliberated or decided differently if the Magees had wanted to build a garden shed. So he didn't think an array of solar panels needed special consideration.
\
""It's always tough when a neighbor does not like the outcome of a case, and obviously, we would love to have all the customers be happy and satisfied,"" Carley said in an interview Tuesday. ""But it's not going to be possible. . . . I don't think there's a need for special rules for solar panels.""

He has used these skills during his 31 years in Bow on 11 town committees and as selectman since 2002 – including helping to keep the town budget under inflation from 2015 to 2019 and with the 2020 budget under that of 2019.\I would call that a proven record.

His family. It is the core of his being and the reason for his drive to ensure a safe, productive and enjoyable environment.

One notable result of the current antagonism between Republican Speaker Shawn Jasper and his nemesis, Bill O'Brien, is that Jasper's House Republican majority leadership team - in an attempt to unify their party and assert control over the legislative agenda - is looking for political issues on which they can make common cause with the rump O'Brien caucus. This effort is taking place on a broad range of issues, but nowhere is it more obvious or more alarming than with respect to House Republicans' current efforts to gut two of New Hampshire's signature environmental laws - the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and the Renewable Portfolio Standard.
\
RGGI
\
RGGI, a bipartisan multistate compact organized in 2007-8 by New York's then Republican Gov. George Pataki, has resulted in a 40 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions among nine participating Northeastern states from Maine to Maryland, including New Hampshire. It has also generated $20 million in economic growth in New Hampshire, largely in the form of new clean-energy jobs and energy cost savings, according to detailed studies by the Analysis Group. The most successful cap-and-trade clean air program since the campaign against acid rain, RGGI is seen by experts on both sides of the aisle as a model for market-based federal legislation to slow, if not reverse, the effects of global warming. Our participation in RGGI also means New Hampshire will likely not be required to take costly further measures to comply with the EPA's June 2 Clean Power Plan, which will impose new reductions in CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fueled generating plants.
\
On Jan. 22, five days after NASA and NOAA announced that 2014 was on average the warmest year since official record-keeping began in 1880, the House Science, Technology and Energy Committee held a public hearing on HB 208 in Representatives Hall at the State House in Concord. In its original form, the bill called for outright repeal of New Hampshire's participation in RGGI. Well more than 100 members of the public attended. Dozens spoke in opposition to RGGI repeal. Of the four who spoke in favor of the bill, two were members of the House Republican leadership, one was concerned about communist plots and the fourth was the director of Americans for Prosperity-New Hampshire, funded by the Koch brothers' oil and gas interests. His suggestions for an alternative to RGGI included building a new nuclear plant in New England, or having New Hampshire pull out of ISO-New England, the regional grid operator that keeps New England's lights on.
\
Realizing that the public would simply not tolerate outright repeal of RGGI, House Republican leaders later sponsored a fall-back amendment, which passed ST&E on a straight party-line vote. The bill that will come before the House tomorrow would preserve New Hampshire's participation in RGGI, but eliminate all state energy efficiency programs funded with RGGI revenues from the sale of emission ""allowances"" (each allowance is a permit to emit one ton of CO2), rebating all such funds to ratepayers in order to ""reduce electric rates."" Reducing electric rates would indeed be something to talk about, if HB 208 as amended would do that to any appreciable degree. But it won't.
\
RGGI allowances have recently sold for about $5 per ton of CO2. Current state law (RSA 125-O:23) provides that the first $1 of revenue from the sale of each RGGI allowance received by New Hampshire goes to energy efficiency programs coordinated by the Public Utilities Commission (programs that have been very successful in creating ""green jobs""), and that all such revenues in excess of $1 per allowance are rebated to retail electric ratepayers on a per-kilowatt-hour basis. PUC witnesses have testified that in 2014, RGGI energy efficiency programs funded by that ""first dollar"" totaled $3.487 million (the equivalent of 21 cents on an average residential customer's monthly electric bill of $125 for 650 kilowatt-hour), while the amounts in excess of the first dollar resulted in ratepayer rebates amounting to 83 cents per average monthly residential electric bill. In other words, eliminating the $1 of RGGI-funded energy-efficiency programs would reduce the average New Hampshire residential ratepayer's monthly electric bill by 21 cents - about enough for a stick of chewing gum. Meanwhile, PUC and DES witnesses and other experts testified that RGGI-funded energy efficiency programs (especially those targeted to low-income residents) would in fact be the most effective way to reduce retail electric rates over time, by reducing total demand for electricity in New Hampshire.
\
In the short-to-medium term (within four years), there is only one way to reduce New England retail electric rates significantly, and that is to increase the supply of natural gas delivered to the ""Dracut Hub"" during winter months, when tight supplies of natural gas are dedicated first to home heating requirements, and gas-fired electric generators have to pay much higher wholesale prices for natural gas because pipelines cannot currently provide enough supply.
\
Renewable Portfolio Standard
\
Longer term, what will keep a lid on retail electric prices is a combination of energy efficiency to reduce demand and the development of native renewable energy sources to increase supply. That brings us to the House Republican leadership's shortsighted attempts to gut New Hampshire's Renewable Portfolio Standard law, which requires New Hampshire utilities to obtain 25 percent of the power they sell to ratepayers from renewable energy sources by 2025.
\
Three bills introduced by various Jasper and O'Brien Republicans - HB 143, 234, and 543 - would either weaken or totally repeal New Hampshire's bipartisan efforts to reduce our reliance on out-of-state fossil fuels and encourage development of domestic renewable energy sources. HB 143 would swamp the market for Class 1 ""renewable energy credits"" by allowing large hydropower from Canada (which, unlike small domestic Class 1 sources, needs no public subsidies) to qualify for Class 1 REC's. HB 234 would collapse the current four classes of renewable energy sources qualifying for REC's into a single class. Either would effectively shut down New Hampshire's nascent renewable energy industry. And HB 543 would repeal the RPS statute altogether, effectively signaling that New Hampshire is quite happy to rely on federally subsidized out-of-state fossil fuels for the foreseeable future.
\
These three bills aimed at New Hampshire's RPS programs will be discussed in ST&E today and presumably debated on the House floor during the first week of March.
\
Let's not let RGGI and New Hampshire's Renewable Portfolio Standard become victims of the fractured Republican majority's attempt to score partisan political points based on arguments that fly in the face of overwhelming testimony from both experts and the public.

181,"For the Monitor\As a lifelong Republican and former chairman of the New Hampshire Senate Environmental Committee, I recognize the immediate need for strong policies to protect our natural resources and combat climate change. A cleaner and stronger environment is not only essential for future generations, but it also is key to helping Granite Staters and businesses across our state thrive now. This is not simply a Democratic or Republican issue, and I am proud to stand with leaders from either party who are fully committed to protecting our environment.\That's why in the race to represent New Hampshire in the U.S. Senate, I am eager to support Gov. Maggie Hassan.\Maggie understands the effects of climate change on our economy and our way of life, and throughout her career in public service, she has fought to take action on clean energy priorities.\As state senator, Maggie sponsored the original legislation for our state to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to reduce harmful emissions and energy costs and create jobs here in New Hampshire. And she helped pass the New Hampshire Renewable Portfolio Standard to maintain and grow the renewable energy sector.\As governor, she has built on those efforts, signing bipartisan legislation to update the RPS, investing in energy efficiency, and raising the net metering cap to help the clean energy industry in New Hampshire grow and thrive.\She has also called on members of New Hampshire's congressional delegation to support the Clean Power Plan, she entered New Hampshire in a global contract (Under 2 MOU) with cities, states and provinces to limit the increase in global average temperature, and has worked with our nation's governors to further state collaboration in energy planning and policymaking.\Maggie has made clear that in the Senate, protecting the environment will be a top priority. And in her economic plan, Maggie laid out the priorities she will focus on to build a cleaner, more affordable energy future for our state and our nation.\New Hampshire needs a senator who will always fight for our environment and put our natural resources first.\Maggie understands that protecting our environment is more than just an election year issue. Her support for the environment isn't a political calculation, it's at the core of what she's fought for throughout her time in public service – and it always will be.\This election is a critical test of our nation's priorities, and regardless of political party, we need to think about what kind of future we are leaving for our children. Despite being a registered Republican, I will cast my vote in November not based on party, but rather based on who is the strongest leader on issues that are critical to the future of our nation and our planet.\When it comes to protecting our environment, Maggie Hassan is the clear choice for New Hampshire.\(Rick Russman lives in Kingston.)"

Recently the New Hampshire Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources amended Senate Bill 99, placing a moratorium on new wind electricity generation projects for a period of one year. That's a nice start, but it doesn't go quite far enough. What's needed is a repeal of the New Hampshire Renewable Portfolio Standards mandate. Why? Because ratepayers are being forced to buy extremely expensive electricity when cheaper alternatives are available.
\
The New Hampshire RPS requires electricity providers to purchase a percentage of their electricity supply from four separate classes of politically preferable renewable energy - either directly or in the form of Renewable Energy Credits.
\
If electricity providers aren't able to meet RPS obligations, they are required to make alternative compliance payments. In 2012 the payments were $31.39 per megawatt hour for Class III (biomass) and Class IV (existing small hydro); $64.02 for Class I (mostly wind and biomass) and $168.13 for Class II (solar). These payments are made in addition to what electricity providers have to pay for the energy they use to provide us with electricity. Who do you think pays for these additional expenses? We, the ratepayers.
\
Based on data provided by the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission, New Hampshire electricity providers paid $47 million in Renewable Energy Credits and alternative compliance payments from 2008 to 2010 and an additional $19 million in payments in 2011. This doesn't include the additional costs of purchasing or producing electricity from less efficient generating sources.
\
The U.S. Energy Information Association estimates that the 2018 levelized costs of natural gas will be $67 per MWh. The same report estimates onshore/offshore wind will be $86/$221 per MWh, biomass at $111 and photovoltaic/thermal solar at $144.3/$261.5 per MWh. This data doesn't account for the reduced capacity value of wind and solar, which cannot be dispatched upon demand, making them less reliable and less valuable sources of electricity.
\
These numbers will come into play as the Rewewable Portfolio Standards requirements increase from 12 percent in 2013 to 25 percent in 2025. New Hampshire ratepayers consumed nearly 11 million MWh in 2012. If supply is shifted just 10 percent from natural gas to onshore wind (which is the cheapest renewable alternative), it will cost New Hampshire ratepayers an additional $21 million in electricity charges; biomass would increase rates by $48 million and solar up to $213 million. It's clear that Renewable Portfolio Standards policies are detrimental to electricity rates.
\
But what about the environment? This is certainly the case where good intentions have driven half-baked policy. RPS rules have a negligible impact on global carbon-dioxide emissions, especially when China, India and other developing nations are using fossil fuels at steadily increasing rates. More importantly, solar and wind aren't exempt from negatively impacting the environment. The manufacturing of solar panels produces millions of pounds of hazardous waste containing lead and cadmium, a known carcinogen. The waste is then transported via truck or rail to dumps that are hundreds and often thousands of miles away - not exactly the greenest way to produce green energy. Ironically, none of this is taken into account when discussing the calculus of solar's environmental footprint. Windmills currently sit on over 9,000 square miles of our landscape - roughly the size of New Hampshire, and more than 14,000 abandoned windmills are littered throughout the country. The environmental benefits touted by proponents are mostly outweighed by the more serious impacts they don't want to discuss.
\
What do ratepayers get for the billions in subsidies, loan guarantees, carve-outs, mandates, millions of pounds of toxic waste, obstructed views and dead birds? Not much. The combined electricity provided by all wind and solar power in New England over the course of a year is generated by our other traditional sources of electricity in less than five days.
\
Despite meager contributions to the county's electricity grid by ""clean"" generators like solar and wind, air quality has improved dramatically. According to the EPA, between 1980 and 2011, gross domestic product increased 128 percent, vehicle miles traveled increased 94 percent, energy consumption increased 26 percent, and U.S. population grew by 37 percent. During the same time period, total emissions of the six principal air pollutants dropped by 63 percent.
\
In a nutshell, ratepayers receive no real benefits from Renewable Portfolio Standards while paying a lot more for electricity. Meanwhile, our legislators and their bureaucrats continue to obfuscate the costs to ratepayers through RPS mandates. Residents of New England should stand up and fight these attempts to pull the wool over the ratepayers' eyes in the name of green energy. It is time to repeal Renewable Portfolio Standards and free ratepayers from the whims of the political class.

183,"Wind energy would power the equivalent of about 1 in 4 New Hampshire households if companies proceed with plans to build five proposed wind farms over the next several years to join three others already in service.\Opponents, however, say the higher costs, government subsidies and impact on the landscape aren't worth the price for renewable energy.\The state's third wind farm, a $120 million project in Groton featuring 48 turbines, became operational Dec. 28, joining wind farms in Lempster and the Dixville Notch area.\Companies are ""looking at New Hampshire's wind resource and drawing up some of these proposals,"" said Timothy Drew, a staffer on the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee, whose approval is needed before wind projects get developed.\At least two more projects are expected to receive key decisions from the Site Evaluation Committee next month.\The committee will start its deliberations on the Antrim wind farm on Feb. 5 at the Public Utilities Commission office in Concord. The deliberations will precede a decision on whether to green light the construction. An appeal would delay the project.\For a proposed wind farm in New Ipswich and Temple, Timbertop Wind I LLC wants the committee to take over jurisdiction to streamline the process. A decision on that also is expected in February, Drew said.\Timbertop, a wholly owned subsidiary of an affiliate of Pioneer Green Energy, is asking the committee to take over jurisdiction because New Ipswich adopted a 2010 ordinance for wind farms and passed a stricter one in 2012 and because the two towns call for different standards for such projects.\""If you're spending millions of dollars as we have and the standards are changing midway through the process, that's a very difficult thing for a developer to spend money on if the standards continue to change,"" said Adam Cohen, founder and vice president of the Texas-based company.\Ed Dekker, a member of the New Ipswich Planning Board, told the New Hampshire Union Leader last week that the company's move is intended to thwart the will of the people who voted overwhelmingly to pass tight restrictions on wind farms in their communities.\As for why companies are eyeing New Hampshire, Cohen said he thinks it is ""because New Hampshire has set up a process to approve projects"" based on their merits.\The eight wind projects, if built, are predicted to generate about 361 megawatts of electricity.\That translates to enough to power more than 120,000 New Hampshire households, according to Tom Frantz, director of the electric division of the Public Utilities Commission, which regulates power companies.\He said his calculations factored in the fact that wind farms produce energy about 30 percent of the time.\But not everyone is ready to embrace wind energy.\Rep. Harold ""Skip"" Reilly, R-Grafton, has proposed legislation calling for a moratorium on all wind power construction until the state updates its energy plan.\""First of all, are we getting any benefit out of this power? It's all going into the grid and it's not being used by us,"" Reilly said. ""It's not reducing our electric rates.""\Hundreds of residents at various meetings have expressed opposition to the wind turbines, he said.\""They're ruining the aesthetics of the area here with these wind mills. The only thing they're benefiting is some foreign company to come in here"" and hurt the views, Reilly said. ""It's not giving New Hampshire anything but a headache.""\According to a report released last month by the Environment New Hampshire Research & Policy Center, a non-profit environmental group in Concord, New Hampshire could save 23 million gallons of water and avoid the vehicle pollution equivalent of 12,000 cars annually with wind energy under construction by displacing energy generated from plants using fossil fuels.\But these trade-offs come with a cost.\The federal government offers a 2.2 cent-per-kilowatt-hour tax credit for operating wind farms.\New Hampshire law -- known as the Renewable Portfolio Standard law -- also requires power companies to generate or buy a certain percentage of power from renewable energy sources or purchase renewable energy certificates from suppliers through the New England Power Pool generation information system. For 2013, that percentage totals 12 percent.\""With the exception of energy from the (proposed) Northern Pass, which is priced at market and requires no customer subsidies, all new energy sources, including wind, are above market, especially now, due to the historic low natural gas prices,"" said Michael Skelton, spokesman for Public Service of New Hampshire, the state's largest electric company\""We are interested in purchasing any type of renewable energy at market prices. But the reality is renewables cannot be built based solely on market prices. They need subsidies, federal incentives like tax credits, and long-term power purchase agreements in order to be economic,"" Skelton wrote. ""As a regulated utility charged with being a low-cost provider, PSNH cannot buy power from above market sources without state-mandated policies like the NH RPS law and the approval of regulators. Our purchase from the Lempster project, for example, allows us to fulfill a portion of the NH RPS law.""\PSNH purchases 90 percent of Lempster's wind power. The Northern Pass project, which has yet to announce a new route for proposed transmission lines, is a joint effort by PSNH's parent company, Northern Utilities, as well as Hydro-Quebec and NSTAR.\""The drawback for wind is its reliability and intermittent nature, which is a further reason PSNH supports biomass and hydroelectric sources, which are highly reliable,"" Skelton said. ""Base load energy sources, like Northern Pass for example, are necessary because intermittent energy sources are not always available.\""All New England states have renewable energy policies in place,"" Skelton said. ""The recent uptick in new wind projects seems to indicate that developers are responding to demand driven by other state's policies.""\Wind supporter Jim Rubens, a former state senator and a member of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the state has ""good wind resource.""\As for the government's financial help, Rubens said, fracking and some other fossil fuel industries also receive subsidies.""You drive new energy sources down the cost curve faster as a result of these subsidies and taxpayer-financed R & D,"" Rubens said.\Congress renewed the federal tax credit for 2013.\Iberdrola Renewables, a Spanish company, has plants operating in Lempster and Groton, with a third, the Wild Meadows project, proposed for the Alexandria-Danbury area. The plants that are operating now are eligible for the tax credit while the Wild Meadows project, if approved, isn't projected to generate power until 2015, according to project developer Ed Cherian.\Cherian said Lempster, which became operational in 2008, ""certainly met all of our expectations.""\The Lempster wind farm has a 15-year deal to sells its power to PSNH and the NH Electric Co-op. Lempster's wind farm generates an operating profit, but it hasn't paid back its capital costs yet, Cherian said.\Its Groton plant has a 10-year power pact with NSTAR, PSNH's parent company.\Cherian said the energy market is complex, but said wind costs more than power from natural gas.\Cherian said ""it's hard to speculate what the market for renewable energy"" would be without the state requirements.\New Hampshire is ""an expensive state to work in,"" he said.\The permitting process is ""very comprehensive; its very expensive. It's many, many months of hearings"" and requirements, Cherian said.\""It's probably scared off other investors because of the amount of cost and the amount of uncertainty in trying to make an investment in the wind farm,"" Cherian said.\Cherian also cited wind energy's favorable attributes.\""We're not using water. We're not using any combustion. There's no global warming impact. We're not extracting fossil fuels. These are all hidden costs in other types of electric generation,"" he said.\Companies conduct tests on possible sites to see what turbine configuration is needed.\""Without diving into the physics of it, a taller tower and a larger rotor both generally help increase the amount of energy each individual turbine can produce,"" Paul Copelman, Iberdrola's communications manager, said in an email. ""That's not to say that we're necessarily seeking the tallest towers and longest blades at any proposed site. We have to evaluate specific site conditions, the likely behavior of the wind, as well as the cost of the machines themselves.""\Lempster's project, for instance, called for a tower height of 256 feet, or 396 feet if you count to the tip of the turbine blades.\But not everybody is a convert.\The Schaefer family from Antrim's Salmon Brook Road, who live on property adjoining the proposed Antrim wind farm, wrote to the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee to oppose the project.\""To allow a nonresident, for-profit group to forever scar this area we have to live in daily and planned to retire in is nothing short of taking our constitutional rights from us,"" the letter said.\mcousineau@unionleader.com\[Caption]"
184,"RGGI: NH is one of nine states to adopt the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, intended to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\CONCORD Supporters and opponents promoted their favorite studies and talking points either to defend or to move to repeal the state's two landmark renewable energy programs.\The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) were both on the firing line as a House committee took testimony on twin bills to repeal each one during public hearings Tuesday in Representatives Hall.New Hampshire is one of nine states that adopted RGGI, intended to control or to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by making polluters buy credits as a penalty for exceeding emission limits.RGGI backers produced an Abt Associates report from last month that estimated the state avoided $100 million in higher health care costs by reducing pollution.""Repealing RGGI would be a mistake for New Hampshire in terms of our economy, our environment and our public health,"" said Michelle McCarthy with Environment New Hampshire.Evan Oxenham, co-chairman of the Plainfield Energy Committee, said since RGGI's inception in 2008, prices have gone down in these states 3.4 percent while electricity costs nationally have gone up 7.2 percent.But Gregory Moore, state director of Americans for Prosperity, said New Hampshire's third-highest residential and fourth-highest commercial and industrial bills for power are leading to companies looking elsewhere to move or expand.Over the past year, electricity costs here went up 6 percent, Moore said.""This is not rocket science, and companies like Sig Sauer are doing the math and realizing it's cheaper to move jobs out of New Hampshire to cheaper-power states,"" Moore said.In December, Sig Sauer announced it was expanding in Arkansas, and New Hampshire high electric rates was a motivating factor.The first one cent per kilowatt hour collected from ratepayers goes to energy efficiency projects.Moore urged lawmakers rather than repeal RGGI to just require that all the money collected be rebated to customers. This would save homeowners $1.3 million annually while commercial and industrial customers would get a $2 million benefit.Catherine Corkery, chapter director of NH Sierra Club, said the program should be made better, not eliminated.""The politically motivated repeal bills are putting the program at risk every year, making it unstable and difficult for users to rely (on) repeated repeal threats exhaust resources and delay helping people,"" Corkery said.New Hampshire's RPS sets annual targets for electricity providers. They meet targets by earning renewable energy certificates (RECs) for selling renewable power to retail customers. They may also buy RECs from other providers to comply.Critics maintain that green energy is expensive and that New Hampshire encourages utilities to sell their certificates in other states because those out-of-state sales are more valuable.Program supporters maintain the RPS is a pivotal incentive for the wood-fired power industry in the North Country that could be put at risk of survival if repealed.\klandrigan@unionleader.com\Credit: By KEVIN LANDRIGAN New Hampshire Union Leader"
185,"EVERYONE I KNOW is tired of working harder while keeping less of what they earn. That's why the recent decision by the state Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to implement an energy efficiency resource standard (EERS) is so distressing. By adding to our electric bill, they are nickel-ing and dime-ing us to death.The Union Leader editorial, ""False Promises: Efficiency won't cut energy use,"" perfectly described what economists call the ""rebound"" effect. When energy efficiency lowers the cost of energy, consumers use more of it, not less. The correlation between gasoline prices and large vehicle sales demonstrates this effect.The PUC decision increasing our monthly electric bill by implementing an EERS was a bad one on many other levels, beyond not lowering energy consumption.First, an EERS contributes to already high electric rates. The PUC's order authorizing the EERS acknowledges that energy prices will go up in the short term. Electricity prices in New Hampshire already suffer from the ""two cents here, three cents there"" problem of mandated charges for the regional greenhouse gas initiative (RGGI), the renewable portfolio standard (RPS), the systems benefits charge, and net metering subsidies, and now the EERS. Together, these mandates add dollars, not cents, to a monthly electric bill. Businesses and organizations such as the Business and Industry Association have complained for several years that this upward price curve for electricity hurts our state's economic competitiveness and stunts job growth. Why would the PUC want to contribute to that problem?Second, an EERS is grossly inefficient. During a presentation to the House Electricity Oversight committee in 2015, a spokesman for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) stated that an EERS would need ""to spend $3 to save $1."" Somebody will have to pay for that inefficiency. The more efficient methods for ensuring energy efficiency in the built environment would involve beefing up building codes, and performing outreach and education to consumers about its benefits.Finally, an EERS is unfair to our poorest citizens. Adding a few cents every month to an electric bill might not hurt many ratepayers, but those who live on fixed incomes or live paycheck-to-paycheck may not agree. Taking a few cents every month from every ratepayer and then redistributing that money to selected individuals who ask for it is socialism. Some can call socializing a preferred-outcome a benefit, but it will be an unfair burden to others.Individual ratepayers should make energy efficiency decisions based on their needs and means. Taking that decision away from ratepayers diminishes everyone's freedom of choice.The PUC should stick to regulating utilities and stop trying to fix what may not be broken..\Rep.

186,"
We're likely to hear a lot more in the near future about the economic peril presented by the Clean Power Plan. Much of it will be nonsense.
\
Tackling climate change has been an economic driver for businesses and investors throughout New England. Earlier in August, the Environmental Protection Agency released the final version of the Clean Power Plan, a groundbreaking approach to limit carbon pollution from existing power plants - the single largest source of greenhouse gas pollution in the United States. Power plants account for 40 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.
\
The Clean Power Plan provides an opportunity for New Hampshire businesses and investors to continue to innovate and build a clean energy economy that creates jobs and economic growth.
\
As members of the investment community, we see the trend toward a clean economy as an investment opportunity. That is why Pax World Management LLC has joined nearly 50 investors managing $800 billion in assets in supporting the creation of these proposed regulations and calling on states like New Hampshire to continue to work with the EPA to reduce carbon emissions.
\
The Clean Power Plan is the first national comprehensive effort to reduce carbon pollution, the leading cause of climate change. By tackling climate change, we are addressing a major risk to the economy and to the investments of individuals and institutions around the country. Increased frequency of severe storms, sea level rise, floods and warmer temperatures are just some of the changes that will affect all aspects of the supply chain. Moreover, we are avoiding the cost of inaction, which will likely be in the trillions of dollars by the end of the century in a business-as-usual scenario.
\
The Clean Power Plan is not just about reducing risks. It is also about creating economic opportunities. The proposed carbon pollution standards will help states scale up solutions we already know work to lower emissions, and that helps the economy and creates jobs. Already, there are twice as many workers in solar power as there are coal miners.
\
Each state will tailor its plan to the policies, industries and practices unique to it. New Hampshire is already on target to tackle climate change and invest in renewable energy. In 2007, the state passed the Renewable Portfolio Standard, and in 2005 New Hampshire joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the first market-based regulatory program in the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
\
RGGI and the RPS have helped to create jobs, spur innovation and attract investments. With the increased development of solar, wind and biomass energy, we are on the path toward reaching the goal of 24.8 percent of all energy produced from renewable sources by 2025.
\
New Hampshire businesses like Stonyfield, Timberland, SustainX and Worthen Industries are addressing climate change, while increasing revenues. And by the way, while there are many things that make New Hampshire unique, that's not one of them. The Carbon Disclosure project reports that an index of companies considered leaders in addressing climate risks and opportunities outperformed the Bloomberg World Index between 2010 and 2014. These businesses show investors and policymakers that we can grow the economy and reduce emissions. The Clean Power Plan will provide additional certainty for companies and investors and offer clear market signals that the United States is committed to lowering emissions.
\
Thankfully, the Clean Power Plan recognizes all of the successes states, businesses and households around the country have already achieved in reducing carbon emissions. The EPA has crafted a flexible means for states to reduce emissions from power plants, including through existing energy efficiency and renewable energy measures. The significant carbon emission reductions that have already taken place in New Hampshire and the other states that are part of the RGGI program will form the basis for meeting the additional carbon reduction targets moving forward.
\
The Clean Power Plan provides an opportunity for New Hampshire to control its own energy destiny while meeting the challenge of climate change by developing an innovative plan to maximize carbon emissions reductions through a range of clean energy solutions. The investments we make in our future will create jobs and investment opportunities, while protecting human health and the environment.

187,".Keeping up with the Joneses: Experimental program offering 25,000 customers a closer analysis of their energy use.\Did you ever wonder if you're using more electricity than your neighbor in a similar home, and if so, what you can do about it?\Public Service of New Hampshire is pilot-testing a new program designed to answer that question and many others related to your energy consumption.\About 10,000 of the 25,000 households chosen randomly throughout the state to participate in the initiative have already received their first Home Energy Report, according to PSNH spokesman Mike Skelton. The remaining 15,000 reports will go out over the next five weeks, and will continue monthly at least for the next year.\After a one-year trial period, during which time various data points and formats will be field tested, the utility will recommend to the Public Utilities Commission whether the program should be expanded to all 400,000 PSNH customers in the state.\The utility is paying a vendor, Opower, to support the Web-based platform for the program, using revenue from the ""System Benefit Charge"" on electric bills, currently set at 0.33 cents per kwh. Any expansion of the program could require an increase in the ""System Benefit Charge,"" which would have to be approved by the Public Utilities Commission.\Opower describes itself as a privately held software company that partners with utility providers around the world to promote energy efficiency.\""Opower has a way to ensure that the sampling is useful in that it's apples-to-apples comparisons among customers,"" Skelton said. The database compares a customer's electricity usage with 100 similar homes in the neighborhood, based on similar home size (square footage), home type and heating source. Opower can't account for variations in the number of occupants in a household.\Customers will also get to see how their energy use changes over time, will get personalized energy efficiency tips and access to online tools to save even more.\""We're offering the report to encourage customers to save energy,"" Skelton said.\Why would a company that makes money by selling electricity want consumers to use less of it?\""Like any business, we want customers to use the product we sell responsibly and efficiently,"" Skelton said, ""and as everyone is aware, this winter we've had some particularly serious price spikes and volatility in the electricity market. If customers are able to use electricity more efficiently, that's less energy we need to buy during these volatile markets, which will save all customers money.""\Customers in the program will see each month how their electricity consumption compares to all neighbors in their group, and to the most energy-efficient neighbors. Efficient neighbors are defined as the 20 homes in the sample of 100 with the lowest consumption.\Consumers will get messages like, ""You used 1 percent less electricity than your most efficient neighbors,"" or ""You used 22 percent more electricity than your efficient neighbors. This costs you about $122 extra per year.""\Personalized tips to save energy will be available at psnh.com/savings for customers in the program.\""We only use your information to provide useful insights about your energy use,"" according to the program FAQ. ""Your information is compiled anonymously and not shared with any of your neighbors. Only you can see your personal data.""\PSNH forecasts a budget for energy efficiency programs annually; this program was selected and budgeted for 2014 with PUC approval.\dsolomon@unionleader.com"
188,"
The high cost of electricity resulting from dramatic increases in oil and natural gas prices has made energy a top concern for New Hampshire businesses. This is especially true for manufacturers, hospitals, ski resorts, office campuses, lodging establishments and many other large energy consumers.
\
The Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire supports the intent of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. We do, however, have a number of concerns with House Bill 1434 - the bill to implement New Hampshire's participation in RGGI - that must be addressed to protect ratepayers and New Hampshire's economy.
\
HB 1434 will put revenue the state receives from the auction of RGGI allowances into the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which will support energy efficiency programs. If the auction price becomes too high, consumers will receive rebates to offset the purchase of allowances. The BIA believes this rebate mechanism is essential, as it will help protect ratepayers should the auction price of allowances go higher than expected. Unfortunately, the price per CO2 allowance in the House-passed version of the bill must exceed $12 before ratepayers receive any rebates. We believe this threshold is far too high.
\
The Department of Environmental Services has estimated New Hampshire will receive revenue from more than 10 million allowances in the first year of RGGI. If New Hampshire's affected sources purchase the allowances for $12, then electricity rates in the state would increase by about $120 million in one year. All consumers will shoulder this price increase. And they will shoulder it during a weak economy, perhaps during a recession.
\
UNH professor Ross Gittell performed an economic analysis of RGGI several months ago. His analysis states that over time New Hampshire will see lower electricity rates through investments in energy efficiency.
\
The BIA does not question this assumption, although it is important to remember that according to the study, it will take at least six years before the savings from these investments offset the net costs of RGGI. Even so, we support and acknowledge the benefits of energy efficiency.
\
However, is the state positioned to spend up to $120 million on energy efficiency programs within the first year of RGGI? Initiatives that improve energy efficiency, increase conservation and implement demand-response programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions require rule making and a realistic ramp-up period. The Public Utilities Commission needed four years to complete rule making and the administrative infrastructure necessary to implement the system benefit charge. While the PUC is working to allocate RGGI auction proceeds in the best manner possible, nonlapsing revenue will continue to accrue and all ratepayers will continue to pay higher electricity rates.
\
$2 threshold
\
The BIA believes the rebate threshold should be set at $2, the amount for which Gittell's study assumes allowances will sell during the auction's first year. A $2 allowance auction price will raise $20 million a year, nearly doubling what the state now spends on energy efficiency through the system benefit charge.
\
A $2 rebate threshold provides some hedge against price uncertainty created by the secondary market where no rebates will be available to New Hampshire ratepayers. A $2 rebate threshold will give the PUC time to implement proper rules and administrative infrastructure necessary to deploy effectively additional energy efficiency dollars. And a $2 rebate threshold will also reduce the temptation by future legislatures to divert the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for other purposes.
\
Another concern is that the RGGI auction is open to anyone. This means speculators may purchase a significant amount of allowances to take them off the market and sell them later as prices spike due to allowance shortages.
\
Allowances sold in this secondary market provide no benefit to the state and no rebate to ratepayers.
\
New Hampshire prides itself on being named the nation's ""most livable state."" Businesses grow, expand and sometimes relocate here due to our competitive business climate and exceptional workforce. New Hampshire, however, has some of the highest electricity rates in the country. Many businesses struggle to make payroll.
\
Without addressing the shortcomings in HB 1434, we fear RGGI may well achieve its CO2 reductions because New Hampshire companies will quietly move or expand operations elsewhere in the country or world. Obviously, this outcome would not help the environment, the thousands of New Hampshire men and women these companies employ, or New Hampshire's economy.
\
The BIA supports the intent of RGGI. However, HB 1434 as drafted does not strike the right balance between protecting the environment and protecting New Hampshire's energy consumers and our economy.

189,"MANCHESTER Thousands of tons of buried trash on the outskirts of the city could, if all goes according to plan, give rise to the state's largest solar installation.\City officials are working with a contractor to obtain financing and approvals for the solar farm. It would be built over the 93-acre landfill between Dunbarton Road and Interstate 293.\Earlier this month, the aldermen's Special Committee on Energy Contracts approved a memorandum of understanding with the contractor, American Capital Energy, a company that has built and managed large-scale solar arrays in Massachusetts and other states.\The landfill could generate 2-3 megawatts, five to six times more power than the largest existing solar installation in the state, at the Manchester-Boston Regional Airport.\Company and city officials said the plan is preliminary and will depend in large part on whether they win a $2.3 million grant they're seeking from the state.\The money would come from Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) funds overseen by the Public Utilities Commission.\In 2010, the city worked with PSNH on a smaller-scale plan to build a solar farm at the landfill.\City Facilities Manager Kevin O'Maley said the effort to secure state funding at the time was complicated because of controversy in Concord over RGGI.\""It really didn't work because of the politics of it,"" he said.\O'Maley said he hoped the solar project stood a better chance of gaining support this time around.\He noted that all utility customers pay a system benefit charge. ""We're paying into it, so we may as well be getting a benefit out of it,"" he said.\So will a solar farm generate the same kind of ire that wind farms have in New Hampshire?\City and company officials insisted that's unlikely.\The installation will be scarcely visible from I-293 and Dunbarton Road, O'Maley said, because the dump is already about 30 feet above grade; the panels would be about 10 feet over the dump.\Nor will the panels create glare for drivers, according to William Fitzpatrick, the director of business development for American Capital Energy.\""It will not affect drivers,"" he said, adding that it is a misconception that photovoltaic panels cause glare. ""They absorb the light.""\The solar farm would only be clearly visible, O'Maley said, from higher hills and from aircraft.\O'Maley said that assessing visual impacts would likely be part of the state's site evaluation process, if it gets to that stage.\Solar arrays are fixtures at former town dumps in many communities on the Cape in Massachusetts, thanks in large part to American Capital Energy, which has built many of them.\Fitzpatrick said building such facilities was more economically viable in Massachusetts because the state requires utilities to purchase a certain portion of their energy from alternative, non-carbon based sources.\O'Maley said it would take nine months to a year to build the solar farm, and that getting the prior approvals and financing would probably take longer.\He said winning the state grant was important, but he added that the team is looking at other options for financing.\""Our goal is to take the leadership position statewide for the development of photovoltaic energy,"" he said.\tsiefer@unionleader.com"
190,".10-state initiative: Energy efficiency at heart of program.\CONCORD -- A proposal to reform rather than repeal the state's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative program found general support Thursday at a public hearing.\The proposal from Sen. Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, would provide consumer rebates, direct money to existing energy-efficiency programs run by utilities, increase oversight and transparency, and allow the state to withdraw if a large New England electric user such as Massachusetts or Connecticut leaves the program.\While the amendment had general support, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee was urged to retain projects that help businesses under the program and to use RGGI money to make public buildings more energy efficient so all taxpayers benefit.\But those who want the program repealed called it a wealth transfer plan based on bad science.\Rep. Timothy Twombly, R-Nashua, said ""RGGI is a wealth redistribution project taking wealth from consumers and giving it to organizations favored by one board.""\Others said the program is bureaucratic, wasteful and hinders real energy conservation.\Bradley told the Senate committee, while there is support in the Senate for House Bill 519, which would repeal RGGI, there is not enough to override a promised veto by Gov. John Lynch.\""If repeal is unlikely, then reform is absolutely necessary,"" Bradley said. ""My amendment will overhaul RGGI to ensure that the program's primary focus is on reducing the cost of energy for New Hampshire citizens and funding only proven energy-efficiency initiatives.""\Lynch sent the committee a letter opposing repeal. ""Our efforts to this point are projected to save our citizens and businesses more than $60 million in energy costs over the next 20 years,"" he wrote. ""Withdrawing from RGGI would be a blow to our economy and our state's effort to become more energy efficient and energy independent, and I applaud the work that you are doing to move the program forward in a form that protects the interest of our citizens.""\Under RGGI -- a 10-state initiative -- power plant owners take part in an auction to purchase carbon dioxide emissions credits. States are allocated proceeds of the auctions on a pro-rated basis.\As demand for electricity slowed in a poor economy, auction prices have fallen to $1.86 per unit from a high three years ago of more than $3.\Under Bradley's proposal, electric utility customers would receive rebates from auction proceeds over $1 per credit, although several people testifying said the threshold needs to be increased.\And others wondered if utilities would spend more providing customers rebates than the rebates themselves. Public Utility Commissioner Clifton Below suggests his agency be given flexibility to work with utilities so costs can be kept to a minimum.\The bill would continue the state's contracts with companies that have obtained grants for energy-efficiency projects and would do away with the Energy Efficiency and Sustainable Energy Board.\The board oversees grant awards for energy-efficiency projects and other programs allowed under RGGI. Bradley's proposal would direct the auction proceeds to the ""core energy-efficiency programs"" currently funded through the system benefit charge on all electrical bills.\The core programs are run by the four state utilities, Public Service of New Hampshire, the NH Electric Cooperative, Unitil and National Grid.\Bradley said the core programs provided the greatest energy savings, while grants were awarded to some ""extraneous uses"" not consistent with the program's intent.\Several people objected saying the funds provided seed money for larger projects. Ken Colburn of Stoneyfield Farm said a grant helped the company make energy improvements in its Londonderry plant. Although it was a small fraction of the overall cost, it did help Stoneyfield compete with other projects within its parent company. ""The grant sweetens the pot,"" he said.\Others said the energy-efficiency board is a great public-private partnership that successfully distributed money generated by the auctions to get the state program up and running.\Richard Minard of the NH Community Loan Fund urged the committee continue the grant program in its current form, particularly for projects that assist low-income residents. He said projects directed at tenant-owned mobile home parks have proved very successful in helping to reduce energy costs for those hit the hardest when prices go up.\Credit: By GARRY RAYNO New Hampshire Union Leader"
