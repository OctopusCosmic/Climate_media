0,"YELLOW SPRINGS -- This village could become home to the largest solar power array in Southwest Ohio in 2012 as part of a $65 million project to put new solar power in smaller Ohio villages and cities. \Mike Dickman, vice president of SolarVision of Westerville near Columbus, said he's close to a financing deal for the ambitious project. He'd like to break ground later this year, he said. \Aside from federal tax credits that will be part of the project, the financing now in its last phases is from private sources, Dickman said. \In Yellow Springs, a 2.5 megawatt array is planned for part of 44 acres of farmland owned by the village that's northwest of town off King Street, said Mark Cundiff, village manager. \Yellow Springs signed a purchase agreement for all the electricity and plans to use it during periods of high demand to lower costs during ""peak"" periods, Cundiff said. \A megawatt (MW) of power is equivalent to one million watts. Renewable energy, because it relies on natural factors, does not produce a consistent power stream. For example, the 1.1 MW Dayton Power & Light solar array in Washington Twp. produces enough electricity to power 150 average homes in a year, but up to 750 on bright days. \Between the solar array and new Ohio River hydroelectric projects being built now, Yellow Springs intends to draw more than 50 percent of its power needs from renewable sources in 2013, Cundiff said. \Yellow Springs owns its electric power distribution system. \The village's aggressive renewable goal is being helped by American Municipal Power Inc. or AMP, which is building new hydro projects on the Ohio River at existing dams. \AMP said that the projects will add 300 megawatts of capacity. AMP has called the projects ""the largest development of new run-of-the-river hydroelectric generation in the country."" \Dickman said other sites planned for solar arrays include Celina, Wapakoneta, Greenfield, Carey, Wellington, Clyde and Newark. The projects should generate 20 megawatts of electricity, more than any single solar installation operating in Ohio. \Dayton Power & Light's 1.1 megawatt facility at 9975 Yankee St. in Washington Twp. began operating in 2010. \Ohio law has an alternative energy standard requiring that 25 percent of electricity sold by Ohio's electric distribution utilities or electric services companies be generated from alternative energy sources by 2025. At least half must be from renewables, such as solar, wind, biomass and hydro with a minimum of one-half percent from solar. One half of the renewable energy must be from Ohio installations. \Coal powers 86 percent of Ohio's electric generation, natural gas and other gases account for 2 percent, Nuclear power is 10 percent and wind, solar and hydro make up about 1 percent.\Credit: By Steve Bennish, Staff Writer"
1,"News-Leader\Jefferson City -- The hot- button issue of Missouri's law mandating ethanol be blended into gasoline re-emerged in a Senate agriculture committee hearing Wednesday.\Sen. Matt Bartle, R-Lee's Summit, presented his case for repealing the 13-month-old 10 percent ethanol standard before a Senate panel of mostly farmers, a few of whom have a financial interest in the biofuels industry.\By mandating ethanol be blended into gasoline when the corn-based alcohol is cheaper than regular gasoline, Bartle said the state has created a system of winners and losers, disrupting the free market system.\""We're coming along and saying 'government knows better,'"" Bartle said in a nearly 20-minute monologue that delved deeply into conservative economic philosophy. ""We are picking ethanol over other alternative (energy) technologies ... that might produce less dependence on foreign oil.""\Missouri's alternative energy standard went into effect Jan. 1, 2008. Until November of last year, most gasoline sold at stations in the state contained 10 percent ethanol, as mandated by the new law.\But when gasoline and oil prices plummeted this fall, the ethanol mandate was voided by a price- trigger requirement designed to ensure customers are only forced to buy ethanol-blended gasoline when it's less expensive.\Before the mandate, Bartle said, 70 percent of Missouri's gas stations and convenience stores sold gasoline with 10 percent ethanol, also known as E10, which most internal combustion vehicles can handle.\""I didn't need government to tell me that I had to buy one fuel or another,"" Bartle said.\And with ethanol producers already receiving a 51-cent per gallon federal subsidy, Bartle said the mandate ensures ethanol is profitable when the price of gas is high. He equated it to a ""welfare"" system for corn farmers.\Bartle said the ethanol mandate has more to do with corn farmers having a powerful lobby in Jefferson City than sound public policy.\""The reason we do it is because we all like corn farmers,"" Bartle told the panel, which includes three corn farmers.\Bartle also said livestock farmers have been adversely affected by the rising demand for field corn at ethanol plants, which extract the alcohol to make the fuel.\Despite Bartle's pleas for the committee to renew their faith in capitalism and vote out a repeal of the mandate, he wasn't getting much sympathy.\""None of us here are going to change our minds,"" said Sen. Frank Barnitz, a livestock farmer and Democrat from Lake Spring.\Chaired by Republican Sen. Dan Clemens, a Webster County farmer, the agriculture committee includes of some of the Senate's most ardent supporters of biofuels.\Sen. Wes Shoemyer, a Democrat and farmer in northeast Missouri, is an ethanol and biodiesel investor. Sen. Bill Stouffer, R-Napton, is a Saline County farmer and also has invested in a biodiesel plant.\Both Shoemyer and Stouffer have received state tax credits for their investments in agribusinesses while serving in the legislature, The Associated Press reported last year.\Shoemyer said the emergence of biofuels and the profits that have followed has made farming a financial reality for his children.\""I really believe that this made a difference for my kid to come back home,"" Shoemyer told Bartle.\Prior to Bartle's hearing, Stouffer presented a bill that would extend the mandate to diesel fuel, requiring all diesel is blended with 5 percent biodiesel, which typically comes from soybean oil.\Stouffer defended Bartle's claim that the ethanol mandate has diverted field corn from its traditional use for feeding livestock to ethanol plants, thus driving up the price of food in the grocery store.\Stouffer noted that since field corn, gasoline and ethanol prices dropped a few months ago, the price of food has remained the same.\""If ethanol was what pushed the price of food up, why haven't they gone down?"" Stouffer asked.\Stouffer said there's a ""social value"" for Missouri by depending on less foreign oil.\Bartle later told Stouffer: ""It's always tempting to force our people to buy things that they would not otherwise buy."""

GOV. John Kasich interrupted his presidential campaign last week to return to Ohio. While he was in Columbus, he asserted that he sees no need even to ask voters in 2016 whether they want the state to borrow as much as $1 billion to help pay to clean up Lake Erie and other key waterways. ""I don't see any reason to really do any more at this point,"" he said.
\
The governor added that he has no interest in reversing one of the worst failures of his administration: his acquiescence in the terrible decision last year by the Republican-controlled General Assembly to repudiate Ohio's standards to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. That measure was a transparent sop to Columbus' imposing fossil-fuel lobbies.
\
Mr. Kasich evidently believes that such positions burnish his credentials for national political leadership - or at least the GOP presidential nomination. Maybe the latter, but certainly not the former.
\
Northwest Ohioans do not need to be reminded that a harmful algae bloom in western Lake Erie generated a toxin that poisoned Toledo's water supply for three days in the summer of 2014, depriving nearly 500,000 consumers of their usual source of drinking water. A new study by scientists at Ohio State University and elsewhere warns that the number of major blooms in the lake, already chronically high, could double in the next 100 years.
\
Yet Mr. Kasich seems content with modest measures to limit agricultural pollution of Lake Erie's tributaries, such as a new law that restricts farmers' application of manure and chemical fertilizer on frozen or saturated ground. The governor has joined calls for a 40 percent reduction over the next decade in the amount of phosphorus, which feeds toxic algae, flowing into western Lake Erie. Some environmental scientists suggest that goal is already inadequate.
\
The proposal to place a clean-water bond issue on next year's statewide ballot is bipartisan; Republican state Sen. Randy Gardner of Bowling Green is one of its strongest advocates. It has support, at least in principle, from a range of environmental, farm, and business interests.
\
The plan would usefully address a variety of environmental risks - including toxic algae -to Lake Erie, the Ohio River, and other major bodies of water across the state. It seeks to reduce water pollution by a broad range of sources. A competing proposal would focus on sewer overflows.
\
Either way, Mr. Kasich's conspicuous disinterest in the ballot measure won't help. Last week, he instead blamed outsiders - other states, Detroit, Canada- for polluting Lake Erie.
\
The new Lake Erie study concludes that human-made climate change could""supercharge"" the growth of harmful algae. The two-year pause in Ohio's alternative-energy standard that the governor and legislature enacted last year is contributing to climate change by encouraging the state's over-reliance on fossil fuels, notably coal, to generate electric power. That outcome is at odds with, among other things, the new global agreement on climate change reached this month in Paris.
\
To his credit, Governor Kasich has rejected a legislative proposal to extend the freeze on energy standards indefinitely. But he also said last week that he doesn't want Ohio to revert fully to the former clean-energy mandates. That seems a distinction without much of a difference.
\
Mr. Kasich also has refused to petition the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to declare the western Lake Erie basin a""distressed"" watershed. That action would allow closer scrutiny and regulation of pollution sources such as the heavily subsidized factory farms known as concentrated animal feeding operations.
\
The Kasich administration claims that such a designation would impair the public image of the western Lake Erie region. Not as much as a reprise of Toledo's water crisis would.
\
During the Republican debate this month, Mr. Kasich outlined the elements of political victory next year in Ohio, a key swing state in presidential elections. A candidate's message, he insisted, ""has to be big and bold and positive.""
\
A comprehensive, meaningful plan to repair Lake Erie, the state's most vital natural asset, would fit that description admirably. But such an economic and environmental boon doesn't appear to be on the governor's agenda.
\
Voters are told repeatedly that Governor Kasich is the thoughtful, responsible, moderate candidate in the GOP presidential field. And compared to his rivals, he is. It's all relative, but that observation isn't particularly comforting.

Charlie Crist, the man without a party, still manages to find a way to be invited to one and deliver a message. President Barack Obama's invitation to the former Republican governor to speak at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday was attacked by Republicans in Florida and elsewhere as a desperate act by two self-serving politicians. But the reality is that Crist has a message to deliver about pragmatic governing based on consensus-building rather than ideological purity. When he felt unwelcome in his own political party, he left and changed his voter registration to no party affiliation. And that says more about the modern Republican Party than it does about the former Florida governor.
\
Crist said Tuesday that he will strive in his speech before an anticipated 65,000 people in a football stadium to give ""a fuller perspective on (Obama's) wonderful leadership."" And taken outside the partisan prism, it's not that surprising that Crist is backing Obama over the Republican nominee, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney.
\
As Florida governor from 2007-11, Crist's moderate agenda had more in common with the current Democratic platform than the stridently conservative one Republicans approved last week in Tampa at the Republican National Convention. Crist supported immigration reform, embraced stimulus funding as a way to keep Floridians working, backed public school teachers, sought to set a new alternative energy standard for the state to address climate change, provided a path for felons to get their civil rights restored, and even kept the polls open longer in 2008 for early voting.
\
Contrast that with today. In Florida under Gov. Rick Scott, Republicans have made it harder to register to vote and cast ballots. The governor rejected $2.4 billion for high-speed rail linking Tampa to Orlando, and he and legislative leaders have refused to accept millions in federal money for health care reform and to help low-income pregnant women. Scott signed a budget that cut $1.3 billion in public education last year, then bragged this year that the state had increased education spending by $1 billion when the truth is that Florida is still spending less on education than when he took office.
\
Of course, Crist is not wholly in line with Obama and Democrats - which actually makes his appearance more refreshing. He has repeatedly opposed raising taxes and gun control. He is no supporter of abortion rights and gay marriage. But on social issues, he has been a live-and-let-live lawmaker and has said the current GOP platform outlawing all abortions goes too far. Crist is a populist, and there is little room for populists anymore in the Republican Party.
\
Some have seen Crist's defection to Obama's camp as opportunistic, giving the possible future candidate a chance to address a national audience. But the real importance of Crist's presence is as a symbol of moderation and cooperation. Americans from different perspectives can work together for common goals toward a better future, even if they don't agree on everything. That is the antidote to extremism, writ large.

Progress Energy Florida leaders are emphatic that they want to repair the utility's Crystal River nuclear plant and return it to operation. But their acknowledgement last week that shuttering the nuclear plant might eventually prove more financially pragmatic caught customers of the state's second-largest utility by surprise. Now Progress Energy's long-assumed strategy for providing power for the region hangs in the balance given the uncertain future of the Crystal River plant and the continued ambiguity about whether a proposed nuclear plant will be built in Levy County. As Progress Energy proposes its solution for Crystal River, it must make a convincing argument that the fix will work, the expense will be prudent and the facility will continue to function safely.
\
Nothing about the recent events at Crystal River is encouraging. Discovery of a gap in the nuclear reactor's containment wall during scheduled maintenance took the facility off line in 2009, forcing the utility to shift power generation to coal or gas plants and increasing fuel costs. As repairs to the gap in one of the wall's six panels were near completion last month, the utility found a second gap in another panel. Progress Energy says it will update Florida's Public Service Commission on June 27 about its plan for repairs.
\
But there is no guarantee the facility will eventually return to service, prompting the acknowledgement last week that decommissioning the plant remains an option. Progress Energy's proposed fix for Crystal River will need to pass muster with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which deals with safety and operational issues, and the PSC, which will decide how the repairs or a decommissioning will be financed. Progress Energy is not yet offering cost estimates for either option beyond the $440 million that's already been spent. But neither alternative would be cheap.
\
Those costs, and how much insurance will cover, will clearly weigh heavily in the utility's decision. But so too should the long-term costs for its 1.6 million customers, whether that's for repairs or for decommissioning and the cost of switching to more expensive fuels such as natural gas.
\
Unfortunately, Progress Energy will make a final decision on Crystal River in the absence of any state or federal energy policy aimed at tackling the long-term need of both Florida and the nation to diversify the power supply and lessen the dependence on ozone-damaging fossil fuels. President Barack Obama and Congress remain paralyzed on the issue, and, when he was governor, Charlie Crist's effort to encourage an alternative energy standard fell largely on deaf ears in the Republican-led Legislature.
\
A clear energy policy would give Progress Energy and the public a far better understanding of the broader implications for repairing the Crystal River plant long term or replacing it with a combination of other technologies, be it natural gas or renewable solar or wind. Short of that, however, Progress Energy must remain forthcoming about its options, emphasize safety and respect its customers' financial interests in making a final proposal for moving forward.

COLUMBUS -- An environmental group on Wednesday launched a campaign urging Ohioans to boycott FirstEnergy Corp.'s marketing arm to protest what it says are efforts by Toledo Edison to undercut Ohio's renewable energy and efficiency standards.
\
""It is time for us to stop FirstEnergy,"" said Dan Sawmiller, senior representative of Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign in Ohio. ""We will not stand by any longer without taking direct action.""
\
The first electronic billboard has gone up across from the Statehouse in Columbus where lawmakers may soon revisit Ohio's 2008 law requiring utilities to find at least 25 percent of their power from renewable or advanced technology sources by 2025.
\
FirstEnergy Solutions, the retail electricity supplier affiliate of the Akron-based utility, markets itself as an alternative to traditional utilities -- including FirstEnergy itself -- in multiple states in the Midwest and the East. Central Ohio is a major marketing target because FirstEnergy Solutions has been going after customers of American Electric Power there.
\
The boycott campaign plans paid advertising, online ads, mailers, and direct contact to urge consumers to sign a pledge that they will not sign a contract to buy their power from FirstEnergy Solutions.
\
Under state law, half of the 25 percent alternative energy standard, or 12.5 percent, must come from renewable sources such as wind, solar, and landfill gases. Half a percentage point must come from solar.
\
The advanced sources can also include such things as nuclear, fuel cells, and cleaner coal technology. Most of Ohio's electricity comes from coal-fired power plants.
\
The requirement for renewable and advanced energy could be suspended once the cost to consumers increases by more than 3 percent, but no utility has yet invoked that cap.
\
""We're not aware of any impact [the Sierra Club campaign] may be having, but we certainly feel their campaign is misleading,"" said FirstEnergy spokesman Doug Colafella.
\
""Like other utilities in Ohio, we have programs that help customers reduce their energy use,"" he said. ""It's a shame that this campaign could mislead customers into missing out on reducing their electric bills by switching to FirstEnergy Solutions.""
\
The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio recently ordered FirstEnergy Corp. to refund $43.3 million to its 2 million customers for overcharging them for renewable energy credits it acquired through its subsidiary to comply with the law. On Wednesday, at the request of multiple parties on both sides, including FirstEnergy, the PUCO agreed to reopen the case.
\
Ohio Sen. Bill Seitz (R., Cincinnati) is expected to introduce a bill sometime this fall to revisit the standards, with the emphasis expected to be primarily on efficiency as opposed to renewable energy.

6,"Money to repair highways, rising health-care costs and controversies surrounding attempts to combat global warming are among topics the nation's governors plan to tackle when they gather this week in West Virginia. The National Governors Association summer meeting, which runs until Saturday at The Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, comes as states find themselves grappling with an array of issues that defy easy answers. Those include long-range funding for infrastructure upgrades, the effects of prolonged drought and adequately funding public schools and colleges.\States' economic conditions generally have improved since the national recession, but the retirement of the baby boom population will put pressure on governments as public pension and health care costs continue to rise, said Jack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College in southern California.\""In the short term, it's not too bad because the economy has been recovering and a lot of the states are not in those dire fiscal situations they were in a few years ago, Pitney said. ""However, every farsighted state governor knows the good times won't last.\Some storm clouds already are appearing. An Associated Press analysis this spring found that at least 22 states will be dealing with budget shortfalls for the 2016 fiscal year. This month, the AP also found that enrollments and costs have surged way beyond projections in many of the states that opted to expand Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act.\Because Medicaid costs account for such a large part of state budgets, that is raising concerns that states will have to make cuts in education and other areas to afford the low-income health care program once the federal government begins reducing its share.\Missing from the conference will be the four governors who are vying for the Republican nomination for president next year. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, John Kasich of Ohio and Scott Walker of Wisconsin have commitments elsewhere, according to their staffs and campaign officials.\Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, the association chairman, and Republican Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah, the vice chairman, did not make themselves available for interviews before the meeting.\West Virginia's struggling southern coalfields help illustrate the divide between governors who urge swift action on climate change and those who are fighting regulations against greenhouse gas emissions because of their state's reliance on the fossil fuel industry.\California Gov. Jerry Brown had been scheduled to give an address at the conference but instead flew to Rome, where he attended a Vatican summit called by Pope Francis following the release of his encyclical on climate change and poverty. In a speech Tuesday, Brown said global warming deniers were putting ""troglodytes into office rather than environmentally responsible leaders.\The Democratic governor is pushing a state plan that his administration calls the most aggressive carbon-reduction benchmark in North America. It would increase statewide renewable electricity use to 50 percent, have drivers use half as much gasoline and make buildings twice as energy-efficient as they are now.\By comparison, elected officials from both parties in West Virginia blast the Obama administration's push to curb greenhouse gas emissions. They say the regulations unfairly target an already-fizzling Appalachian coal industry.\The state has led or joined lawsuits against several U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations.\This year, West Virginia got rid of its state alternative energy standard, although it was hardly strict. Burning many types of coal - and even tires - counted as alternative energy. The coal industry helped write the law in the first place but came out in opposition to it this year.\""When we look at changes in our policy in this country, we need to also look at the economics involved with it and what effect it's having on coal states, said West Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, a Democrat. ""Obviously, we can all see what effect it's having here in West Virginia, as far as the loss of jobs and, which goes along with that, the loss in tax dollars.\Faced with ballooning health-care costs, governors also will hear from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell, a West Virginia native. U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Thomas Perez will be the other high-level federal official addressing the group.\Governors also are anxiously awaiting action from Congress on a transportation bill as their roads, highways and bridges worsen. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, announced a deal on a six-year funding bill earlier this week, but it immediately ran into procedural delays from Democrats.\Authority for transportation programs expires July 31, which would eliminate the transportation department's ability to process promised highway and transit aid to states.\Already, the total money available to states from the Federal Highway Trust Fund has declined 3.5 percent during the five-year period ending in 2013, according to figures compiled by The Associated Press.\Some states, including ones like Michigan with Republican leadership, are mulling tax and fee hikes to address pressing road problems.\Credit: Jonathan Mattise The Associated Press"
7,"While efforts to boost the use of natural gas as an alternative fuel in Oklahoma continue to gain momentum, those efforts need to continue, energy experts said last week.\In a media statement issued by outgoing House Speaker Chris Benge, the lawmaker said business leaders are showing increased interest in developing the state's natural gas market.\""From a public policy standpoint, energy security is one of the top issues facing this country right now,"" said Benge, R-Tulsa. ""It's clear that both Oklahoma's citizens and business leaders are embracing this idea and joining the effort to promote locally produced fuels like natural gas.""\Officials with the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association agreed.\""Several private companies, including Apache Corp. and Chesapeake Energy, are replacing their regular fuel vehicles with natural gas-powered vehicles,"" said Cody Bannister, OIPA spokesman.\Bannister said the biggest change could be spawned in fleet vehicles.\""The biggest gain is in fleet vehicles,"" he said. ""Companies are replacing cars and trucks that typically run the same routes with natural gas vehicles. Those are the most viable options.""\Benge agreed. Speaking at a Tulsa Metro Chamber event last week, he said the state is at the forefront in expanding the nation's natural gas market.\""When looking at alternative fuels, the no-brainer for Oklahoma is natural gas,"" Benge said. ""It creates jobs in Oklahoma and provides greater energy security for the country.""\Industry studies show the United States spends about $100 million per day on imported oil, including oil generated in regions hostile to Americans. But at the same time, those studies show an estimated 100-year supply of natural gas is still available for production on the American continent.\""And that supply is increasing, thanks to successful technological advancements in horizontal drilling,"" Benge said.\Benge said energy security - on the state and national level - has been a focal point of his tenure as speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives.\He said state lawmakers have enacted policies that encourage the use of natural gas for vehicles and the installation of corresponding fueling infrastructure and continue to develop proposals for the development of the fueling infrastructure.\""We want to be aggressive in building the network of fueling stations,"" he said. ""As a result of Oklahoma's policies, there are currently around a dozen more natural gas fueling stations in the development pipeline.""\Bannister said those ideas would allow natural gas to be used as a ""bridge fuel"" as the country makes a switch from petroleum to other energy sources.\""We've seen a lot of promotion for natural gas as a bridge fuel,"" he said. ""It's here, it's affordable and it's accessible.""\And new technologies, Bannister said, have expanded the supply.\""The use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have opened vast amounts of natural gas across the country that were, 20 years ago, unproducable,"" he said.\To help develop the state's market for natural gas, Benge said lawmakers passed the Oklahoma Energy Security Act this year, which set an alternative-energy goal, including having one public natural gas fueling station every 100 miles along the state's interstate system by the year 2015 and every 50 miles by 2025.\""Oklahoma is reportedly the only state with an alternative-energy standard set specifically for natural gas,"" he said.\Benge said the price advantage of natural gas, along with the increased energy security, will make the fuel a major part of the national energy policy discussion.\""Everyone was really focused on this issue when gasoline was $4 per gallon,"" he said. ""I don't want the public to forget we still have a real challenge ahead of us. Prices may have come down from a high of a couple of years ago, but we are still facing the need to address the nation's energy security.""\That's the right direction, Bannister said.\""We taken some great first steps to develop the market,"" he said. ""But there are still more steps to take.""\Credit: M. Scott Carter"
8,"The day after West Virginia Republican lawmakers started tax reform talks, coal giant Murray Energy laid off 214 miners with a clear message calling for lower state taxes to unearth coal. After last week's layoffs, Murray's subsidiary condemned the Obama administration and lamented cheaper natural gas reserves. What surprised Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, though, was that Murray blasted the state coal severance tax as ""extremely excessive.\""That's really the first time I've had anyone say anything about our severance tax, said Tomblin, a Democrat.\The tax will be under review as the GOP-led Legislature mulls ways to reshape the tax code, said Senate President Bill Cole, R-Mercer.\During the industry's downturn, the spigot of coal severance cash has slowed considerably. Tomblin expressed concerns about trying to cut an already-shrinking revenue source that helps cover a variety of costs, from education to health care.\A chunk also goes back to county governments. Recently, struggling southern coal counties have laid off law enforcement officers and made other cuts, attributing them at least partly to falling severance money.\""One of the things we're blessed with is our energy in West Virginia, Tomblin said. ""I can't imagine right now reducing the taxes.\Cole called the tax review ""the next step to help coal, after passing bills last session to trim mining regulations and scrap a state alternative energy standard. Tomblin signed both.\A committee on tax reform is underway, and the next session starts in January.\Robert Murray, the company's namesake and a loud critic of President Obama's energy policies, just last week bet even bigger on coal. Murray Energy paid $1.4 billion for a controlling interest of Foresight Energy, which mines the thick coal seams in the Illinois Basin. Murray's West Virginia mines are up north, which has remained a more productive region than the state's thinning southern seams.\The coal executive also gave state Republicans a big lift last election. His company's $250,000 donation to a conservative super PAC was one of the biggest all cycle, and helped lift Republicans to their first state legislative majorities in more than eight decades.\At the federal level, Murray and other coal operators say they'll be crippled by Obama's climate change pushes, which call for reductions in carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants.\At the state level, the company says coal pays well more than its fair share.\Other than a surtax likely disappearing next year, the coal severance tax hasn't been raised since 1989. In 1997, mines with thinner seams got a break.\Companies now pay 1, 2 or 5 percent, depending on seam thickness.\Since December 2005, producers have paid 56 cents per ton to cover a worker's compensation debt, a tax expected to be dropped sometime next year, according to the Department of Revenue.\Combined, coal severance brought in $407.2 million last budget year, including $63.7 million for the debt payback. That's compared to $451.6 million in 2013 and $531.1 million in 2012.\Similar taxes exist for extracting resources like natural gas, which has boomed and helped prop up the budget during coal's decline.\It's hard to compare severance taxes across states because different coal burns at different rates, state Deputy Revenue Secretary Mark Muchow said.\Wyoming charges 3.74 percent underground and 7 percent for surface mining; Kentucky taxes a flat 4.5 percent; Pennsylvania has none; Ohio levies 10 cents per ton, plus reclamation fees; and North Dakota taxes 37.5 cents per ton, according to the West Virginia Department of Revenue.\West Virginia Coal Association President Bill Raney said the state's severance tax level puts it at a competitive disadvantage. However, he doesn't want money that goes to counties cut, either.\""I think there's a balance in there, Raney said. ""I don't know where that line is.\Credit: JONATHAN MATTISE The Associated Press"

\
WOOSTER -- Whichever candidate is elected as state representative in the 3rd District will likely take with him some new ideas about education, business and the role of government.
\
Republican Ron Amstutz, who now serves in the Ohio Senate, is running against Democrat Merle Joe Miller for state representative.
\
Both have differing views on the major issues and different goals about how to improve the state's education system and economy.
\
Amstutz said one of the biggest tasks is helping Ohioans become more connected with the workplace. He said internships and similar programs are a necessary means of engaging students with the work world and that such programs should start as early as the sixth-grade.
\
""The seeds for that need to be planted earlier and started earlier,"" he said. ""I think there's a whole lot of students that have no connections for work, all the way through high school even. It's not true for all, but it's true for a lot.""
\
Miller, who is vice president of sales for the Santmyer Oil Co., supports a modified version of President Ronald Reagan's plan to get the most out of school days, school years and curriculum. He advocates extending the school year to about 230 days and the school day by 30-60 minutes.
\
Additionally, Miller said high school students should be required to study four years of English (as most already require), four years of science and math and that foreign language should begin in the sixth grade, possibly the third grade.
\
Miller said these standards would cost more and require more support by educators and communities, but it is the kind of direction he thinks education should go.
\
""That's the kind of effort we need in our education,"" he said.
\
Along with better education, which both candidates said will improve graduates for the demands of today's jobs, both candidates also support the work of BioHio, which they expect to create some of the jobs students pursue.
\
Amstutz said BioHio has already attracted existing businesses, such as Schmack BioEnergy, which produces biogas, and will continue to do so as it develops.
\
""All the major research universities in Ohio and beyond have been pushing to do this,"" Amstutz said. ""It's part of jump-starting our economy. It's not the only thing, by any means, but it's a very important frontier for us to be working in.""
\
Miller said Ohio is behind in its pursuit of alternative energy and acting on a bioenergy standard, which is largely why he's running for office. He said of BioHio that he's ""encouraged that we can encourage research to come in and to do research in our part of the country.""
\
Miller said he has invested in a biodiesel plant in Toledo, expected to begin production in about a month, something he said the local area could also support. He's also working on a project in Toledo to turn seaweed into usable energy, which he said if works there, then it could also work in Wayne County.
\
""We have to encourage this industry to come in,"" Miller said. ""If it's (BioHio) like Toledo, once you get industry in, one thing leads to another.""
\
Amstutz said some of the specific changes he hopes to make are with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and the Bureau of Workers' Compensation.
\
Both, he said, have lost their focus and are hurting the business community, especially medium- to small-sized businesses. The problem with the EPA, he said, is communities are being fined for issues related to paperwork.
\
""We've got to break that cycle because it is a very discouraging thing to our business community when they come up against these almost 'attack fines' from the OEPA,"" Amstutz said.
\
As for Workers' Compensation, Amstutz said the problem isn't in legitimate claims, but instead is in claims that defeat the program's purpose.
\
""It (Worker's Compensation) has a very important purpose, but that purpose has been sidetracked by inappropriate abuse by the trial attorneys,"" Amstutz said.
\
Miller said his biggest focus in the House will be to improve the state's standing with alternative energy, and get it to become more business-oriented.
\
He said the biggest issue is ""inaction from the state government standpoint. Ohio has not been an aggressive state to go out and get industry.""
\
Miller said the state is ""dead last"" in establishing alternative energy for Ohio, which he said is the result of inaction.
\
""I would like to see Ohio go to a minimum (ethanol requirement) of 15 percent, if not 20 percent, on all vehicles the next three-five years,"" he said.
\
Miller said he understands the impact increased ethanol production could have on the area's livestock farmers, who would likely be faced with higher feed bills, but that many also produce their own feed and that more benefit from higher grain prices than do not.
\
""Some of these grain farmers have made more money the past three or four years than they have for years and years,"" Miller said. ""Yes, they (livestock farmers) get hurt in the situation, but you can't scrap the whole thing because a few people get hurt.""
\
Amstutz said the state has adopted a standard with Gov. Ted Strickland's alternative energy standard, which requires that by 2025 at least 25 percent of the state's electricity be produced by advanced energy technology.
\
He said the state has also identified fuel cells as an area Ohio can succeed and has several ongoing efforts already in place, including at Case Western Reserve University.
\
Miller said he plans to apply business principles he gained in the gas industry to the government, and the idea of taking action on whatever front is necessary, reducing the number of government employees and offices, if necessary.
\
""You cannot use this mindset of things will take care of themselves, problems will take care of themselves and do nothing,"" he said. ""You have to go in and take on the problems of the day.""
\
Amstutz said he plans to carry his eight years in the Ohio Senate into office, along with his ""experience, expertise and passion for service."" He spent 20 years as a state representative for this area before becoming a senator.
\
He said he especially plans to work the separation between rural and central urban areas, to ""try to help people in those areas find a way to improve themselves.""

10,"The day after West Virginia Republican lawmakers started tax reform talks, coal giant Murray Energy laid off 214 miners with a clear message calling for lower state taxes to unearth coal. After last week's layoffs, Murray's subsidiary condemned the Obama administration and lamented cheaper natural gas reserves. What surprised Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, though, was that Murray blasted the state coal severance tax as ""extremely excessive.\""That's really the first time I've had anyone say anything about our severance tax, said Tomblin, a Democrat.\The tax will be under review as the GOP-led Legislature mulls over ways to reshape the tax code, said Senate President Bill Cole, R-Mercer.\During the industry's downturn, the spigot of coal severance cash has slowed considerably. Tomblin expressed concerns about trying to cut an already-shrinking revenue source that helps cover a variety of costs, from education to health care.\A chunk also goes back to county governments. Recently, struggling southern coal counties have laid off law enforcement officers and made other cuts, attributing them at least partly to falling severance money.\""One of the things we're blessed with is our energy in West Virginia, Tomblin said. ""I can't imagine right now reducing the taxes.\Cole called the tax review ""the next step"" to help coal, after passing bills last session to trim mining regulations and scrap a state alternative energy standard. Tomblin signed both.\A committee on tax reform is underway, and the next session starts in January.\Robert Murray, the company's namesake and a loud critic of President Obama's energy policies, just last week bet even bigger on coal. Murray Energy paid $1.4 billion for a controlling interest in Foresight Energy, which mines the thick coal seams in the Illinois Basin. Murray's West Virginia mines are up north, which has remained a more productive region than the state's thinning southern seams.\The coal executive also gave state Republicans a big lift last election. His company's $250,000 donation to a conservative super PAC was one of the biggest all cycle, and helped lift Republicans to their first state legislative majorities in more than eight decades.\At the federal level, Murray and other coal operators say they'll be crippled by Obama's climate change pushes, which call for reductions in carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants.\At the state level, the company says coal pays well more than its fair share.\Other than a surtax likely disappearing next year, the coal severance tax hasn't been raised since 1989. In 1997, mines with thinner seams got a break.\Companies now pay 1, 2 or 5 percent, depending on seam thickness.\Since December 2005, producers have paid 56 cents per ton to cover a worker's compensation debt, a tax expected to be dropped sometime next year, according to the Department of Revenue.\Combined, coal severance brought in $407.2 million last budget year, including $63.7 million for the debt payback. That's compared to $451.6 million in 2013 and $531.1 million in 2012.\Similar taxes exist for extracting resources like natural gas, which has boomed and helped prop up the budget during coal's decline.\It's hard to compare severance taxes across states because different coal burns at different rates, Deputy Revenue Secretary Mark Muchow said.\Wyoming charges 3.74 percent underground and 7 percent for surface mining; Kentucky taxes a flat 4.5 percent; Pennsylvania has none; Ohio levies 10 cents per ton, plus reclamation fees; and North Dakota taxes 37.5 cents per ton, according to the West Virginia Department of Revenue.\West Virginia Coal Association President Bill Raney said the state's severance tax level puts it at a competitive disadvantage. However, he doesn't want money that goes to counties cut, either.\Credit: Jonathan Mattise The Associated Press"
11,"When the dust settles from the end-of-the-session bill-passing frenzy, environmental groups said yesterday, they believe that the legislature's action on some issues - and inaction on others - will mean mixed results for the state's environment.\Sailing through the legislature were an energy bill hailed as a landmark for requiring utilities to buy some of their electricity from alternative-energy sources and a controversial measure to provide funding to rebuild and repair aging sewer and water systems.\But Gov. Rendell's proposed Growing Greener II program was not acted on. The $800 million program was designed to provide dedicated funding for hazardous-waste cleanup and watershed improvements and expand open space and farmland protection.\The bill failed to move because Republicans and industry groups remain staunchly opposed to Rendell's plan to fund the program by imposing fees on polluters and increasing landfill fees.\But Kathleen McGinty, secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection, said in an interview yesterday that failure to approve the funding would have an impact on public health.\With funds rapidly dwindling, she said, her agency has already been forced to scale back its effort to clean up dozens of polluted sites, including wells in East Norriton Township in Montgomery County contaminated with a chemical used in dry cleaning.\The renewable energy bill, which caused a rare division among the state's leading environmental groups, would require that utilities buy 18 percent of their electricity from environmentally friendly sources within 15 years.\Under the bill, the state will have eight times more so-called ""green"" energy - most of it wind power - than it does now, said John Hanger, president of the environmental group PennFuture.\Almost half of that amount would come from wind turbines, solar panels and methane gas emitted by decomposing trash in landfills. The rest would come from a second ""tier"" that includes garbage incinerators, ""waste"" coal and energy efficiency.\Supporters, including Rendell - who said he would sign the bill - believe the green energy would not cost consumers any more than traditional sources and would be a plus for the state's economy and the environment.\Philadelphia-based Peco Energy Co. was among the supporters, after its analysis showed that the bill would not raise rates for customers at least through 2010, spokesman Michael Wood said.\The state already comes close to meeting the target for the second-tier sources - most of it from waste coal, said John Hanger, a former member of the Public Utility Commission.\The bill sparked a rare schism among the environmental movement. Hanger praised it as ""revolutionary,"" while several groups decried the inclusion of incinerators and waste coal.\""These are just inherently dirty resources and they shouldn't be included in an alternative energy standard,"" said Nathan Willcox, an energy advocate at the group PennEnvironment.\Waste coal is the term for coal that is not pure enough to be burned in typical power plants. As of December 2003, at least 258 million tons of waste coal sat in unsightly piles across the state, threatening water quality, according to the Department of Environmental Protection.\Environmentalists also are concerned about the effects of a bill authorizing the spending of $250 million for sewer and water projects, which was approved by voters last May. They say amendments added to the authorization bill will encourage sprawl, rather than prevent it as originally intended.\""The conditions for eligibility for funding have changed, and the language directing money toward fixing what's broken has been removed,"" said Robin Mann, water chairwoman for the Sierra Club, Pennsylvania Chapter.\But McGinty said she was confident the money would go toward its intended purpose: to rebuild and repair aging infrastructure in cities, towns and boroughs.\Meanwhile, Republican leaders yesterday said the legislature would not take up Growing Greener II until the General Assembly returned to work in January.\Rendell, seeking to compel lawmakers back to work this week because their session does not officially end until Nov. 30, has accused the Republican leadership of breaking its promise to advance the Growing Greener II initiative before the end of the session.\But Republicans say there was no such agreement.\Contact staff writer Amy Worden at 717-783-2584 or aworden@phillynews.com.\ \Credit: By Amy Worden and Tom Avril INQUIRER STAFF WRITERS"
12,"A global warming skeptic and leading climate change expert plan to debate the potential impact of cap-and-trade legislation on West Virginia's economy. \David Hawkins, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's Climate Center, and Patrick Michaels, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, will face off at 6 p.m. Monday at University of Charleston's Geary Auditorium.\Under legislation passed by the U.S. House and now under consideration in the Senate, the federal government would set limits on carbon dioxide emissions. Businesses would then buy and sell permits to emit the gasses.\Hawkins says the proposal would provide opportunities for economic growth.\Michaels says the proposal would lead to job losses in mining, trucking railroad and other industries.\""Cap and trade is a very difficult issue to discuss,"" said UC President Ed Welch, who will moderate the debate. ""One side says that cap and trade would devastate the economy of West Virginia, while the other side believes that without it we will destroy our environment. I hope we can have a real dialogue on what cap-and-trade proposals mean to West Virginia.""\The Rotary Club of Charleston is organizing the debate, which is open to the public. The Charleston Gazette and Charleston Daily Mail are the event's main sponsors."
13,"Just a year ago, ""cap-and-trade"" was about to save the planet from being cooked by global warming, if only we in Congress could recognize the threat and embrace the elegant solution.\That was then. Now the brave, new economic system that was supposed to cap carbon dioxide emissions and let emitters buy and sell allowances in a government market that mimics capitalism is proving to be less a solution than a problem. Even the Congress-knows-\best crowd is admitting that they can't figure out how to make it work, and cap-and-trade's most avid proponent in the House - Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) - indicates that she may not get around to legislating this year, after all.\Her California colleague, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D), pushed a cap-and-trade bill that has turned out to be a window on the difficulties. By some estimates, it would cut America's gross domestic product by 2.3 percent inside of seven years and raise average energy costs for households by $1,740 per year within 12 years. In the Midwest and Great Plains, the added cost for a household tops $2,000, and in Texas and Oklahoma, it's more than $3,000. \We don't have to see very far ahead to observe what's wrong, though. We can look to Europe right now and notice a cap-and-trade system that was created to meet emission reduction goals under the Kyoto accords. Not only won't the goals be met, both emissions and the cost of electricity are increasing. Germany, for example, has achieved a 30 percent hike in the cost of wholesale electricity, along with a bulge in unemployment to 9.5 percent. Higher emissions, higher prices and higher unemployment are not the results I want to emulate in the United States. I've accepted the European lesson that prosperity is at risk under cap-and-trade, and maybe Democrats are starting to recognize it, too.\Global warming is a trillion-dollar problem, and we've always taken it seriously on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Under Republican and then Democratic leadership, we have been assembling a remarkably thorough record of facts and views from experts.\The more we learn, the more I believe we need to apply a common-sense test to any lawmaking that might follow: We want to keep the lights on; we don't want the cost of using energy to bankrupt working people; we want them to drive what they want to drive and go where they need to go; and above all, we want them to keep their jobs. \America has big energy challenges in the next 20 years. Electricity production must grow by at least 40 percent. The demand for motor and aviation fuels is expected to increase 1 percent to 3 percent a year, and the requirement for natural gas to heat our homes, cook our food and fuel our industry is headed up. That's why I welcomed the agreement between BP and ConocoPhillips to build a new natural gas pipeline from Alaska. We've gotten by with the same gas supply levels for a decade, and you can see it in the cost of heating a house even after a 19 percent demand reduction by industrial gas users. \In short, life and prosperity in America require energy, and we've got large domestic reserves of it right here in the neighborhood. Maybe that's the most important aspect of the pipeline agreement - it's a move to be self-reliant instead of betting more of our future on energy from across the oceans.\Another problem with adopting a cap-and-trade program for the United States is that even if we want one, it is very unlikely that developing nations would do the same. Some argue that America needs to cap emissions unilaterally because doing so will inspire the world's big polluters like China and India to follow us. China, the planet's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, isn't interested. Each year, China adds more coal-fired electricity generation than all the power in Texas, and Texas is the U.S. leader in electricity generation.\China is committed to raising its enormous population from poverty, and it has given every indication that it intends to stick with the current policy of breakneck economic development and job creation. China argues that it has the right to grow and raise its standard of living closer to ours, and if we want to reduce worldwide emissions, we should do it by ourselves.\In summary, cap-and-trade works badly in Europe, is DOA in Asia and makes no economic sense in America. \So what's the answer? We could begin by not abandoning hope and trying to tell people all the things they can't do - can't drive to work, can't turn on the lights, can't ... well, you name it. Contrary to the frenzied reporting on the subject, the science of global warming is not settled, carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and prosperity is not evil. But if we ultimately decide that some kind of action makes sense, let's start by helping our people find ways to succeed instead explaining all the things they'll no longer be permitted to do. \I, for one, haven't given up on the quaint idea that innovation and ingenuity will respond to consumer demand in a free market. Washington is full of talk about the rise of ""green-collar"" jobs, but nearly everybody here thinks a green-collar worker is a government employee. \The trick for policymakers, scientists and industry will be to get new, low-\carbon technologies out of the laboratory and into homes, cars and businesses by inventing products and services to sell instead of rules to impose.\We all want a clean environment, and I believe we can have one. I also believe we can have economic prosperity and job growth if we use market forces, not government mandates, to join the two together.\Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) is ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee."
14,"WHEN Congress returns from its summer recess, the U.S. Senate is expected to begin consideration of the House Bill 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, otherwise known as ""cap and trade.""\While the House of Representatives narrowly passed (219-212) this legislation at the end of June, I am thankful that West Virginia's three representatives - Alan Mollohan, Shelley Moore Capito and Nick Rahall - stood up for our state and voted against this.\Now it is time for Sens. Robert Byrd and Jay Rockefeller to work to defeat this proposal once and for all.\Byrd already has come out and has stated his opposition to HR 2454, and Rockefeller has said he has ""serious reservations.""\This is good news, but they need to go further. The West Virginia Chamber of Commerce urges our senators to fight against this legislation on the Senate floor and to exercise their clout and seniority to defeat this legislation.\The bill would severely hurt West Virginia by threatening the economic use of coal, establishing even more burdensome federal regulations, piling new costs on state manufacturers and businesses, and imposing a new tax on everyone.\Here are some unnerving statistics about House bill 2454, from a study prepared recently by the National Association of Manufacturers. The measure would:\* Cause an estimated 2.4 million jobs to be lost by 2030, which will result in a 6 percent to 7 percent drop in domestic manufacturing jobs.\* Reduce industrial input by 5.3 percent to 6.5 percent by 2030.\* Raise electricity prices between 31 percent and 50 percent by 2030.\* Drop coal production by 38 percent by 2020 and up to 75 percent by 2030..\* Cause a decline in annual American household income of between $730 and $1,248\This report shows West Virginia will be one of 15 states disproportionately impacted by passage of HR 2454. This is a very high price to pay for legislation that does more to provide for ""income redistribution"" than to help the environment.\While employers appreciate the various points of view surrounding climate change and environmental issues, how Congress addresses this matter will have a bearing on our state's overall well-being, on our jobs, on our families' incomes, and on energy costs.\The West Virginia chamber, along with other national groups, suggests that climate change should be addressed as part of an overall energy strategy that balances a number of issues, including sustaining a healthy economy, encouraging better use of energy, and nurturing investments in our existing energy industry and in new technologies:\* Efficiency: We must find more ways to encourage energy consumers and producers to use fuel and power more efficiently by improving building designs and appliance standards, and by improving our electricity and transportation infrastructure.\* Technology: Government and businesses should promote investment in and use of new technologies that use traditional sources more cleanly and examine how we can incorporate emerging and alternative energies as part of our nation's energy production portfolio.\* Global action: The United States should exert strong, inclusive global leadership to conclude a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol that emphasizes technology, efficiency, and flexibility and includes ALL greenhouse gas emitters.\West Virginians will be hurt severely by HR 2454 and by the continued, ludicrous attacks on our nation's affordable, abundant energy supplies.\Think of the results here in West Virginia of what the House of Representatives is proposing - significant increases in electricity prices; devastation of our energy sector; the loss of thousands of mining and manufacturing jobs; cuts in schools, public safety, community services, and health care; and the loss of millions and millions in tax revenues.\Worse, if we continue to restrict domestic production and impose new costs and hardships on industries and businesses, then America as a whole will be less competitive, jobs and investment will continue to go overseas - and we will be more dependent on foreign supplies of energy.\HR 2454 is a recipe for disaster.\Now is the time to speak up for our state's future and to defend our livelihoods. The U.S. Senate needs to defeat this legislation."
15,"Supporters of cap-and-trade climate change legislation are looking to the unfolding Senate floor debate this week to map out how the sweeping bill can be enacted into law during the next Congress and under a new president.\""This is why we have to get started, because it won't happen in a day,"" said Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who last month acknowledged that the bill faces an uphill fight. ""It's a very long road to get this done.""\Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Energy Independence and Global Warming Committee, similarly conceded last week that a cap-and-trade bill he introduced on Wednesday faces long odds. Still, he said, the effort must get under way.\""We must move as far as we can to put together the best ideas to save the planet,"" he said. ""We must have legislation ready for the next president.""\The comments by Boxer and Markey underscore the silver lining cap-and-trade supporters see in the current debate: Don't despair if legislation stalls this year because a more favorable political climate lies just around the corner. \While President Bush remains opposed to mandatory controls for reducing greenhouse gases, all three leading presidential candidates support cap-and-trade, under which the government caps annual emissions and issues tradable permits that create a financial incentive to reduce pollution.\""The debate, starting Jan. 20 of next year, will no longer be between 'yes' and 'no,'"" Markey said. ""It will be between different types of 'yeses.'"" \Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) was one of the first Senators to introduce cap-and-trade legislation, although he is cool to the proposal being debated in the Senate this week -- the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act (S. 3036), which he says does not go far enough to encourage nuclear power. Nuclear is touted by some policymakers because it does not produce greenhouse emissions.\Both Democratic presidential contenders, Sens. Barack Obama (Ill.) and Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.), support the bill, and they are also co-sponsors of another cap-and-trade measure with even more stringent emissions-reduction targets than the Lieberman-Warner bill has. Lieberman-Warner aims to lower emissions to roughly 70 percent below current levels by 2050. \In contrast, McCain last month endorsed a slightly lower overall emissions goal -- at least 66 percent below 2005 levels by 2050. That calculus will affect Boxer's strategy moving forward in the next Congress, when she hopes to draft a bill with the new administration.\""Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton want a stronger bill. McCain wants a weaker bill,"" she noted last month. ""Whoever's in the White House, we'll have to sit down and write a bill, hopefully together, that we'll be able to move.""\The November elections could also ease passage if predictions of Democratic gains in the House and Senate prove accurate. \But Democrats are unlikely to try to freeze their Republican counterparts out of the process.\Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.), who along with House Energy and Commerce Chairman John Dingell (D-Mich.) is drafting a cap-and-trade bill that they hope to bring to the House floor this year, said recently that the two of them ""believe a bipartisan measure is essential for a program of this scope and complexity."" \However, Boucher acknowledged that the bill's drafting has been held up by a lack of cooperation by some Republicans on the Energy Committee, who fear the economic impact of adopting a cap-and-trade scheme.\In the runup to the Lieberman-Warner debate, Senate Republicans similarly highlighted economic fears of the bill's price tag, which by some estimates could cost upward of several trillion dollars by 2030 while further exacerbating rising energy costs. \To address those concerns, Boxer last month unveiled a substitute amendment that includes a new $800 billion tax relief fund to help consumers pay higher energy costs expected to result from the bill. The new bill also details trillions of dollars, expected to be raised from auctioning emission allocations, that will be steered to help workers and industry sectors adjust to a new carbon-constrained economy. \However, Republicans are eying the revenue raised by the cap-and-trade program to provide additional tax relief to consumers. Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) last week signaled he will press amendments to return the funds to taxpayers. \""They should be used to lower other taxes for American families rather than increasing the size of government through new programs,"" he said.\Other Republican amendments to the bill will seek to soften its economic impact through cost-containment mechanisms, promote new energy technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and encourage new nuclear power generation.\Possible Democratic amendments could try to tighten the bill's emission-reduction schedule, increase the auctioning of emission allocations and seek a lead role for the United States in international climate talks. Provisions to encourage greenhouse gas reductions in China, India and other developing nations will be a source of contention, too.\The success of such amendments this week will provide a baseline reading on what might be included in a bill taken up next year. While Boxer is on guard for ""poison pill"" amendments to weaken the bill, she said she welcomes an extended debate on a range of issues, adding that it will guide future legislative efforts.\""It's really important for us to get a measure as to where people are,"" she said."
16,"Re: ""Cap-and-trade can help environment, local economy,"" Bob Janes, May 21. Commissioner Janes tries to explain a very confusing issue of an unproven, at best, theory will slow global warming. First, all scientific information shows that for the last 10 years our planet has been cooling. But Commissioner Janes has bought in to the political rhetoric of the likes of Al Gore, whose theories, book and movie have been proven wrong.\Mr. Janes recognizes that there will be an increase in energy rates (a hidden tax,) but says it will be offset with federal assistance money. Just where does he think federal money comes from?\With the present economy and out of control spending by our Congress there is no money for this in the first place. Unless, of course, you raise taxes to get it.\It is on his watch that they want to build a stadium for the Boston Red Sox with county money they don't have. Cap-and-trade is nothing more than tax-and-spend policies that have led to the budget shortfall in Lee County.\ALBERT SENEGETO\Fort Myers\New tax scheme\I was very disturbed by Commissioner Bob Janes' guest opinion supporting cap-and-trade. If he truly believes that cap-and-trade will benefit Lee County and small businesses I have serious doubts about his wisdom.\Global warming caused by human activity is far from a fact and more scientists contest it than support it. This scheme is merely an energy tax and will cost the average citizen and business many thousands of dollars each year. He claims that federal assistance money will offset costs passed down to the consumers. Where does he think the feds will get the money? What strings will be attached to the funds?\Career politicians like him have never made a payroll or struggled to keep a business going. They continue to tax and spend like there is no end in sight. Business people in this community and across the country are waking up to the reality that we must do something to protect our freedom and our children's future from the excesses of our elected officials.\The recent vote in California and the tea parties are a hopeful sign that in the next election we will reverse this march to socialism by cleaning house and defeating candidates like Bob Janes.\ROBERT PEASE\Fort Myers\Check nuclear power\Global warming is a questionable proposition; we actually may be in a period of global cooling. No matter which, it is further questionable as to what contribution to change will be made by Americans destroying our economy in an attempt to abide by some bureaucratic emissions rules from Washington.\Ultimately, the government will be empowered to enforce regulations through penalties, fines and litigation. The cost will be enormous in dollars as well as loss of jobs by every business or activity that consumes fossil fuel or emits CO2. The loss of individual liberty will be even greater. How about me, I breath out CO2, will I be required to breathe less in the name of saving the planet? Or perhaps just declared expendable as a senior citizen?\Commissioner Janes should go back to studying this issue a little deeper than just guessing that cap-and-trade might bring a few jobs to Lee County doing research on wishful thinking technology. Actually the solution is already known - it's called nuclear-generated power, but the socialist enviro-nut cases ignore this.\The sound you hear from overseas is our competitors laughing at us as they crank up their smoky factories.\NEIL MILLER\North Fort Myers\Odd priorities?\I find it irresponsible of Commissioner Judah to be unaware of the garbage problem at Manna Mobile Home Park. According The News-Press' story this is the ""first he has heard about the problem."" Perhaps if he were to physically visit the poorest areas in his district, he would have heard of it before. I don't even live in that area and I'm aware of it.\On the same page of the paper, Mr. Judah shows concern for a shark fishing festival at Fort Myers Beach. The unfortunate impression this gives is that Mr. Judah is concerned for the well-being of swimmers and beachgoers at the relatively affluent Fort Myers Beach area, but not the hungry people living in filth at the mobile home park. Perhaps this is untrue, but if Mr. Judah would pay more attention to the poor and unrepresented, which is part of his job, we wouldn't receive that impression.\Also, how about letting the town of Fort Myers Beach worry about the festival? And if they really do donate the shark meat, then how is it any different than a private citizen catching a shark and filleting it for dinner? As long as they don't go over the legal limit, there shouldn't be a problem anyway.\TOBI CAMPBELL\Fort Myers\You go try a hook\It's ridiculous that so many are celebrating the now ""no-kill"" shark tournament. I'm tired of people patting themselves on the back when they use ""catch and release"" instead of outright killing. Catch and release is nothing more than a form of glorified torture and many times the fish does not survive. Why do so many people enjoy killing and torturing other living creatures? What do you get out of it? Does it make you feel like a big tough person?\Same goes with those who participate in the annual mullet toss on Pine Island. It's embarrassing that this Neanderthal-like behavior still exists in the area. Instead of catch and release, how about leaving the sharks alone and just celebrate the fact that there are still some in existence. Have a coconut toss instead of killing a fish just to use as some sort of sick entertainment. For those of you who will incorrectly suggest that a fish feels no pain (that used to be said about dogs and cats, too), I recommend that you take a large fish hook, ram it through the side of your mouth and then judge whether or not it hurts.\MAMIE HOLST\Fort Myers\Outstanding work\I would like to take this time to commend Officer T. J. McCormick, of the Fort Myers Police Department, for coming to the aid of a family member who was recently in a crisis situation. My son, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia eight years ago, was in unquestionable need of immediate medical attention. This officer was not only proficient in his line of work; he emphatically knew how to handle the situation.\The enormity of compassion and empathy he displayed was tremendous. In light of so much negativity towards the police department, sharing my experience may change the public's perspective of the many fine officers who do assist us in time of need. Once again, thank you, Officer T. J. McCormick. I am forever grateful and recognition should be given to you for your humanitarianism.\CHERYL ZUBRYCKY\Fort Myers"

18," Washington --- A group of senators introduced a resolution Wednesday to block a Bush administration plan that environmentalists say coddles industries responsible for mercury pollution.\ At issue is an Environmental Protection Agency move to install an industry-backed ""cap-and-trade"" plan in which power companies could buy and sell allowances for releasing mercury into the air from coal- burning power plants.\ Alarmed at evidence of fetal brain damage caused when pregnant women are exposed to mercury, more than 600,000 Americans have contacted the EPA in recent years, objecting to plans to set up the pollution-swapping system.\ Although supporters of the Senate resolution acknowledged that it may never pass, the measure has more than enough sponsors --- 32 --- to force a vote by the full Senate.\ An identical resolution was introduced late Wednesday in the House, with five co-sponsors, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California.\ ""It will be an uphill fight, but this is our best opportunity to hold senators accountable on this very important issue,"" said Felice Stadler, a mercury specialist at the National Wildlife Federation.\ Spokesmen for electric power interests that lobbied hard for the cap-and-trade plan ridiculed the resolution.\ Scott Segal, head of a lobbying organization that represents Southern Co. and other coal-burning utilities, called it ""yet another attempt to gum up the works of mercury regulation in the United States.""\ ""Even though the senators argue for faster regulation of mercury emissions, today's petition is a recipe for delay and uncertainty in federal mercury policy, much to the detriment of the American people,"" said Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council.\ Dan Riedinger, spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for the electric power industry, said the stringent regulation anticipated in the Clinton administration declaration would not have held up in court.\ ""Had the agency adhered to this plan as critics of the current rule would have preferred, the resulting regulation would have fallen in the courts like a house of cards in a hurricane,"" he said.\ EPA spokeswoman Eryn Witcher said the resolution ""threatens to delay the world's first mercury regulation on power plants --- a regulation that will cut harmful emissions by 70 percent nationwide.\ ""EPA and the Bush administration continue to feel strongly that we must act now to effectively reduce mercury emissions from power plants,"" she said.\ If passed by both the House and Senate, the resolution would overturn a regulation that the EPA used to rescind a Clinton administration declaration requiring reduction of mercury emissions from coal-burning electric power plants.\ The Senate ""resolution of disapproval"" was introduced Wednesday under the Congressional Review Act, a law passed as part of the Republican Contract with America to give Congress a simple means of vetoing regulations imposed by federal agencies.\ Chief sponsors were Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Susan Collins (R- Maine) and James Jeffords, a Vermont independent. Senators from California, Hawaii, Oregon, Minnesota and other states signed on as co-sponsors.\ Complaining that Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman James Inhofe (R-Okla.) had refused to hold ""a single hearing"" on the EPA mercury rule, Leahy said the administration and Senate Republican leaders had tried ""to avoid any public daylight"" on the matter.\ ""Their aim is to keep the public in the dark, and I would guess that most Americans in fact do not know what EPA and the big polluters have been up to with this rule.""\ Senate rules require a floor vote on the resolution if 30 senators request it.\ CAPTION: KEN CEDENO / Bloomberg News Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) says the Bush administration and Republican leaders are trying ""to keep the public in the dark"" on the mercury emissions plan."
19,"The Obama administration plans to push ahead with efforts to aggressively limit greenhouse gas emissions and fight global warming despite fears that it could further slow the recessionary economy.\Instead of backing away, the administration plans to portray the limits as a boost for America's ""clean energy economy,"" according to congressional leaders and energy experts who have talked with top Obama advisers. The step would spur competitiveness and promote investment in renewable alternatives to imported oil, the government will argue.\At issue is the so-called cap-and-trade initiative, under which the government would set limits on carbon emissions by power plants, factories and other installations but allow those that emit more to buy or trade permits with companies and facilities that emit less than the prescribed limit.\The idea is that raising the cost of pumping more carbon into the atmosphere would encourage companies and other emitters to cut back, thus reducing a principle cause of global warming.\""If we don't put a price on carbon,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, ""we'll never get these clean energy sources online.""\But cap-and-trade would amount to a tax, raising energy costs. And several independent studies have suggested that emissions limits could be a drag on economic growth, a concern raised frequently by opponents of climate change legislation.\""The whole economic issue will be front and center in the debate on this,"" said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, who has discussed President Barack Obama's global warming plans with senior administration officials ""on both sides.""\Polls show voters increasingly losing interest in the global warming issue. By pressing ahead anyway, Obama would be sticking with a program he said during the campaign would be a high priority of his presidency.\""There's a general consensus that things are going to be done with climate"" in Washington this year, said Daniel Yergin, author of the Pulitzer-winning ""The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power,"" who recently updated his book with an epilogue on Obama and energy.\He added: ""We're going to go through a very intense national seminar on cap-and-trade and carbon tax.""\Details of the administration's approach are far from set, though Obama has repeatedly said he favors cap-and-trade. The administration will argue that greenhouse gas restrictions should be part of a two-pronged effort to stimulate renewable energy supplies and ensure demand for the megawatts they'd produce.\The first part is to invest heavily in wind power, solar power and biofuels, through the massive stimulus bill working its way through Congress. The second is to help that power compete with cheaper fossil fuels by pumping up fossil fuels' costs to reflect the potential economic damage from a warmed Earth.\Critics, including many Republicans on Capitol Hill, say those moves will only increase energy prices and hurt already-struggling families.\""I just have concerns on the impact on the economy with all of the issues of global climate change,"" said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), who sits on the Senate's energy and environment committees, ""and what restrictions there's going to be, what expenses there's going to be for American taxpayers.\Economists generally agree that limiting emissions is likely to curb economic growth, at least in the short term. Peter Orszag, the former head of the Congressional Budget Office who now heads the White House Office of Management and Budget, told Congress last year that emissions limits would reduce long-term economic risks but ""also impose costs on the economy ... in the form of higher prices for energy and energy-intensive goods.""\Orszag also testified that the size of those costs could depend on whether the government sells emissions permits, and if so, how it spends the proceeds.\Environmentalists have recently pushed that idea one step further, arguing that if Congress passed emissions caps today, it could borrow against the future revenues from permit sales and spend the money on alternative-energy research and technology.\That would stimulate the economy and ""allow polluters to transition from a high-polluting environment to a low-polluting environment,"" said Andy Stevenson, a former hedge fund manager who is now a finance adviser for the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York.\Other experts are more skeptical. Subsidizing alternative energy could stimulate the economy, said Robert Shapiro, an economic adviser to former President Bill Clinton and now chairman of the U.S. Climate Task Force. But a cap-and-trade system, he said, ""would raise energy prices at a time when you're trying to increase consumption. ... It goes against everything [Obama] campaigned on.\Shapiro and many economists would prefer for the government to tax carbon emissions and refund the proceeds straight to taxpayers. The Democratic leaders working with Obama on climate legislation prefer cap-and-trade. So do a coalition of business leaders -- including Shell oil and the Big Three automakers -- who joined with some environmental groups to release an emissions-limit proposal earlier this month.\Boxer said Friday that she has learned from the defeat of a cap-and-trade bill in the Senate last year. She's set to unveil basic principles of a simpler, more focused plan within a week in hopes of passing a bill by year's end.\Her counterpart on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) talks even more optimistically: He has promised a bill by Memorial Day.\----------\jtankersley@tribune.com\Get green news at one site\Tribune's Green page has news about recycling, jobs and getting eco-friendly at chicagotribune.com/green\Credit: By Jim Tankersley, Washington Bureau"

\
The economic meltdown, energy crisis and global warming are interconnected, and so are the solutions. By implementing the right policies, we can create jobs, secure our energy independence and power capacity, and protect natural resources for our future.
\
But we need a long-term strategy that provides better energy choices by driving investments to build, deliver and install clean energy solutions. We need energy policies that will support both a U.S. auto industry and other manufacturing and that are vibrant, competitive, technologically advanced and an integral part of the solution to global warming.
\
The cap-and-trade legislation will help take a balanced approach toward an economy-wide program that prevents foreign competitors from getting advantages over America companies. The nation should maintain a diverse energy portfolio that includes renewable energy, fossil fuels, nuclear and hydro electric. And solutions must protect individual industries and geographical regions from being disproportionably or adversely affected.
\
Such a strategy is the American Clean Energy &amp; Security Act, which is in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which will help to create millions of new clean-energy jobs, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, encourage the development of cleaner, cheaper sources of energy, and dramatically cut the carbon pollution that causes global warming.
\
The historic changes in the legislation -- also known as the Waxman-Markey bill -- come with risks, and we must work to balance bettering the environment with job creation.
\
The Michigan congressional delegation has been working hard to protect and promote the auto industry, including garnering $50 billion in low-interest loans for automakers to retool their production facilities. U.S. Rep. John Dingell, D-Dearborn, deserves credit for leading the fight to secure 3 percent of the revenue from the auctioning of carbon emission permits, worth an estimated $10 billion to $20 billion over the next 20 years, for the auto industry to develop advanced technology vehicles.
\
Two labor-environmental groups, the Blue Green Alliance and Apollo Alliance, support this legislation.
\
We have seen other examples of trade unions working to both protect jobs and better our environment. Recently, union leaders stood with President Barack Obama when he announced new fuel-economy and tailpipe emission standards. This was truly an historic achievement, bringing together labor, industry, environmentalists and government in support of a comprehensive and consistent national policy.
\
While the resulting standards are aggressive, calling for a 30 percent improvement in fuel efficiency by 2016, they are achievable within the time lines proposed. And they can help to spur a renaissance in the American auto industry, creating new jobs as manufacturers restructure to build the clean energy vehicles of the future.
\
Creating a clean energy economy will be good for Michigan with the potential of thousands of new, well-paying jobs. According to the Michigan Department of Energy, Labor and Economic Development's ""green jobs"" report, from 2005 to 2008, more than 2,500 green jobs were added to Michigan's economy, a growth rate of 7.7 percent.
\
Green jobs also pay well; 13 of the top 15 sectors of green employment have weekly wages above the overall private sector weekly average. The Steel Workers union reminds us that each wind turbine built contain 250 tons of steel and thousands of machined parts.
\
We have an opportunity to rebuild our economy with millions of clean energy jobs, retool manufacturing, increase our energy independence and preserve the planet for future generations. It is time for the leaders in Washington to take the bold, forward-looking action that we need by passing the Waxman-Markey bill.

"
21,"Scientific opinion regarding the primary cause of global climate change is now deeply solidified - temperatures are rising, and human activity is the major contributor to the temperature increases. Congress must now act to address the challenge that climate change poses. \In the near future, the subcommittee I chair will advance for consideration by the House a mandatory control program for greenhouse gases. It will rely on the time-tested cap-and-trade methodology that we employed successfully in 1990 to control sulfur dioxide emissions. My goal in drafting the measure will be to protect\both the environment and the domestic economy. Legislation achieving this necessary balance will be difficult to craft, but it can be done.\There are certain components that will be critical to the formation of the program. It must be mandatory, and it must be economy-wide. It must have a bipartisan foundation and be \industry-supported, similar to each of the preceding major clean air enactments, all of which passed both chambers with large bipartisan majorities. Each CO2-emitting sector must contribute to the solution, and we must ensure that each sector has the tools necessary to do so.\Certain realities must be acknowledged. Our nation's primary source of electricity is our most abundant natural resource - coal. It accounts for 51 percent of electricity generation, with the Department of Energy estimating that coal use will grow to 57 percent in 2030. For the stability of our economy, coal must continue to be the major component of our fuel mix.\Coal is by far the least expensive fuel and we have a 250-year reserve of it in the U.S., the largest of any nation. We have no readily available fuel alternatives. Nuclear plants are being proposed but take years to build. Renewables are cost competitive only in select parts of the country that have an abundance of wind or solar resources. Natural gas is the next least expensive fuel, but we are already importing a significant portion of our daily consumption. If the utilities now burning coal switch to natural gas, the economy would be deeply dislocated. Prices would soar. Gas-dependent industries would suffer, and the 58 percent of homes in America heated with natural gas would experience severe financial distress. This deep economic harm can and must be avoided.\The key to our ability to impose carbon constraints without a radical and economically damaging change in the existing fuel mix is to hasten the development of CO2-capture-and-sequestration technologies. \CO2-capture technologies, such as integrated gasification combined cycle, oxygen-based combustion and retrofits for existing coal-fired plants using chilled ammonia, will soon enter the commercial market. These technologies for CO2 separation will be available in a few years. The technology challenge will be the identification of reliable and available storage caverns for CO2 sequestration. Sites must be thoroughly mapped, pressurized with CO2 and monitored for years to ensure their integrity before they can be certified for commercial use. Under current estimates, that work will not be completed until approximately 2025. \While the injection of carbon dioxide for enhanced oil and gas recovery has occurred for some time, oil and gas fields can accommodate only a small fraction of the billions of tons of CO2 that a cap-and-trade program will necessitate. Many other forms of storage media in diverse locations around the nation must be extensively evaluated, and legal issues surrounding sequestration must be resolved. Last year, a Department of Energy study reported that the U.S. has sufficient geological reserves to accommodate the injection of 900 years of carbon dioxide emissions. But preparing the storage sites will be expensive and will take time. \The recent MIT study ""The Future of Coal"" recommends federal government expenditures of approximately $460 million annually over about the next 10 years in order to bring carbon-capture-and-storage technologies to commercial use. Other estimates of the amount required range upward of $10 billion over the next decade. Appropriations would have to exceed current sums by orders of magnitude to meet these estimates. The preservation of national economic stability requires that any mandatory control program be accompanied by a corresponding financial commitment by government to this technical challenge. \In order to be digestible by our economy, the schedule for emissions reductions should impose the most severe reduction requirements beginning at the time CO2-capture-and-sequestration technologies become widely commercially available. However, significant reductions can be achieved even by coal-burning entities in the early years of the program while the sequestration technologies are being developed. By ensuring that our program includes access to widely available credit offsets, such as domestic agricultural CO2 sinks and verifiable international offsets from tropical rainforest protection, we can offer an affordable means by which emission reductions can be required and achieved in the near term.\In addition to investments in technology and the use of offsets to help facilitate near-term reductions, we must also ensure that the United States and the balance of the developed world are not alone in their efforts to solve this global problem. We must ensure that other nations - notably China and India - also institute greenhouse gas emission control programs or in reliable ways compensate for the CO2 emissions associated with items they export to the United States. Without developing nation participation, the imposition of controls by the United States could have a detrimental effect on our industries that are exposed to global trade. \Several interesting ideas have been proposed for ways in which we can use U.S. trade laws to ensure that our legislation will lead to international participation, such as tying emission credits to each item imported into the United States or establishing manufacturing performance standards for every product exported to our shores. Regardless of the specific approach, our program will contain a mechanism to ensure that we meet the dual goals of decreasing greenhouse gas emissions while protecting domestic entities that participate in energy intensive, globally competitive industries. \A number of other factors will be critical to the development of our program, and there are many details that will be developed as we craft our legislation. As the process moves forward, our goals will be to achieve the scientifically recommended emissions reductions of approximately 60 percent to 80 percent by 2050 while preventing economic disruption. \Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.) is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality."
22,"In just a couple of days, the U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote on a Climate Security Act.\This bill, sponsored by Sens. Joseph Lieberman and John Warner, seeks to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions 63 percent by 2050, according to a fact sheet provided by representatives of the Florida Wildlife Federation and Florida Climate Project.\This would be made affordable by allowing companies to trade and save emission allowances.\That would involve some expense, but there also would be new opportunities for ""green"" enterprises.\More importantly, it would lessen global warming, which otherwise might take a terrible toll on humans and wildlife alike.\Cap and trade is a fancy way of producing a carbon tax. While it has worked well for certain pollutants, Congress might be better served to start this new venture on a trial basis.\The Wall Street Journal suspected in an editorial that it will become just an additional tax and wisely suggested it be used to replace taxes that restrict economic growth.\The goose that laid the golden egg is not the government, but the free enterprise system."
23,"Carbon bleeds out of every pore of our economy. There is no way to finesse the 80 percent emissions reduction that scientists suggest is needed to stave off the worst impacts of climate change. Consumers need clear and consistent price signals on every carbon emitting activity, product and service so that they can properly evaluate their choices. And in this already hyper-turbulent economic environment, producers need stability. They need to know what their costs will be, now and in the future. Cap and trade would require the creation of a huge new and complicated market --- one that is every bit as volatile, murky and subject to manipulation as those that pushed us into this financial quagmire. More economic tricks, gimmicks and derivatives are not going to solve a problem this big. Tax carbon directly if you must. Just get the prices right, and the rest will take care of itself.\Cap and trade programs are a proven way to achieve environmental standards and protect public health while providing flexibility to industries that seek market-based solutions. Utilities successfully used cap and trade to cost-effectively reduce acid rain-causing emissions over the past two decades. A well-structured program provides an equitable way to shift to a low-carbon economy by auctioning a high percentage of pollution credits to generate funds for rebates to energy consumers and technology incentives. If implemented with complementary policies, such as renewable energy and energy efficiency standards, cap and trade could meet pollution-reduction goals while spurring investments in new jobs, increasing energy security and yielding net savings to consumers and businesses. By setting a firm limit on carbon pollution, a cap and trade program can drive clean technology innovation, strengthen America's role as a green-tech leader, and protect Georgia's treasured places.\Federal policymakers are considering a permit-trading system designed to create financial incentives for lowering pollution. It would cap carbon emission levels, allocate permits to businesses and allow low emitters to sell excess permits. Should the federal government create a cap and trade permitting system for greenhouse gas emissions?\YES\Stephen A. Smith, Executive Director, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy\Cap and trade programs are a proven way to achieve environmental standards and protect public health while providing flexibility to industries that seek market-based solutions.

24,"After Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) unseated Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) atop the Energy and Commerce Committee last year, conservative Democrats worried that Waxman and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) would try to ram through a politically toxic climate change bill.\But this week, Waxman and Subcommittee on Energy and Environment Chairman Ed Markey (D-Mass.) showed a pragmatic streak that appears close to lining up support from nearly all the panel's Democratic members.\The pair announced Tuesday night that they had compromised with party moderates to reach a breakthrough on the most difficult issues facing the bill and planned to unveil the text today. \Final details were still being negotiated Wednesday night, and Waxman and Markey met multiple times with Texas Democratic Reps. Gene Green and Charlie Gonzalez to try to cut a deal on limiting the effect on the oil refining industry.\""I'm feeling pretty good right now,"" Markey said Wednesday afternoon. ""It's down on the 10-yard line.""\To be sure, the political calculus for the legislation remains dicey, with action in the Senate uncertain and Republicans unified in opposition.\But the deal appears to have substantially improved chances for quick House action that backers hope will prompt the Senate to act.\""Everybody thought health care was going to happen and energy was just going to sit there,"" a Democratic leadership aide said. ""I think they did what was necessary to earn the trust and respect of the Caucus, and that's a major accomplishment considering the diversity and regional differences.""\Markey said the critics and doubters on the outside weren't aware of the progress being made behind the scenes in recent months.\""Those who were predicting the demise of the bill never understood the dynamic inside our committee,"" Markey said. ""Every Democratic member of the committee is committed to bringing clean energy jobs to their district. ... All of the Members wanted to get to 'yes.'""\Markey predicted that most, if not all, of the Democrats on the committee will sign onto the bill and ultimately be the ambassadors to the rest of the Democratic Caucus as they push to bring it to a House vote this summer.\Waxman and Markey had one thing going for them from the start - strong support from a large coalition of corporations that often oppose environmental legislation, including several major oil companies and utilities.\""When Edison Electric Institute's CEO endorsed the bill, when three of the largest oil companies support the bill, when the second-largest coal company supports the bill, when [General Electric] and dozens of Fortune 100 companies endorse the bill, that will be the answer to the critics who say it will hurt the economy,"" Markey said. \""The hardest thing was to convince people that we could do it, because that's the beginning of real discussions,"" Markey said. ""There were so many people of the opinion that nothing was going to happen until they came into our process. ... We had to dispel conventional wisdom.""\Polling results presented to Democrats on Tuesday night showing strong public support for clean energy legislation that reduces dependence on imported oil also helps the bill's chances, Markey said.\The compromises reached this week also are aimed at minimizing costs for consumers and protecting manufacturers facing the potential for costs not shared by their overseas competitors - two of the biggest criticisms of the scheme.\Instead of the 100 percent auctions that President Barack Obama proposed during his campaign, Waxman and Markey agreed to initially give away most of the carbon emission permits for free in an effort to prevent economic disruptions or a surge in electric rates.\And in negotiations with Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.), Waxman agreed to a 17 percent cut in carbon emissions in 2020, instead of the 20 percent that he had sought, which Boucher, who hails from coal country, had feared would outpace technologies like carbon capture from coal-fired power plants. \The renewable electricity standard was trimmed to 20 percent by 2020, although as much as 8 percent could come from efficiency improvements, Markey said.\Backers of nuclear power, including Science and Technology Chairman Bart Gordon (D-Tenn.), Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), also got commitments for incentives for new nuclear plants as well, including an exemption from the renewable electricity requirements.\Members praised the apparent deal, while cautioning that they wanted to see it on paper before committing to it.\""I think they knew from the beginning that all of this would need to be addressed, and to the chairman's credit, they sat down with us,"" said Rep. Mike Doyle (D-Pa.), who has major steel interests in his district that would get free emissions credits. \""I have to give Mr. Markey a lot of credit,"" said Gonzalez, who praised him in particular for being open to technologies like nuclear power.\Not everybody was wholly satisfied, of course.\Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.) said he was still concerned that there wouldn't be enough revenue raised to insulate lower-income residents from the higher costs the plan would impose.\""The cost of everything is going to go up - electricity, food, plastics, rubber, autos - the cost of everything is going to go up,"" he said.\Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) said he wants language added to tightly regulate the trading of the credits to prevent speculation.\""I'm not for it unless we tighten this market,"" Stupak said. ""I just think there is a windfall for the speculators, and they can't wait."" \Republicans, meanwhile, appear to be hardening their opposition. Energy and Commerce ranking member Joe Barton (R-Texas) promised a fight at next week's markup, saying Republicans would ""never surrender"" on the issue of cap-and-trade, arguing that it is ""unilateral economic disarmament."""
25,"
California's landmark global-warming bill was a white-hot topic in the 2010 governor's race and remains former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's signature environmental achievement.
\
But as the state prepares to unroll the law's cap-and-trade program in November with the first state auctions of emissions permits, a new poll finds that 57 percent of Californians say they have never heard anything about the program.
\
The statewide poll by the Public Policy Institute of California further found that 30 percent of respondents said they had heard ""a little,"" while just 12 percent said they had heard ""a lot.""
\
""Cap-and-trade is a very complicated issue to the average Californian,"" said Mark Baldassare, president and CEO of the PPIC. ""It's not something that has been at the center of attention for them. Connecting the dots between cap-and-trade and global warming continues to be a challenge for policymakers.""
\
The cap-and-trade program sets lower limits on companies' greenhouse gas emissions and allows those who emit less than their cap to sell their unused capacity, in the form of permits, to those who exceed their limits.
\
The issues of climate change and energy policy have been largely absent in the presidential election, which has been dominated by the economy. But those issues remain important to Golden State voters: Seven in 10 likely voters in California say the candidates' positions on global warming and energy policy are important in determining their vote, according to the new poll. Thirty percent said the issue is very important, while 42 percent said it's somewhat important.
\
By a 54 to 33 percent, majorities of likely voters say they trust President Barack Obama more than Republican challenger Mitt Romney to handle global warming and energy policy. But among the 1,131 likely voters surveyed on the question of overall preference for president, Obama's margin over Romney was only 11 percentage points: 51 to 40 percent. That's far tighter than four years ago, when Obama carried California by a stunning 24 points.
\
But likely voters' preference for Obama on global warming and energy policy does not translate to support for his overall handling of environmental issues. Likely voters are split, with 46 percent approving and 46 percent disapproving of his handling of environmental issues.
\
""California voters have high standards when it comes to the environment,"" Baldassare said. ""They trust Obama more than Romney, but they don't feel Obama has done enough. A lot of enthusiasm for Obama has faded, particularly in the environmental arena.""
\
Asked to assess what government is doing to address global warming, 53 percent of likely voters say the federal government is not doing enough, while 23 percent say it is doing just enough; 21 percent say it is doing more than enough.
\
Nearly 8 in 10 Californians believe the world's temperature has been going up over the past 100 years, and 45 percent consider global warming a very serious threat to California's future.
\
A political battle is brewing in Sacramento over how the state, which expects to generate anywhere from $2 billion to $14 billion annually in new revenues from the permit auctions, will spend the money.
\
The PPIC poll found that 65 percent of Californians have very little or no confidence in the state to spend that money wisely.
\
Some members of the administration of Gov. Jerry Brown and the California High-Speed Rail Authority would like to use the revenue to make up for expected shortfalls in the $63 billion bullet-train project. The train, which would link San Francisco and Los Angeles, recently got the green light from the Legislature and Brown.
\
The Public Policy Institute of California surveyed 2,500 adults from July 10-24. The overall margin of error is plus or minus 2.9 percentage points, and 3.6 percentage points for just the 1,131 likely voters.

26,"Candidates for the 1st District congressional seat responded Sunday to a broad range of questions on environmental sustainability, ranging from global warming and alternative transportation to how highly they regard the environment.\Democrat Chellie Pingree and Republican Charlie Summers answered questions posed by moderator Irwin Gratz, host of Maine Public Radio's ""Morning Edition."" The forum was held in the library of the University of Southern Maine in Portland.\Questions were determined by forum sponsors - a group of Maine-based organizations concerned about the environment.\Both candidates said protecting Maine's environment would be a top priority if they are elected to Congress.\""I can't think of anything that would be a higher priority for me,"" Summers said.

27,"Who is responsible for maintaining and improving our environment? The answer, of course, is: We are. That's why the April 19 editorial, ""Cap-and-trade system is really a tax,"" by Hillsdale College Economics and Public Policy Professor Gary Wolfram, Ph.D., was surprising and difficult to understand.\Dr. Wolfram argues that the cap-and-trade system should be shelved because we are unable to measure the environmental cost per ton of carbon dioxide emission in comparison to the benefits we receive from fossil fuel-produced goods. This is like firemen not fighting fires because we haven't measured the property values of the structures in comparison to firefighting costs. In fighting fires, we use our taxes to pay the costs and take action. We accept our responsibility.\Alarms have sounded in recent years because atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and global temperatures are at record highs. Natural phenomenon, some beyond our control, can be the cause. The strong consensus among scientists, however, is that high CO2 levels, produced by human activity and over which we do have some control, are the cause of today's warming. We must reduce emissions. This is our responsibility. Consequences of inaction will be far greater than cap-and-trade system costs.\Glaciers worldwide are receding. Concern has been expressed that receding Himalayan glaciers will someday halt the water supply to major rivers in India and China. Economic and human impact would be devastating. The cost of a cap-and-trade system today, taking action now, assuming our responsibility to ourselves and to our planet, would not compare to the costs of such a disaster.\Increased ocean water acidity is another recent observation. Some absorbed CO2 is converted to carbonic acid. Shells collected today are significantly thinner than those measured in museum collections. Acidity, along with increased ocean water temperature, is the cause of observed coral bleaching. Some divers claim that action is unneeded because many reefs have never looked better. This is like the firemen saying not to worry about the fire in the kitchen since the living room looks great.\Dr. Wolfram points out that oil and natural gas companies and electric utilities will feel the greatest impact of a cap-and-trade system. Isn't this just as it should be? Action is going to require money. These companies, recording huge profits, are exactly where responsibility belongs. Incentives for alternative technologies and developments that reduce both emissions and costs are created. New jobs and employment opportunity will follow in the process. Cap-and-trade will stimulate economic growth.\Dr. Wolfram also points out that action to reduce emissions need not be taken because our improvements will be overwhelmed by emissions from China. This is like saying that we don't need to fight forest fires in Colorado because fires are going to be worse in Idaho. Also, we abdicate our leadership role, lose research and development opportunity and, through inaction, discard our voice for an improved environment.\Dr. Wolfram's editorial, ""Cap-and-trade system is really a tax,"" makes no reference to environmental responsibility. This is surprising and difficult to understand. Cap-and-trade is really an investment.\Robert Learner of Battle Creek is retired director of Kingman Museum of Natural History."
28,"In the 1960s, a University of Wisconsin graduate student named Thomas Crocker came up with a novel solution for environmental problems: cap emissions of pollutants and then let firms trade permits that allow them to pollute within those limits.\Now legislation using cap-and-trade to limit greenhouse gases is working its way through Congress and could become the law of the land. But Mr. Crocker and other pioneers of the concept are doubtful about its chances of success. They aren't abandoning efforts to curb emissions. But they are tiptoeing away from an idea they devised decades ago, doubting it can work on the grand scale now envisioned.\""I'm skeptical that cap-and-trade is the most effective way to go about regulating carbon,"" says Mr. Crocker, 73 years old, a retired economist in Centennial, Wyo. He says he prefers an outright tax on emissions because it would be easier to enforce and provide needed flexibility to deal with the problem.\The House has passed cap-and-trade legislation. The Senate could take up a measure in September. But Republicans strongly oppose the idea -- arguing that it is a tax that will hurt the economy -- and Democrats are struggling to come up with an approach that apportions the inevitable cost of a cap-and-trade system among different interests, from consumers to utilities to coal plants.\Mr. Crocker, who went on to become a professor at the University of Wyoming, is one of two economists who dreamed up cap-and-trade in the 1960s. The other, John Dales, who died in 2007, was also a skeptic of using the idea to tame global warning.\""It isn't a cure-all for everything,"" Mr. Dales said in an interview in 2001. ""There are lots of situations that don't apply.""\Mr. Crocker sees two modern-day problems in using a cap-and-trade system to address the global greenhouse-gas issue. The first is that carbon emissions are a global problem with myriad sources. Cap-and-trade, he says, is better suited for discrete, local pollution problems. ""It is not clear to me how you would enforce a permit system internationally,"" he says. ""There are no institutions right now that have that power.""\Europe has embraced cap-and-trade rules. Emissions initially rose there because industries were given more permits than they needed, and regulators have since tightened the caps. Meanwhile China, India and other developing markets are reluctant to go along, fearing limits would curb their growth. If they don't participate, there is little assurance that global carbon emissions will slow much even if the U.S. goes forward with its own plan. And even if everyone signs up, Mr. Crocker says, it isn't clear the limits will be properly enforced across nations and industries.\The other problem, Mr. Crocker says, is that quantifying the economic damage of climate change -- from floods to failing crops -- is fraught with uncertainty. One estimate puts it at anywhere between 5% and 20% of global gross domestic product. Without knowing how costly climate change is, nobody knows how tight a grip to put on emissions.\In this case, he says Washington needs to come up with an approach that will be flexible and easy to adjust over a long stretch of time as more becomes known about damages from greenhouse-gas emissions. Mr. Crocker says cap-and-trade is better suited for problems where the damages are clear -- like acid rain in the 1990s -- and a hard limit is needed quickly.\""Once a cap is in place,"" he warns, ""it is very difficult to adjust."" For example, buyers of emissions permits would see their value reduced if the government decided in the future to loosen the caps.\Joseph Aldy, a White House adviser on the environment, calls the argument a ""straw man,"" saying a market-based cap is being designed with built-in flexibility. For example, a price ceiling on carbon allowances could prevent the program from becoming too big a burden on households and businesses and a floor would prevent a big loss in the value of permits. And unlike a tax, he says, a cap ensures carbon reduction.\Pollution has been a puzzle for economists for decades. In the early 1900s, a British economist named Arthur Pigou proposed taxes on polluters. Ronald Coase, a University of Chicago economist, won a Nobel Prize for his 1960 book, ""The Problem of Social Cost,"" which showed how market economics could address pollution problems.\In 1966, Mr. Crocker, still struggling to finish his thesis at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, sketched out the cap-and-trade idea to deal with air pollution produced by fertilizer plants in Florida. Mr. Crocker first pitched the idea of trading at a conference in Washington. He had been asked to attend as a stand-in for a professor who couldn't go and present data on the Florida plants. He didn't have all the data yet and came up with the theory instead.\Working separately, Mr. Dales in 1968 published a book called, ""Pollution, Property and Prices,"" which used the same approach for farmers who were polluting Canadian lakes and streams.\Their logic went like this: When governments capped smog emissions from power plants or the runoff of pesticides by farmers into local streams, it was indirectly putting a value on these emissions. Some farmers and some power plants could reduce these emissions more efficiently than others, and some placed a higher value on them than others. By setting caps on pollution but then allowing the polluters to trade these rights, the economists theorized, the polluters themselves would figure out the cheapest way to meet new targets.\Another economist, David Montgomery, advanced their ideas in the 1970s, converting their theories into the complex mathematical formulas to demonstrate that they weren't merely an idea but were also economically feasible. Mr. Montgomery, too, is a skeptic of cap-and-trade for greenhouse gases. He prefers an outright tax.\""You get huge swings in carbon prices with a cap, which creates more volatility and uncertainty for business,"" he says.\Cap-and-trade got a big boost in 1990, when President George H.W. Bush signed amendments to the Clean Air Act that imposed new limits on emissions of sulfur dioxide, which produces acid rain. Economists said the move let producers save billions of dollars and still hit their targets.\Still, Messrs. Dales and Crocker never got much personal mileage out of the idea. Mr. Crocker says he had such a hard time getting funding to further his research on the subject that he moved on to other matters. So far, he has stayed on the sidelines in the debate about cap-and-trade.\Credit: By Jon Hilsenrath"
29,"When I was California Assembly Speaker in 2006, I proudly negotiated with Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to lay down a marker in the fight against climate change by placing strict reductions on greenhouse gas emissions through Assembly Bill 32.\We knew we had to do something, especially after the U.S. pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol.\AB 32 gave the California Air Resources Board the ability to create a system in which polluters had to pay if they were unable to directly reduce their emissions. This first-ever cap-and-trade system has become instrumental to California's economy.\Payments by polluters generate much-needed funds to clean up our environment and make California the leader in renewable energy that it is today.\California has made great strides with investments from our cap-and-trade revenue, including massive efforts to get more electric vehicles on our roads and improving the environment of our poorest communities, all while reducing our greenhouse gas emissions at a historic rate.\Unfortunately, some of this important progress may be threatened by diversions of cap-and-trade funds for investments that are barely related to the original intent of AB 32.\The last thing our state and the planet can afford is for cap-and-trade funds to be turned into a slush fund for pet projects that do little or nothing to improve our environment.\Over the years, we have seen standards weakened on the original cap-and-trade deal as it relates to what qualifies for appropriate spending of these dollars and there are now efforts underway to even further destabilize this critically important funding source, and it is causing great alarm for those of us who fought so hard for this program.\By allowing these funds to be used on unrelated projects we will never meet our greenhouse gas reduction goals or truly address the devastating impacts of climate change.\Clean drinking water, high-speed rail, and workforce training are critical to California's future. But it is more appropriate to invest in these areas from the state's general fund and not from the cap-and-trade revenue.\I urge the Legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom to not allow diversions to continue, and to be the environmental stewards they have been throughout their political careers.\California has led the fight on climate change. We are now seeing much of the rest of the country follow. All of the top Democratic presidential candidates are making the fight against climate change a cornerstone of their campaigns.\Our cap-and-trade system is our strongest tool in fixing this existential threat. We must not let it rust away in the toolbox. It is imperative that we not cheapen the world-class program we all worked so hard to create over a decade ago.\Fabian Núñez is former California Assembly Speaker and co-author of AB 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act, fnunez@mercuryllc.com.

30,"The entirely theoretical argument presented by Richard Sexton and Steve Sexton (""The Fatal Flaw in California's Cap-and-Trade Program
,"" Cross Country, Oct. 21) falls short in just one place: the real world. The facts show that under California's law to limit climate pollution, our economy is thriving, jobs are being added at a faster rate than the national average and emissions are decreasing ahead of schedule.\The authors complain about a potential problem with some cap-and-trade systems: the risk of emissions and economic leakage, while also decrying one of the solutions, allocating free allowances to trade-exposed industries in proportion to their output. This ensures that producers aren't penalized for making more goods, and producers who make more goods with fewer emissions are rewarded. Total emissions are still limited by the cap.\There's a good reason that the authors limit their case to hypotheticals. Five years into cap and trade, there is no actual evidence that leakage is a concern. In contrast, there's plenty of evidence that the cap-and-trade program is doing exactly what it's intended to do: help the state cut carbon pollution and continue to lead the world on climate action.\Quentin Foster\Environmental Defense Fund\Sacramento, Calif.\The real flaw is the goal in the first place, never mind the solution. California's real impact on the environment will never come from being a carbon-neutral state. It comes from its example to the world of high environmental standards while still being one of the world's largest economies. But one has to wonder how much longer other states and countries will look to California's leadership when they see the sky-high cost of living and middle-class jobs leaving the state. The governor should focus on that first, and the rest of his goals will follow.\Tom Mysz\Oakland, Calif.\The authors believe that California's cap-and-trade program is flawed because it does nothing to reduce pollution. But it created another state agency, which means more government and higher taxes. It also hurts business. Mission accomplished.\James Elliott\Doral, Fla."
31,"""We feel like we're the guys in the Alamo and the reinforcements actually did arrive.""\Rep. Carl Wilson, R-Grants Pass, said of the conservative,\mostly rural Oregonians arriving in Salem for the rally\In the early morning hours Thursday, hundreds of truckers from across Oregon formed a multi-city convoy and joined hundreds more outside the Capitol building to rally against a controversial carbon emissions cap-and-trade bill.\At least 2,000 people filled the Capitol steps and mall.\Truckers came from as far away as La Grande and Coos Bay and Medford — some beginning their treks just after midnight.\If passed, Senate Bill 1530 would impose a sweeping, economy-wide cap on carbon emissions and charge the state's largest polluters for emissions over the cap.\Democrats control the Oregon House, Senate and Governor's Office, leaving many Republicans feeling under siege. Republican lawmakers attending the rally expressed support and gratefulness for the protesters.\""We feel like we're the guys in the Alamo and the reinforcements actually did arrive,"" Rep. Carl Wilson, R-Grants Pass, said of the conservative, mostly rural Oregonians arriving in Salem for the rally.\In the summer of 2019, a walkout by Senate Republicans and a protest by the group Timber Unity — the group also behind Thursday's rally — proceeded the death of last year's carbon cap-and-trade bill.\Those protesting Thursday said the 2020 bill would destroy their communities, livelihoods and careers. They urged lawmakers to put the issue before the voters instead of pushing it through the Legislature.\The Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources started taking public testimony on the bill at 3 p.m. The hearing room was packed with onlookers and overflow areas started getting crowded as well.\More than twice as many people signed up to testify against the bill as those who signed up in support.\During the rally, Jeff Leavy, one of the founders of Timber Unity, ripped up a copy of the proposed bill in front of the crowd. ""We are under fire, and they are coming for us,"" he said.\Another speaker led the crowd in a chant, demanding: ""Let us vote!""\Semi-trucks, tractors, logging trucks and farming equipment snaked around the Capitol building, slowing nearby traffic to a crawl. The hum of the engines and blasts from their horns punctuated the sound of country music and C.W. McCall's ""Convoy.""\Earlier in the day, the influx of trucks on Interstate 5 and routes leading to the Capitol and meet-up spots at the Oregon State Fairgrounds caused delays during rush hour.\A volunteer manning a registration booth estimated about 2,500 were in attendance by 10 a.m. Buses carrying participants who parked their trucks at nearby fairgrounds continued to stream in well into the morning.\Timber Unity officials estimated about 1,100 trucks joined the convoy and rally.\The rally had only been going for a few hours when tensions spilled over during a 9:30 a.m. meeting of the Senate Housing and Development Committee.\Sen. Dallas Heard, R-Roseburg, was preparing to testify on a bill he is sponsoring.\Committee chair Sen. Shemia Fagan, D-Portland, began the hearing by saying that the ""chaos"" at the Capitol — referring to the trucks and noise outside — prevented the committee from starting on time so witnesses would need to limit their testimony to three minutes.\Speaking to two women who'd come to testify, Fagan said, ""It's frustrating when people try to shut down the Capitol. It makes it where folks like you, that came to be heard, don't get to be heard all the time. So, on behalf of Oregon State Capitol, (I) apologize for the chaos this morning. So, with that, Senator Heard.""\""All right then,"" said committee member Sen. Denyc Boles, R-Salem, as she stormed out of the committee.\""Wow,"" Heard said. Right then, a particularly deep truck horn blared and Heard leaned back in his chair, allowing the sound to fill the room.\""Your three minutes are going; would you like to testify?"" Fagan asked.\Heard shook his head. ""Nope."" He collected his things and stood.\""There's no respect in this building. That does not apply to you or you,"" he said, pointing to the other remaining committee members, Sen. Rob Wagner, D-Lake Oswego, and Sen. Jeff Golden, D-Ashland.\""I guess there are no proponents for the bill,"" Fagan said, proceeding to call up a panel of opponents.\Heard crossed the room to get the rest of his paperwork. ""I don't believe the First Amendment only applies to one party,"" he said.\""You are the government, Sen. Heard,"" Fagan replied as Heard left.\The bill, Senate Bill 1555, would ""authorize development of certain parsonages on lots or parcels with places of worship either existing or being developed.""\At the end of the short hearing, Fagan said it would be hard to consider moving the bill forward because no one had testified in support.\A convoy of trucks surrounded the Capitol building. Some sported the American flag, the State of Oregon flag or Trump 2020 banners.\A crowd of several hundred rallied on the steps of the building. Families pushed strollers, people walked dogs and volunteers in neon vests registered voters. Their conversations were frequently drowned out by the honking of horns.\Dozens of families joined the rally. Evelyn Wakimoto, of Beaverton, manned a booth passing out veggie straws, organic popcorn and applesauce.\""I'm here to show my daughter how important it is to stand up for your human rights,"" she said, pulling in her 4-year-old daughter for a hug.\She chatted with other parents, kids in tow, about how the proposed bill would make the price of everything from groceries to toilet paper go up.\The issue is personal for her. Her dad contracts with the postal service to deliver mail. Her great-grandfather was a trucker.\""It's in our blood,"" Wakimoto said.\She said the bill would cause her father's company to shut down. An issue with such a monumental impact should go to the voters, she said.\Those trekking in from Lebanon said they woke up at 4 a.m. to join the convoy.\Phyllis Kerby, of Dallas, said she was lucky enough to have the morning off. She stood talking in the cold at dawn with Keith Kennedy, of Lebanon. Both were concerned with how the bill would affect their ability to work.\""I wouldn't be able to do what I love anymore,"" Kerby said.\Some who didn't have the day off were given paid time off to attend the rally.\""They're big supporters of this,"" said Arlyn Dunn, of Lyons, of his employer, Freres Lumber Co.\He and his fellow drivers talked about the impact the proposed cap-and-trade legislation would have on their livelihoods.\The rising fuel costs and stricter equipment standards will take their toll on mom-and-pop businesses, families and working Oregonians, said John Lotze, of Stayton. They want the issue taken to voters.\""It would get voted right out the door,"" he said.\A similar truck protest organized last year by Timber Unity caused lengthy delays in the city and on area highways as loggers, truckers and farmers congregated in Salem to speak out against statewide caps on carbon emissions.\Angelita Sanchez, a Sweet Home trucking company owner and secretary of Timber Unity's board of directors, said this year's rally is more organized than last year's.\The 2019 protest also occurred during the busy season and was quickly organized.\In contrast, Timber Unity has been planning this rally for months, and it comes during a slow time for many farmers, loggers and construction workers.\""I really hope legislators are inspired by the sheer volume of people from across Oregon who are going to show up tomorrow to share their concerns about the cap-and-trade tax,"" said Todd Stoffel, Vice President, Timber Unity Association. ""They're coming off their farms, out of the forests, and driving from hundreds of miles away to put a face to the impact that lawmakers will have if they don't listen to those of us affected by the policy agendas of special interests.""\Maybe lawmakers will be inspired to set aside their concerns about their own reelection and ""do what's right for the people of Oregon,"" Stoffel added.\Timber Unity officials said they are against the cap-and-trade bill and what members see as abuse of the short legislative session by Democrats.\Those involved instead want to take the issue to voters.\A litany of lawmakers, including Rep. Bill Post, R-Keizer, Sen. Herman E. Baertschiger Jr., R-Grants Pass, and Sen. Kim Thatcher, R-Keizer, spoke at the rally.\During her speech, Thatcher announced she will run for Oregon Secretary of State, making her the first Republican in the race.\Timber Unity leaders presented several lawmakers with ""Courage and Conviction"" awards for speaking out against the cap-and-trade bill.\This year the legislation, SB1530, has been amended to, among other things, phase in carbon fees on transportation fuel on a geographic basis, starting in the Portland area. More amendments are expected.\But some Republicans still object and want the issue referred to voters. They threatened another walkout if the bill went forward any other way.\Opposition doesn't just come from Republicans. After being given the ""Courage and Conviction"" award, Sen. Betsy Johnson, D-Scappoose, spoke out against both iterations of the cap-and-trade bill.\""This was a bad bill last session,"" the Democrat said to a round of applause and cheers. ""It's a bad bill this session.""\Timber Unity leaders also met with Gov. Kate Brown Thursday morning during the rally.\That same day, Renew Oregon, an environment advocacy coalition, held a news conference in Portland featuring youth from across the state who declared a climate emergency.\Spokesman Brad Reed said the group's rural supporters in the timber and farming industries plan to speak at Thursday's public hearing on the bill.\A pro-climate action rally is also scheduled for Tuesday, Feb. 11. at the Capitol. Reed said turnout is expected to surpass the 800 people who attended their rally last year.\Meanwhile, the Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources will take additional public testimony on SB1530 from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday.\All of the hearings will be held in Hearing Room C at the Capitol.

This fall, Congress faces a major economic and environmental decision that will affect the lives of all Americans: what to do about climate change. While some Americans question whether global warming is threatening our future, many federal legislators agree it must be addressed. How to do that is the multibillion-dollar question.
\
Congress' answer is to create a cap-and-trade market. Under this approach, the government caps the amount of carbon dioxide companies can emit. The government then auctions or gives away ""emission allowances"" -- each allowance being the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide. Experts estimate these auctions could amount to more than $100 billion annually. Companies could then trade allowances on a ""carbon market"" open to everyone, including Wall Street players.
\
As a not-for-profit public power utility, we have a huge stake in this debate. Since our mandate is to provide reliable, reasonably priced electric service, while protecting the environment, the cost of climate change legislation is immensely important to us. Unlike investor-owned utilities, we can't absorb new cap-and-trade costs by trimming profit margins or reducing shareholder dividends. Especially in tough economic times, customers don't want us passing on additional costs or sacrificing service.
\
This month, the U.S. Senate debates the American Clean Energy and Security Act (HR2454), a cap-and-trade bill that passed the U.S. House in June. The bill has shortcomings that could result in costs harmful to consumers, the economy and the reliability of our electric system, without providing any environmental benefit.
\
If Congress addresses climate change with a new multibillion-dollar market, they need to get it right.
\
The most important thing the Senate can do is place a ceiling on carbon allowance prices to ensure a cap-and-trade market does not result in runaway prices. Some want a ceiling and a floor to keep prices high enough to motivate changes in behavior without harming our economy. Since HR2454 also contains mandatory reduction targets, emission reductions will occur. But prices must be capped to avoid volatility and limit risk to electricity customers.
\
Any cap-and-trade legislation should also allocate (not auction) emission allowances at no cost to public power and other local distribution utilities so they can pass their value directly to customers. Whether allowances are auctioned or allocated, the emissions cap means greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced. Competitive auctioning allowances would just increase prices.
\
To ensure unregulated generators do not receive windfall profits at the expense of consumers, allowances should be given only to local distribution utilities that directly serve retail customers. These entities are regulated by state and local governments that will require the value of allowances be passed on to customers. Unregulated ""merchant"" generators face no such restrictions and will likely pass that value on to their shareholders. The House climate change bill would allocate up to 10 percent of emission allowances for the electricity industry to merchant generators.
\
If lawmakers want to reduce greenhouse gas, community-owned power groups are asking our leaders to pass laws that are both fair and affordable. Current legislation falls woefully short of this goal. We urge citizens join us in asking Sen. Orrin Hatch (202-224-5251) and Sen. Bob Bennett (202-224-5444) for a law that balances the needs of consumers, our economy and our environment.

Climate change, including its root causes and possible solutions, is an issue that is being hotly debated right now at universities, in the media and in the Legislature.
\
To date, the Springfield Utility Board intentionally has stepped away from the debate. As a consumer-owned utility, we respect our customers' diversity of opinions on the matter.
\
Instead, we are focused on making informed policy decisions that provide our customers with cost-effective energy and water solutions now and in the future. This includes being mindful of the impact to the environment, a goal that has been unchanged for decades.
\
But the rapidly changing regulatory environment has highlighted the need to focus on the next generation of energy sources. While looking to the future, we can learn from the past.
\
Springfield Utility Board and other consumer-owned utilities have a long history of investing in renewable energy. As customers of the Bonneville Power Administration and with BPA's power being from predominantly hydroelectric generation, consumer-owned utilities have resources that are more than 92 percent greenhouse-gas free. Compared to the nation, which on average has a power portfolio that is only 26 percent greenhouse-gas free, local utilities have led by example.
\
SUB has been a customer of BPA for more than 50 years. We have invested in energy and water conservation measures in the effort to reduce customers' bills while helping minimize the impact on the environment.
\
Turning to the regulatory environment, it is extremely dynamic right now - unusually so compared to the past. SUB and other utilities are constantly reviewing regulatory proposals at the state and federal level. It is not unusual for them to conflict.
\
SUB's participation in the process is intended to ground theoretical ideas to practical solutions. While our underlying goals remain unchanged, how we respond to particular regulatory proposals depends on how they mesh with other proposals.
\
Sometimes they fit. Often times they don't.
\
We also don't want to have unintended consequences. For example - let's look at carbon cap and trade.
\
Carbon cap and trade is a mechanism where carbon credits (or fossil fuel emissions credits) could be traded. On day one, utilities would be given a limited, fixed allocation of credits that they could use to apply to new or existing generation or, if they have excess credits, sell credits to other entities.
\
Sounds workable. However, an unbounded trading structure could result in speculators buying large amounts of these finite credits. By cornering the market, speculators could set the price - driving up the cost of credits and the cost of generation, and creating an artificial economic stranglehold.
\
Does SUB support the environment? Absolutely. Would we support a structure that would allow speculators to hold us hostage in the name of the environment? SUB believes that making the environment into a commodity would ultimately backfire, turning something precious into pork bellies. The environment shouldn't be associated with Enron (which manipulated the power markets in the recent past).
\
SUB continues to strive for thoughtful solutions.
\
Through cooperation with other utilities, we supported Oregon's Renewable Portfolio Standard, which requires utilities meet certain benchmarks for their renewable energy supplies. We're engaged in the Western Climate Initiative, which could establish carbon cap and trade for Western states. We currently have utility policies that exceed state requirements related to promotion of renewables. Commercial, industrial and residential conservation remains strong.
\
We look forward to working with our customers and other utilities to build on our successes, and SUB greatly appreciates the strong support of our customers in protecting the environment.

34,"In what are likely to be blueprints for a national effort to fight climate change, clusters of states on the East and West Coasts and in the Midwest are setting up marketplaces for electric utilities and other companies to buy and sell credits to emit carbon dioxide and other gases responsible for global warming.\Building on a voluntary market system pioneered in Chicago, 10 Northeastern states recently launched what they are billing as the biggest, most coordinated effort yet in the U.S. to take on climate change by mandating that electric utilities take part in an emissions-allowance trading program.\But an alliance of seven Western states and four Canadian provinces could surpass their efforts with a more ambitious trading system they unveiled last month. It encompasses industry as well as utilities, with a goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent in 12 years.\And a consortium of six Midwestern states, including Illinois and Wisconsin, and one Canadian province are establishing their own carbon-trading market, aiming to have it running in 2010.\These programs embrace the ""cap-and-trade"" approach that has the support of both the Democratic and GOP presidential nominees. Proponents say it offers an effective way to cut the emissions blamed for warming the climate, and to do so cheaply and more efficiently than a regulatory program.\The results for consumers are unclear. Although cutting carbon dioxide emissions is predicted to raise electric rates, cap-and-trade may mean the cost will be less than conventional regulations, and in many states some of the proceeds from the sales of emissions allowances will be spent on promoting energy efficiency and conservation, saving households money on their electric bills.\Whatever the eventual impact on household budgets, the first auction of emissions allowances at the New York Mercantile Exchange last month represented the opening of a new chapter in America's response to the threat of climate change caused by the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere.\""The start of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative auction of emission allowances demonstrates both how far we've come and how far we need to go to effectively address climate change,"" said Eileen Claussen, head of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, referring to the effort by the Northeastern states. ""These states are paving the path to a comprehensive national program that offers the most cost-effective solution to significantly reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.""\Emissions trading started in the 1990s with efforts to reduce sulfur dioxide, the cause of acid rain. When that proved successful at cutting emissions quickly for much less than the cost of a conventional regulatory program, the cap-and-trade approach came to be seen as a way to tackle the bigger problem of global warming.\Chicago's Richard Sandor, credited with creating a host of financial futures markets at the Chicago Board of Trade, established the first full-fledged carbon market, the Chicago Climate Exchange, in 2003. A voluntary trading system, the exchange has a membership of 300 companies and organizations.\""We continue to be very positive on the growth of worldwide emissions markets, despite the current economic situation,"" said Sandor, who also oversees a Chicago-based futures market for carbon credits and a European climate exchange.\Indeed, with presidential candidates Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) favoring a cap-and-trade system, it's likely that a national trading program will be set up, after years of little action on the federal level, to combat global warming.\""There are differences between the two candidates on climate,"" said Harvard University's Robert Stavins, a specialist in environmental economics. ""However, what's most striking is that if the difference between the two candidates is 1 foot, then both of them have a distance of about 1 mile from the current administration.""\The cap-and-trade approach can have pitfalls. When European countries set up carbon trading in 2005, they not only issued the credits for free, they gave away too many. That led to huge profits for some companies.\The Northeastern states have been criticized for setting too generous a cap -- 188 million tons annually -- for the first several years of their program. Emissions have fallen below that level in recent years because of rising fuel prices and a slowing economy.\But Jonathan Schrag, executive director of the regional initiative, noted that during the first auction, the allowances fetched $3.07 each, well above the $1.86 floor price the states had set. And although only 12.6 million allowances were sold -- covering an equal number of tons of carbon dioxide emissions -- the states received bids for four times that many allowances, a sign that utilities recognize the value of the trading process.\""I think we have set the bar very high for a model that could easily be adapted for a national program,"" said Pete Grannis, commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.\But Harvard's Stavins noted that the Northeastern states require only power plants to take part in the cap-and-trade program. The Western Climate Initiative, which includes California, will take in a much broader array of sources, including industry and transportation.\Although still in the planning stage, the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord, of which Illinois is a member, will include a variety of sources, said accord chief Jesse Heier.\""It makes more sense, we thought, to look at the whole range of sources,"" Heier said. ""We didn't think it was right to pick just one and go after it. Emissions really know no borders.""\- - -\How a cap-and-trade system works\The concept is that some power plants and businesses can reduce emissions more easily than others for a host of reasons, such as having newer facilities, different fuel supplies or more flexible generating or manufacturing processes.\By issuing a set number of credits, states give those utilities and manufacturers an incentive to reduce their emissions quickly so they will have leftover allowances to sell to companies that cannot adjust as cheaply or quickly.\But because the overall number of credits gradually declines, total emissions fall.\The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative has set a limit of 188 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year for the 233 power plants in the 10 Northeastern states it covers. The group has begun auctioning emission allowances totaling 188 million tons.\Utilities must have allowances to cover their emissions, either by buying them through the auction, buying them from someone else (such as another utility or a broker) or by reducing their emissions. And they can sell any allowances they don't need, giving them an incentive to reduce their emissions.\The ""cap"" will remain at 188million tons through 2014. After that it will decline by 2.5 percent a year, yielding a 10 percent reduction by 2018. The money that the group raises through the auction of allowances will be distributed to the member states, many of which are using it to promote energy efficiency, conservation and alternative energy sources.\----------\soswanson@tribune.com\Get more on the environment\To learn about living green and efforts being made by other cities, go to chicagotribune.com/green\Credit: By Stevenson Swanson, Tribune correspondent"
35,"Cap-and-trade could be the best tool to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to help conquer global climate change. It also could promote industrial innovation and help clean up the environment in Lee County and nationwide.\Here in Lee County, county commissioners are looking to breathe new life into Lee County's business community by encouraging cap-and-trade programs that will promote new green businesses and ideas.\Lee County businesses already are working on alternative energy (solar) and fuels (cooking oil and jatropha for county vehicles), and a few consultants are looking to greener transportation issues and solutions, such as the one-way tolling system in Cape Coral, which helps to reduce car emissions.\But we can do more. Cap-and-trade could be one of the solutions to turn around Lee County's economy.\Here's how it works: a cap-and-trade system sets a ""cap"" -- or limit -- on industry emissions and distributes ""rights"" to emit greenhouse gases, called allowances.\Industries are regulated up to the level of the cap. If a company reduces its emissions below its cap, it can receive pollution credits it can sell, ""trade,"" or transfer to other firms that are unable to meet the cap requirements.\Companies do not have individual caps, and must ensure that they acquire a sufficient quantity of allowances to cover their emissions in any given compliance period. Allowances and reductions are kept under the cap. The cap is condensed over time, further reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions and helping the environment. The goal is to slow global warming.\Cap-and-trade has recently emerged as a tool for addressing greenhouse gas emissions, but it also has a successful financial and environmental history.\In the early 1990s, high levels of sulphur dioxide emissions resulted in acid rain in the Eastern United States. Title IV of the Clean Air Act established a cap-and-trade program in 1995 to reduce these emissions. The program was successful in achieving the targeted emission level and achieved reductions at a cost that was far lower than projected. These emission reductions were obtained despite the dramatic growth in electricity demand.\President Barack Obama is calling for an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gasses, and Congress is moving fast with cap-and-trade legislation with the same ambitious goals. Environmentally, significant long-term reductions in greenhouse gas emissions must take place. Technological breakthroughs to meet this challenge will need to come from many areas --renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy storage technology, new fuels, and more. Because a cap-and-trade system is not technology specific, it can encourage and accommodate any emerging technologies.\This provides business opportunities both for Lee County's small business start-ups and large firms.\Some politicians, industry leaders and utility naysayers claim that every tax dollar applied to a ton of carbon dioxide would mean a 1 percent increase in energy rates, which is why some industry titans are fighting the changes. The same anti-cap-and-trade groups also say that those costs would be passed down to customers.\However, federal assistance money will offset these costs by moving innovative projects forward and helping to offset initial cost increases. It also will provide needed jobs right away while providing for the future environmental integrity of the planet. Cap-and-trade has proven in the past that it works for the environment and the economy. Let's get fired up about this and see it as an opportunity. And I'd like to see innovative ideas from local businesses (such as the recently approved endeavor to turn jatropha plant oil into fuel for county vehicles) come before county commissioners. Lee County needs the business and the work.\-- Lee County Commissioner Bob Janes represents District 1."
36,"Brace yourselves. President Barack Obama is expected to announce today new EPA rules to reduce carbon emissions from the nation's power plants by 20 percent and to force more polluters to participate in cap-and-trade programs. The inflammatory rhetoric from the opposition is likely to reach a Category 5 Event: Massive bloviation.\Conservatives, particularly that subset of flat-earthers who are skeptical of anything that smacks of ""science,"" are expected to pounce, first, because it involves addressing climate change; second, may be viewed as anti-coal; and third, involves executive authority, which they detest -- at least when it's wielded by a Democrat. They will rail against the regulations as costly, unnecessary and job-killing when, in fact, they are none of the above. \If anything, the prospect of reducing carbon emissions from existing power plants by 20 percent is almost criminally overdue. And the impact on electricity costs, coal production and the economy is likely to be modest -- if anything, it will produce more jobs in aggregate as new investments are made in greener energy, conservation and new markets for buying and selling government-issued pollution permits. \How can we predict this? Easy. Maryland has already started down this road as part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a nine-state coalition that has set limits on carbon-dioxide emissions in this state as well as New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Rhode Island. Emission ""allowances"" are sold at auction and the proceeds are used to promote renewable energy and supplement energy costs in low-income households. \It has not pushed electricity prices significantly higher. It has not hurt the state's economy. It has not killed jobs. And while it's true that the domestic coal industry has suffered in recent years, it's obvious that the chief culprit has been the rise of cheap and readily available natural gas. Americans are destined to get more of their electricity from gas-fueled power plants thanks more to the development of drilling technology than government regulation. \Maryland demonstrated considerable foresight in jumping on a market-based program like cap-and-trade early, and now other states will need to follow that example. And it should not be a partisan effort either, as RGGI was endorsed by Northeastern governors of both political parties when it was first developed nearly a decade ago (including at one point by a certain former investment banker and Massachusetts governor named Mitt Romney). The failure of an energy bill that contained a national cap-and-trade program in the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate in 2010 was one of the most regrettable losses of the first Obama term. \Yet this is a classic win-win situation. Cap-and-trade has an effect similar to a tax on carbon, allowing the marketplace to correct a worsening problem -- the failure to appropriately factor in the true cost of burning coal and other fossil fuels on human health and the environment. It's time to stop subsidizing the coal industry with our children's future. \Coal-fired power plants are this country's single greatest source of greenhouse gases and thus a major culprit in climate change. And it's also abundantly clear that a divided, sharply partisan Congress is fundamentally incapable of addressing this problem. That leaves only the Environmental Protection Agency and the White House to protect our future. \Make no mistake, this is not anti-business. A lot of folks in the utility industry will be pleased to see the regulations move forward, chiefly because it will finally bring some consistency to the market and create new opportunities for renewable power. Meanwhile, burning less coal will also mean reducing harmful and potentially cancer-causing byproducts like mercury and sulfuric acid that are a threat to human health and the environment as well. \Opponents can make all kinds of misleading claims about cap-and-trade, but they can't call it unproven. It's worked in the Northeast -- reducing power plant pollution by as much as 40 percent, providing $1.6 billion in new revenue for energy-related government investments and producing a negligible impact on consumers' monthly bills. The next step is to get the rest of the county on board, and then perhaps the U.S. can convince the world (at least those countries that haven't already taken similar steps) to follow.\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
37," WASHINGTON -- California Sen. Dianne Feinstein positioned herself as a key centrist on global warming Wednesday, proposing the first national cap-and-trade program to win broad backing from the electric utility industry.\ Flanked by top executives from companies including Pacific Gas & Electric and Calpine, Feinstein and co-author Sen. Tom Carper, D- Del., described the plan as having the best shot of becoming law among the many greenhouse gas bills sprouting on Capitol Hill.\ ""This is the most aggressive global warming bill that this industry has supported to date,"" said Feinstein, a Democrat. Pointing to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's bid to create a cap-and- trade system, she said, ""I believe this equals what California is trying to do.""\ The bill would reduce power plant emissions 25 percent below anticipated levels by 2020.\ Emissions would be capped at 2006 levels in 2011, and over the next decade would be reduced to 2001 levels. Emissions would be decreased 1 percent each year after that until 2020.\ At the same time, the Environmental Protection Agency would publicly auction credits. Most of that revenue would go toward helping companies purchase clean technology.\ Feinstein projected that the auction would raise at least $9 billion by 2036, and possibly as much as $55 billion.\ ""(Global warming is) happening. But if we act now, with purpose, the most serious consequences can be averted,"" Feinstein said.\ PG&E Corp. chief executive officer Peter Darby called Feinstein's bill ""pragmatic and aggressive, a serious response to a serious problem.""\ In total, the companies -- which also included Entergy, Florida Power and Light, Exelon and the Public Service Enterprise Group -- operate in 42 states and supply more than 15 percent of electricity consumed in the U.S.\ The bill does not address coal-fired plants. Lawmakers on Wednesday suggested attacking coal will likely meet with fierce political resistance.\ ""There's coal in 40 states. That makes the garnering of votes here in the Senate very difficult,"" Feinstein acknowledged.\ While she reached out to a number of companies for feedback while crafting the bill, Feinstein said Southern California Edison notably declined to work with her office.\ ""I assume it's because they have coal. I was very disappointed,"" she said.\ A spokeswoman for Southern California Edison declined to discuss Feinstein's bill specifically and said the company is evaluating several global warming-related bills.\ Meanwhile, the bill produced a lukewarm response from environmentalists.\ ""We are looking forward to working with her further in hopes of bringing the proposal closer to what we see as the necessary steps,"" said Natural Resources Defense Council spokeswoman Julia Bovey.\ ""We don't want the best bill that can pass. We want the best bill,"" Bovey said, noting a sweeping measure by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and California Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat, is considered the gold standard in global warming law.\ Feinstein's bill is expected to be one of many released in the coming weeks to address global warming.\ Boxer, who chairs the Senate Environment Committee, will consider all the greenhouse gas-related proposals, her spokeswoman said.\ lisa.friedman(at)langnews.com\ (202) 662-8731"
38,"WASHINGTON - Key lawmakers agreed yesterday on a strategy for replacing gas-guzzling cars with more fuel-efficient models, but much tougher negotiations lie ahead on a bill that would, for the first time, limit emissions linked to global warming.\President Obama summoned three dozen House Democrats to the White House to build consensus around climate and energy legislation that is under increasing criticism from Republicans and members of his own party.\The administration has endorsed the bill broadly, saying it would advance key parts of the president's domestic agenda, namely slowing global warming and transitioning to a clean energy economy.\But the details have largely been left to the House Energy committee, which is still working on the final language and has postponed a vote due to cost concerns raised by the panel's moderate Democrats and Democrats from coal- and oil-producing states that could struggle to meet the bill's mandates for pollution reductions and renewable electricity generation.\Committee members emerged from yesterday's meeting claiming a modest victory. They said they agreed to embrace a ""cash for clunkers"" plan that would provide $3,500 or $4,500 to people who replace old cars with new, more fuel-efficient models.\""Our committee is attempting to develop a consensus,"" panel chairman Henry Waxman of California said after the session, which all but two of the committee's 36 Democrats attended. ""Many of the issues split us along a regional basis. But we're talking to each other.""\Representative John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who pushed for the ""cash for clunkers"" provision, said its inclusion in the bill does not guarantee he will support the legislation in its entirety. Chief among the loose ends is a ""cap and trade"" proposal that would set a ceiling and put a price on greenhouse gas emissions. Companies could either purchase or receive their allowance for free, and then buy or sell portions of their allotment to meet emissions limits.\Obama's budget expects to raise $650 billion by auctioning off all the allowances to companies that release heat-trapping gases, with the bulk of the money going back to families to help with higher energy prices.\Democrats from coal and industrial states are pushing Waxman and his cosponsor, Representative Edward Markey of Massachusetts, to distribute at least some of those permits for free to ease costs.\As the Democrats met with Obama, House Republicans gathered at the Capitol for an energy summit to criticize the Waxman-Markey bill, which they said would create a national energy tax and hurt middle-class families and small businesses. Similar meetings are being planned this month in Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, and California before Republicans unveil their own plans to curb fossil fuel use and clean up the environment.\Representative Mike Pence of Indiana said yesterday that Republicans will look for commonsense solutions to lower energy costs, increase energy supply and create jobs. But he also acknowledged that part of their mission was to stop the ""profoundly bad idea"" of cap and trade.\Credit: Dina Cappiello, Associated Press"
39,"THE Washington power play to pass cap-and-trade legislation is deflating like a punctured balloon, but all the air is not out of it yet. \According to Reuters, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a climate legislation supporter, told environmental leaders in a private meeting last week that ""cap-and-trade is dead."" Graham has been working with John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., for months to get a cap-and-trade bill through the Senate.\The House of Representatives approved a climate bill last June.\But in recent months, climate fears have dissipated. Americans are much more worried about the economy - and less convinced that man's activities are causing a global meltdown.\A nationwide poll done by West Virginia's Mark Blankenship Enterprises for the National Federation of Independent Businesses found that 52 percent of Americans oppose cap-and-trade, while 37 percent support the legislation.\Americans worry that cap-and-trade will drive up their energy bills, cost jobs, and limit economic growth.\Those are additional burdens Americans want to avoid at a time when they continue to struggle with an uncertain economy and a slow recovery.\Now Kerry-Graham-Liberman have developed a fallback position to try to revive the process. The New York Times reports the trio will propose ""different types of limits for different sectors of the economy, beginning with electric utilities and then turning later to manufacturers such as chemical plants and pulp and paper mills.""\Meanwhile, the pressure is building on the Environmental Protection Agency to back away from its attempt to regulate greenhouse gas emissions by fiat. The EPA is in the process of designating carbon and other greenhouse gases as pollutants, then using the Clean Air Act to reduce the amount of carbon released into atmosphere.\Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Ark., is pushing a measure in the Senate aimed at stopping the EPA, and now there's a similar measure in the House of Representatives. Two top House Democrats, Collin Peterson, D-Minn., and Ike Skelton, D-Mo., are co-sponsoring a resolution along with Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., to trump the EPA's attempts to regulate carbon emissions.\Meanwhile, Sens. Jay Rockefeller and Robert Byrd of West Virginia have sent a letter to the EPA telling the agency not to proceed with greenhouse gas regulations. The letter, co-signed by a number of other energy state senators, says the EPA should leave it to the Congress to develop energy policy.\EPA has agreed to slow down its implementation of the Clean Air regulations on CO2 until at least 2011. Total regulation would not come until 2013.\That gives the Democrats some breathing room until they have a better opportunity to pass climate legislation.\So here's how the merry-go-round works:\The Obama administration and some members of Congress want cap-and-trade legislation to protect the environment and bring in billions of dollars in new revenue. When the bill starts to bog down, the EPA threatens to regulate carbon on its own.\Proponents of cap-and-trade think the EPA action is enough to convince wavering lawmakers that it's better for the Congress to pass cap-and-trade than live by the EPA's decision.\It was a pretty smart maneuver, the ultimate Washington power play.\And it could still work if lawmakers like Byrd and Rockefeller continue to see cap-and-trade as inevitable.\But the advocates have misjudged by not considering the full impact of Climategate revelations or the obvious reluctance of the American people to further damage the economy and raise their own taxes to achieve the improbable goal of lowering the earth's temperature by a fraction."
0,"YELLOW SPRINGS -- This village could become home to the largest solar power array in Southwest Ohio in 2012 as part of a $65 million project to put new solar power in smaller Ohio villages and cities. \Mike Dickman, vice president of SolarVision of Westerville near Columbus, said he's close to a financing deal for the ambitious project. He'd like to break ground later this year, he said. \Aside from federal tax credits that will be part of the project, the financing now in its last phases is from private sources, Dickman said. \In Yellow Springs, a 2.5 megawatt array is planned for part of 44 acres of farmland owned by the village that's northwest of town off King Street, said Mark Cundiff, village manager. \Yellow Springs signed a purchase agreement for all the electricity and plans to use it during periods of high demand to lower costs during ""peak"" periods, Cundiff said. \A megawatt (MW) of power is equivalent to one million watts. Renewable energy, because it relies on natural factors, does not produce a consistent power stream. For example, the 1.1 MW Dayton Power & Light solar array in Washington Twp. produces enough electricity to power 150 average homes in a year, but up to 750 on bright days. \Between the solar array and new Ohio River hydroelectric projects being built now, Yellow Springs intends to draw more than 50 percent of its power needs from renewable sources in 2013, Cundiff said. \Yellow Springs owns its electric power distribution system. \The village's aggressive renewable goal is being helped by American Municipal Power Inc. or AMP, which is building new hydro projects on the Ohio River at existing dams. \AMP said that the projects will add 300 megawatts of capacity. AMP has called the projects ""the largest development of new run-of-the-river hydroelectric generation in the country."" \Dickman said other sites planned for solar arrays include Celina, Wapakoneta, Greenfield, Carey, Wellington, Clyde and Newark. The projects should generate 20 megawatts of electricity, more than any single solar installation operating in Ohio. \Dayton Power & Light's 1.1 megawatt facility at 9975 Yankee St. in Washington Twp. began operating in 2010. \Ohio law has an alternative energy standard requiring that 25 percent of electricity sold by Ohio's electric distribution utilities or electric services companies be generated from alternative energy sources by 2025. At least half must be from renewables, such as solar, wind, biomass and hydro with a minimum of one-half percent from solar. One half of the renewable energy must be from Ohio installations. \Coal powers 86 percent of Ohio's electric generation, natural gas and other gases account for 2 percent, Nuclear power is 10 percent and wind, solar and hydro make up about 1 percent.\Credit: By Steve Bennish, Staff Writer"
1,"News-Leader\Jefferson City -- The hot- button issue of Missouri's law mandating ethanol be blended into gasoline re-emerged in a Senate agriculture committee hearing Wednesday.\Sen. Matt Bartle, R-Lee's Summit, presented his case for repealing the 13-month-old 10 percent ethanol standard before a Senate panel of mostly farmers, a few of whom have a financial interest in the biofuels industry.\By mandating ethanol be blended into gasoline when the corn-based alcohol is cheaper than regular gasoline, Bartle said the state has created a system of winners and losers, disrupting the free market system.\""We're coming along and saying 'government knows better,'"" Bartle said in a nearly 20-minute monologue that delved deeply into conservative economic philosophy. ""We are picking ethanol over other alternative (energy) technologies ... that might produce less dependence on foreign oil.""\Missouri's alternative energy standard went into effect Jan. 1, 2008. Until November of last year, most gasoline sold at stations in the state contained 10 percent ethanol, as mandated by the new law.\But when gasoline and oil prices plummeted this fall, the ethanol mandate was voided by a price- trigger requirement designed to ensure customers are only forced to buy ethanol-blended gasoline when it's less expensive.\Before the mandate, Bartle said, 70 percent of Missouri's gas stations and convenience stores sold gasoline with 10 percent ethanol, also known as E10, which most internal combustion vehicles can handle.\""I didn't need government to tell me that I had to buy one fuel or another,"" Bartle said.\And with ethanol producers already receiving a 51-cent per gallon federal subsidy, Bartle said the mandate ensures ethanol is profitable when the price of gas is high. He equated it to a ""welfare"" system for corn farmers.\Bartle said the ethanol mandate has more to do with corn farmers having a powerful lobby in Jefferson City than sound public policy.\""The reason we do it is because we all like corn farmers,"" Bartle told the panel, which includes three corn farmers.\Bartle also said livestock farmers have been adversely affected by the rising demand for field corn at ethanol plants, which extract the alcohol to make the fuel.\Despite Bartle's pleas for the committee to renew their faith in capitalism and vote out a repeal of the mandate, he wasn't getting much sympathy.\""None of us here are going to change our minds,"" said Sen. Frank Barnitz, a livestock farmer and Democrat from Lake Spring.\Chaired by Republican Sen. Dan Clemens, a Webster County farmer, the agriculture committee includes of some of the Senate's most ardent supporters of biofuels.\Sen. Wes Shoemyer, a Democrat and farmer in northeast Missouri, is an ethanol and biodiesel investor. Sen. Bill Stouffer, R-Napton, is a Saline County farmer and also has invested in a biodiesel plant.\Both Shoemyer and Stouffer have received state tax credits for their investments in agribusinesses while serving in the legislature, The Associated Press reported last year.\Shoemyer said the emergence of biofuels and the profits that have followed has made farming a financial reality for his children.\""I really believe that this made a difference for my kid to come back home,"" Shoemyer told Bartle.\Prior to Bartle's hearing, Stouffer presented a bill that would extend the mandate to diesel fuel, requiring all diesel is blended with 5 percent biodiesel, which typically comes from soybean oil.\Stouffer defended Bartle's claim that the ethanol mandate has diverted field corn from its traditional use for feeding livestock to ethanol plants, thus driving up the price of food in the grocery store.\Stouffer noted that since field corn, gasoline and ethanol prices dropped a few months ago, the price of food has remained the same.\""If ethanol was what pushed the price of food up, why haven't they gone down?"" Stouffer asked.\Stouffer said there's a ""social value"" for Missouri by depending on less foreign oil.\Bartle later told Stouffer: ""It's always tempting to force our people to buy things that they would not otherwise buy."""

GOV. John Kasich interrupted his presidential campaign last week to return to Ohio. While he was in Columbus, he asserted that he sees no need even to ask voters in 2016 whether they want the state to borrow as much as $1 billion to help pay to clean up Lake Erie and other key waterways. ""I don't see any reason to really do any more at this point,"" he said.
\
The governor added that he has no interest in reversing one of the worst failures of his administration: his acquiescence in the terrible decision last year by the Republican-controlled General Assembly to repudiate Ohio's standards to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. That measure was a transparent sop to Columbus' imposing fossil-fuel lobbies.
\
Mr. Kasich evidently believes that such positions burnish his credentials for national political leadership - or at least the GOP presidential nomination. Maybe the latter, but certainly not the former.
\
Northwest Ohioans do not need to be reminded that a harmful algae bloom in western Lake Erie generated a toxin that poisoned Toledo's water supply for three days in the summer of 2014, depriving nearly 500,000 consumers of their usual source of drinking water. A new study by scientists at Ohio State University and elsewhere warns that the number of major blooms in the lake, already chronically high, could double in the next 100 years.
\
Yet Mr. Kasich seems content with modest measures to limit agricultural pollution of Lake Erie's tributaries, such as a new law that restricts farmers' application of manure and chemical fertilizer on frozen or saturated ground. The governor has joined calls for a 40 percent reduction over the next decade in the amount of phosphorus, which feeds toxic algae, flowing into western Lake Erie. Some environmental scientists suggest that goal is already inadequate.
\
The proposal to place a clean-water bond issue on next year's statewide ballot is bipartisan; Republican state Sen. Randy Gardner of Bowling Green is one of its strongest advocates. It has support, at least in principle, from a range of environmental, farm, and business interests.
\
The plan would usefully address a variety of environmental risks - including toxic algae -to Lake Erie, the Ohio River, and other major bodies of water across the state. It seeks to reduce water pollution by a broad range of sources. A competing proposal would focus on sewer overflows.
\
Either way, Mr. Kasich's conspicuous disinterest in the ballot measure won't help. Last week, he instead blamed outsiders - other states, Detroit, Canada- for polluting Lake Erie.
\
The new Lake Erie study concludes that human-made climate change could""supercharge"" the growth of harmful algae. The two-year pause in Ohio's alternative-energy standard that the governor and legislature enacted last year is contributing to climate change by encouraging the state's over-reliance on fossil fuels, notably coal, to generate electric power. That outcome is at odds with, among other things, the new global agreement on climate change reached this month in Paris.
\
To his credit, Governor Kasich has rejected a legislative proposal to extend the freeze on energy standards indefinitely. But he also said last week that he doesn't want Ohio to revert fully to the former clean-energy mandates. That seems a distinction without much of a difference.
\
Mr. Kasich also has refused to petition the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to declare the western Lake Erie basin a""distressed"" watershed. That action would allow closer scrutiny and regulation of pollution sources such as the heavily subsidized factory farms known as concentrated animal feeding operations.
\
The Kasich administration claims that such a designation would impair the public image of the western Lake Erie region. Not as much as a reprise of Toledo's water crisis would.
\
During the Republican debate this month, Mr. Kasich outlined the elements of political victory next year in Ohio, a key swing state in presidential elections. A candidate's message, he insisted, ""has to be big and bold and positive.""
\
A comprehensive, meaningful plan to repair Lake Erie, the state's most vital natural asset, would fit that description admirably. But such an economic and environmental boon doesn't appear to be on the governor's agenda.
\
Voters are told repeatedly that Governor Kasich is the thoughtful, responsible, moderate candidate in the GOP presidential field. And compared to his rivals, he is. It's all relative, but that observation isn't particularly comforting.

Charlie Crist, the man without a party, still manages to find a way to be invited to one and deliver a message. President Barack Obama's invitation to the former Republican governor to speak at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday was attacked by Republicans in Florida and elsewhere as a desperate act by two self-serving politicians. But the reality is that Crist has a message to deliver about pragmatic governing based on consensus-building rather than ideological purity. When he felt unwelcome in his own political party, he left and changed his voter registration to no party affiliation. And that says more about the modern Republican Party than it does about the former Florida governor.

Crist said Tuesday that he will strive in his speech before an anticipated 65,000 people in a football stadium to give ""a fuller perspective on (Obama's) wonderful leadership."" And taken outside the partisan prism, it's not that surprising that Crist is backing Obama over the Republican nominee, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney.
\
As Florida governor from 2007-11, Crist's moderate agenda had more in common with the current Democratic platform than the stridently conservative one Republicans approved last week in Tampa at the Republican National Convention. Crist supported immigration reform, embraced stimulus funding as a way to keep Floridians working, backed public school teachers, sought to set a new alternative energy standard for the state to address climate change, provided a path for felons to get their civil rights restored, and even kept the polls open longer in 2008 for early voting.
\
Contrast that with today. In Florida under Gov. Rick Scott, Republicans have made it harder to register to vote and cast ballots. The governor rejected $2.4 billion for high-speed rail linking Tampa to Orlando, and he and legislative leaders have refused to accept millions in federal money for health care reform and to help low-income pregnant women. Scott signed a budget that cut $1.3 billion in public education last year, then bragged this year that the state had increased education spending by $1 billion when the truth is that Florida is still spending less on education than when he took office.
\
Of course, Crist is not wholly in line with Obama and Democrats - which actually makes his appearance more refreshing. He has repeatedly opposed raising taxes and gun control. He is no supporter of abortion rights and gay marriage. But on social issues, he has been a live-and-let-live lawmaker and has said the current GOP platform outlawing all abortions goes too far. Crist is a populist, and there is little room for populists anymore in the Republican Party.
\
Some have seen Crist's defection to Obama's camp as opportunistic, giving the possible future candidate a chance to address a national audience. But the real importance of Crist's presence is as a symbol of moderation and cooperation. Americans from different perspectives can work together for common goals toward a better future, even if they don't agree on everything. That is the antidote to extremism, writ large.

Progress Energy Florida leaders are emphatic that they want to repair the utility's Crystal River nuclear plant and return it to operation. But their acknowledgement last week that shuttering the nuclear plant might eventually prove more financially pragmatic caught customers of the state's second-largest utility by surprise. Now Progress Energy's long-assumed strategy for providing power for the region hangs in the balance given the uncertain future of the Crystal River plant and the continued ambiguity about whether a proposed nuclear plant will be built in Levy County. As Progress Energy proposes its solution for Crystal River, it must make a convincing argument that the fix will work, the expense will be prudent and the facility will continue to function safely.
\
Nothing about the recent events at Crystal River is encouraging. Discovery of a gap in the nuclear reactor's containment wall during scheduled maintenance took the facility off line in 2009, forcing the utility to shift power generation to coal or gas plants and increasing fuel costs. As repairs to the gap in one of the wall's six panels were near completion last month, the utility found a second gap in another panel. Progress Energy says it will update Florida's Public Service Commission on June 27 about its plan for repairs.
\
But there is no guarantee the facility will eventually return to service, prompting the acknowledgement last week that decommissioning the plant remains an option. Progress Energy's proposed fix for Crystal River will need to pass muster with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which deals with safety and operational issues, and the PSC, which will decide how the repairs or a decommissioning will be financed. Progress Energy is not yet offering cost estimates for either option beyond the $440 million that's already been spent. But neither alternative would be cheap.
\
Those costs, and how much insurance will cover, will clearly weigh heavily in the utility's decision. But so too should the long-term costs for its 1.6 million customers, whether that's for repairs or for decommissioning and the cost of switching to more expensive fuels such as natural gas.
\
Unfortunately, Progress Energy will make a final decision on Crystal River in the absence of any state or federal energy policy aimed at tackling the long-term need of both Florida and the nation to diversify the power supply and lessen the dependence on ozone-damaging fossil fuels. President Barack Obama and Congress remain paralyzed on the issue, and, when he was governor, Charlie Crist's effort to encourage an alternative energy standard fell largely on deaf ears in the Republican-led Legislature.
\
A clear energy policy would give Progress Energy and the public a far better understanding of the broader implications for repairing the Crystal River plant long term or replacing it with a combination of other technologies, be it natural gas or renewable solar or wind. Short of that, however, Progress Energy must remain forthcoming about its options, emphasize safety and respect its customers' financial interests in making a final proposal for moving forward.

COLUMBUS -- An environmental group on Wednesday launched a campaign urging Ohioans to boycott FirstEnergy Corp.'s marketing arm to protest what it says are efforts by Toledo Edison to undercut Ohio's renewable energy and efficiency standards.
\
""It is time for us to stop FirstEnergy,"" said Dan Sawmiller, senior representative of Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign in Ohio. ""We will not stand by any longer without taking direct action.""
\
The first electronic billboard has gone up across from the Statehouse in Columbus where lawmakers may soon revisit Ohio's 2008 law requiring utilities to find at least 25 percent of their power from renewable or advanced technology sources by 2025.
\
FirstEnergy Solutions, the retail electricity supplier affiliate of the Akron-based utility, markets itself as an alternative to traditional utilities -- including FirstEnergy itself -- in multiple states in the Midwest and the East. Central Ohio is a major marketing target because FirstEnergy Solutions has been going after customers of American Electric Power there.
\
The boycott campaign plans paid advertising, online ads, mailers, and direct contact to urge consumers to sign a pledge that they will not sign a contract to buy their power from FirstEnergy Solutions.
\
Under state law, half of the 25 percent alternative energy standard, or 12.5 percent, must come from renewable sources such as wind, solar, and landfill gases. Half a percentage point must come from solar.
\
The advanced sources can also include such things as nuclear, fuel cells, and cleaner coal technology. Most of Ohio's electricity comes from coal-fired power plants.
\
The requirement for renewable and advanced energy could be suspended once the cost to consumers increases by more than 3 percent, but no utility has yet invoked that cap.
\
""We're not aware of any impact [the Sierra Club campaign] may be having, but we certainly feel their campaign is misleading,"" said FirstEnergy spokesman Doug Colafella.
\
""Like other utilities in Ohio, we have programs that help customers reduce their energy use,"" he said. ""It's a shame that this campaign could mislead customers into missing out on reducing their electric bills by switching to FirstEnergy Solutions.""
\
The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio recently ordered FirstEnergy Corp. to refund $43.3 million to its 2 million customers for overcharging them for renewable energy credits it acquired through its subsidiary to comply with the law. On Wednesday, at the request of multiple parties on both sides, including FirstEnergy, the PUCO agreed to reopen the case.
\
Ohio Sen. Bill Seitz (R., Cincinnati) is expected to introduce a bill sometime this fall to revisit the standards, with the emphasis expected to be primarily on efficiency as opposed to renewable energy.

6,"Money to repair highways, rising health-care costs and controversies surrounding attempts to combat global warming are among topics the nation's governors plan to tackle when they gather this week in West Virginia. The National Governors Association summer meeting, which runs until Saturday at The Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, comes as states find themselves grappling with an array of issues that defy easy answers. Those include long-range funding for infrastructure upgrades, the effects of prolonged drought and adequately funding public schools and colleges.\States' economic conditions generally have improved since the national recession, but the retirement of the baby boom population will put pressure on governments as public pension and health care costs continue to rise, said Jack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College in southern California.\""In the short term, it's not too bad because the economy has been recovering and a lot of the states are not in those dire fiscal situations they were in a few years ago, Pitney said. ""However, every farsighted state governor knows the good times won't last.\Some storm clouds already are appearing. An Associated Press analysis this spring found that at least 22 states will be dealing with budget shortfalls for the 2016 fiscal year. This month, the AP also found that enrollments and costs have surged way beyond projections in many of the states that opted to expand Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act.\Because Medicaid costs account for such a large part of state budgets, that is raising concerns that states will have to make cuts in education and other areas to afford the low-income health care program once the federal government begins reducing its share.\Missing from the conference will be the four governors who are vying for the Republican nomination for president next year. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, John Kasich of Ohio and Scott Walker of Wisconsin have commitments elsewhere, according to their staffs and campaign officials.\Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, the association chairman, and Republican Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah, the vice chairman, did not make themselves available for interviews before the meeting.\West Virginia's struggling southern coalfields help illustrate the divide between governors who urge swift action on climate change and those who are fighting regulations against greenhouse gas emissions because of their state's reliance on the fossil fuel industry.\California Gov. Jerry Brown had been scheduled to give an address at the conference but instead flew to Rome, where he attended a Vatican summit called by Pope Francis following the release of his encyclical on climate change and poverty. In a speech Tuesday, Brown said global warming deniers were putting ""troglodytes into office rather than environmentally responsible leaders.\The Democratic governor is pushing a state plan that his administration calls the most aggressive carbon-reduction benchmark in North America. It would increase statewide renewable electricity use to 50 percent, have drivers use half as much gasoline and make buildings twice as energy-efficient as they are now.\By comparison, elected officials from both parties in West Virginia blast the Obama administration's push to curb greenhouse gas emissions. They say the regulations unfairly target an already-fizzling Appalachian coal industry.\The state has led or joined lawsuits against several U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations.\This year, West Virginia got rid of its state alternative energy standard, although it was hardly strict. Burning many types of coal - and even tires - counted as alternative energy. The coal industry helped write the law in the first place but came out in opposition to it this year.\""When we look at changes in our policy in this country, we need to also look at the economics involved with it and what effect it's having on coal states, said West Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, a Democrat. ""Obviously, we can all see what effect it's having here in West Virginia, as far as the loss of jobs and, which goes along with that, the loss in tax dollars.\Faced with ballooning health-care costs, governors also will hear from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell, a West Virginia native. U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Thomas Perez will be the other high-level federal official addressing the group.\Governors also are anxiously awaiting action from Congress on a transportation bill as their roads, highways and bridges worsen. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, announced a deal on a six-year funding bill earlier this week, but it immediately ran into procedural delays from Democrats.\Authority for transportation programs expires July 31, which would eliminate the transportation department's ability to process promised highway and transit aid to states.\Already, the total money available to states from the Federal Highway Trust Fund has declined 3.5 percent during the five-year period ending in 2013, according to figures compiled by The Associated Press.\Some states, including ones like Michigan with Republican leadership, are mulling tax and fee hikes to address pressing road problems.\Credit: Jonathan Mattise The Associated Press"
7,"While efforts to boost the use of natural gas as an alternative fuel in Oklahoma continue to gain momentum, those efforts need to continue, energy experts said last week.\In a media statement issued by outgoing House Speaker Chris Benge, the lawmaker said business leaders are showing increased interest in developing the state's natural gas market.\""From a public policy standpoint, energy security is one of the top issues facing this country right now,"" said Benge, R-Tulsa. ""It's clear that both Oklahoma's citizens and business leaders are embracing this idea and joining the effort to promote locally produced fuels like natural gas.""\Officials with the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association agreed.\""Several private companies, including Apache Corp. and Chesapeake Energy, are replacing their regular fuel vehicles with natural gas-powered vehicles,"" said Cody Bannister, OIPA spokesman.\Bannister said the biggest change could be spawned in fleet vehicles.\""The biggest gain is in fleet vehicles,"" he said. ""Companies are replacing cars and trucks that typically run the same routes with natural gas vehicles. Those are the most viable options.""\Benge agreed. Speaking at a Tulsa Metro Chamber event last week, he said the state is at the forefront in expanding the nation's natural gas market.\""When looking at alternative fuels, the no-brainer for Oklahoma is natural gas,"" Benge said. ""It creates jobs in Oklahoma and provides greater energy security for the country.""\Industry studies show the United States spends about $100 million per day on imported oil, including oil generated in regions hostile to Americans. But at the same time, those studies show an estimated 100-year supply of natural gas is still available for production on the American continent.\""And that supply is increasing, thanks to successful technological advancements in horizontal drilling,"" Benge said.\Benge said energy security - on the state and national level - has been a focal point of his tenure as speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives.\He said state lawmakers have enacted policies that encourage the use of natural gas for vehicles and the installation of corresponding fueling infrastructure and continue to develop proposals for the development of the fueling infrastructure.\""We want to be aggressive in building the network of fueling stations,"" he said. ""As a result of Oklahoma's policies, there are currently around a dozen more natural gas fueling stations in the development pipeline.""\Bannister said those ideas would allow natural gas to be used as a ""bridge fuel"" as the country makes a switch from petroleum to other energy sources.\""We've seen a lot of promotion for natural gas as a bridge fuel,"" he said. ""It's here, it's affordable and it's accessible.""\And new technologies, Bannister said, have expanded the supply.\""The use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have opened vast amounts of natural gas across the country that were, 20 years ago, unproducable,"" he said.\To help develop the state's market for natural gas, Benge said lawmakers passed the Oklahoma Energy Security Act this year, which set an alternative-energy goal, including having one public natural gas fueling station every 100 miles along the state's interstate system by the year 2015 and every 50 miles by 2025.\""Oklahoma is reportedly the only state with an alternative-energy standard set specifically for natural gas,"" he said.\Benge said the price advantage of natural gas, along with the increased energy security, will make the fuel a major part of the national energy policy discussion.\""Everyone was really focused on this issue when gasoline was $4 per gallon,"" he said. ""I don't want the public to forget we still have a real challenge ahead of us. Prices may have come down from a high of a couple of years ago, but we are still facing the need to address the nation's energy security.""\That's the right direction, Bannister said.\""We taken some great first steps to develop the market,"" he said. ""But there are still more steps to take.""\Credit: M. Scott Carter"
8,"The day after West Virginia Republican lawmakers started tax reform talks, coal giant Murray Energy laid off 214 miners with a clear message calling for lower state taxes to unearth coal. After last week's layoffs, Murray's subsidiary condemned the Obama administration and lamented cheaper natural gas reserves. What surprised Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, though, was that Murray blasted the state coal severance tax as ""extremely excessive.\""That's really the first time I've had anyone say anything about our severance tax, said Tomblin, a Democrat.\The tax will be under review as the GOP-led Legislature mulls ways to reshape the tax code, said Senate President Bill Cole, R-Mercer.\During the industry's downturn, the spigot of coal severance cash has slowed considerably. Tomblin expressed concerns about trying to cut an already-shrinking revenue source that helps cover a variety of costs, from education to health care.\A chunk also goes back to county governments. Recently, struggling southern coal counties have laid off law enforcement officers and made other cuts, attributing them at least partly to falling severance money.\""One of the things we're blessed with is our energy in West Virginia, Tomblin said. ""I can't imagine right now reducing the taxes.\Cole called the tax review ""the next step to help coal, after passing bills last session to trim mining regulations and scrap a state alternative energy standard. Tomblin signed both.\A committee on tax reform is underway, and the next session starts in January.\Robert Murray, the company's namesake and a loud critic of President Obama's energy policies, just last week bet even bigger on coal. Murray Energy paid $1.4 billion for a controlling interest of Foresight Energy, which mines the thick coal seams in the Illinois Basin. Murray's West Virginia mines are up north, which has remained a more productive region than the state's thinning southern seams.\The coal executive also gave state Republicans a big lift last election. His company's $250,000 donation to a conservative super PAC was one of the biggest all cycle, and helped lift Republicans to their first state legislative majorities in more than eight decades.\At the federal level, Murray and other coal operators say they'll be crippled by Obama's climate change pushes, which call for reductions in carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants.\At the state level, the company says coal pays well more than its fair share.\Other than a surtax likely disappearing next year, the coal severance tax hasn't been raised since 1989. In 1997, mines with thinner seams got a break.\Companies now pay 1, 2 or 5 percent, depending on seam thickness.\Since December 2005, producers have paid 56 cents per ton to cover a worker's compensation debt, a tax expected to be dropped sometime next year, according to the Department of Revenue.\Combined, coal severance brought in $407.2 million last budget year, including $63.7 million for the debt payback. That's compared to $451.6 million in 2013 and $531.1 million in 2012.\Similar taxes exist for extracting resources like natural gas, which has boomed and helped prop up the budget during coal's decline.\It's hard to compare severance taxes across states because different coal burns at different rates, state Deputy Revenue Secretary Mark Muchow said.\Wyoming charges 3.74 percent underground and 7 percent for surface mining; Kentucky taxes a flat 4.5 percent; Pennsylvania has none; Ohio levies 10 cents per ton, plus reclamation fees; and North Dakota taxes 37.5 cents per ton, according to the West Virginia Department of Revenue.\West Virginia Coal Association President Bill Raney said the state's severance tax level puts it at a competitive disadvantage.

\
WOOSTER -- Whichever candidate is elected as state representative in the 3rd District will likely take with him some new ideas about education, business and the role of government.
\
Republican Ron Amstutz, who now serves in the Ohio Senate, is running against Democrat Merle Joe Miller for state representative.
\
Both have differing views on the major issues and different goals about how to improve the state's education system and economy.
\
Amstutz said one of the biggest tasks is helping Ohioans become more connected with the workplace. He said internships and similar programs are a necessary means of engaging students with the work world and that such programs should start as early as the sixth-grade.
\
""The seeds for that need to be planted earlier and started earlier,"" he said. ""I think there's a whole lot of students that have no connections for work, all the way through high school even. It's not true for all, but it's true for a lot.""
\
Miller, who is vice president of sales for the Santmyer Oil Co., supports a modified version of President Ronald Reagan's plan to get the most out of school days, school years and curriculum. He advocates extending the school year to about 230 days and the school day by 30-60 minutes.
\
Additionally, Miller said high school students should be required to study four years of English (as most already require), four years of science and math and that foreign language should begin in the sixth grade, possibly the third grade.
\
Miller said these standards would cost more and require more support by educators and communities, but it is the kind of direction he thinks education should go.
\
""That's the kind of effort we need in our education,"" he said.
\
Along with better education, which both candidates said will improve graduates for the demands of today's jobs, both candidates also support the work of BioHio, which they expect to create some of the jobs students pursue.
\
Amstutz said BioHio has already attracted existing businesses, such as Schmack BioEnergy, which produces biogas, and will continue to do so as it develops.
\
""All the major research universities in Ohio and beyond have been pushing to do this,"" Amstutz said. ""It's part of jump-starting our economy. It's not the only thing, by any means, but it's a very important frontier for us to be working in.""
\
Miller said Ohio is behind in its pursuit of alternative energy and acting on a bioenergy standard, which is largely why he's running for office. He said of BioHio that he's ""encouraged that we can encourage research to come in and to do research in our part of the country.""
\
Miller said he has invested in a biodiesel plant in Toledo, expected to begin production in about a month, something he said the local area could also support. He's also working on a project in Toledo to turn seaweed into usable energy, which he said if works there, then it could also work in Wayne County.
\
""We have to encourage this industry to come in,"" Miller said. ""If it's (BioHio) like Toledo, once you get industry in, one thing leads to another.""
\
Amstutz said some of the specific changes he hopes to make are with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and the Bureau of Workers' Compensation.
\
Both, he said, have lost their focus and are hurting the business community, especially medium- to small-sized businesses. The problem with the EPA, he said, is communities are being fined for issues related to paperwork.
\
""We've got to break that cycle because it is a very discouraging thing to our business community when they come up against these almost 'attack fines' from the OEPA,"" Amstutz said.
\
As for Workers' Compensation, Amstutz said the problem isn't in legitimate claims, but instead is in claims that defeat the program's purpose.
\
""It (Worker's Compensation) has a very important purpose, but that purpose has been sidetracked by inappropriate abuse by the trial attorneys,"" Amstutz said.
\
Miller said his biggest focus in the House will be to improve the state's standing with alternative energy, and get it to become more business-oriented.
\
He said the biggest issue is ""inaction from the state government standpoint. Ohio has not been an aggressive state to go out and get industry.""
\
Miller said the state is ""dead last"" in establishing alternative energy for Ohio, which he said is the result of inaction.
\
""I would like to see Ohio go to a minimum (ethanol requirement) of 15 percent, if not 20 percent, on all vehicles the next three-five years,"" he said.
\
Miller said he understands the impact increased ethanol production could have on the area's livestock farmers, who would likely be faced with higher feed bills, but that many also produce their own feed and that more benefit from higher grain prices than do not.
\
""Some of these grain farmers have made more money the past three or four years than they have for years and years,"" Miller said. ""Yes, they (livestock farmers) get hurt in the situation, but you can't scrap the whole thing because a few people get hurt.""
\
Amstutz said the state has adopted a standard with Gov. Ted Strickland's alternative energy standard, which requires that by 2025 at least 25 percent of the state's electricity be produced by advanced energy technology.
\
He said the state has also identified fuel cells as an area Ohio can succeed and has several ongoing efforts already in place, including at Case Western Reserve University.
\
Miller said he plans to apply business principles he gained in the gas industry to the government, and the idea of taking action on whatever front is necessary, reducing the number of government employees and offices, if necessary.
\
""You cannot use this mindset of things will take care of themselves, problems will take care of themselves and do nothing,"" he said. ""You have to go in and take on the problems of the day.""
\
Amstutz said he plans to carry his eight years in the Ohio Senate into office, along with his ""experience, expertise and passion for service."" He spent 20 years as a state representative for this area before becoming a senator.
\
He said he especially plans to work the separation between rural and central urban areas, to ""try to help people in those areas find a way to improve themselves.""

11,"When the dust settles from the end-of-the-session bill-passing frenzy, environmental groups said yesterday, they believe that the legislature's action on some issues - and inaction on others - will mean mixed results for the state's environment.\Sailing through the legislature were an energy bill hailed as a landmark for requiring utilities to buy some of their electricity from alternative-energy sources and a controversial measure to provide funding to rebuild and repair aging sewer and water systems.\But Gov. Rendell's proposed Growing Greener II program was not acted on. The $800 million program was designed to provide dedicated funding for hazardous-waste cleanup and watershed improvements and expand open space and farmland protection.\The bill failed to move because Republicans and industry groups remain staunchly opposed to Rendell's plan to fund the program by imposing fees on polluters and increasing landfill fees.\But Kathleen McGinty, secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection, said in an interview yesterday that failure to approve the funding would have an impact on public health.\With funds rapidly dwindling, she said, her agency has already been forced to scale back its effort to clean up dozens of polluted sites, including wells in East Norriton Township in Montgomery County contaminated with a chemical used in dry cleaning.\The renewable energy bill, which caused a rare division among the state's leading environmental groups, would require that utilities buy 18 percent of their electricity from environmentally friendly sources within 15 years.\Under the bill, the state will have eight times more so-called ""green"" energy - most of it wind power - than it does now, said John Hanger, president of the environmental group PennFuture.\Almost half of that amount would come from wind turbines, solar panels and methane gas emitted by decomposing trash in landfills. The rest would come from a second ""tier"" that includes garbage incinerators, ""waste"" coal and energy efficiency.\Supporters, including Rendell - who said he would sign the bill - believe the green energy would not cost consumers any more than traditional sources and would be a plus for the state's economy and the environment.\Philadelphia-based Peco Energy Co. was among the supporters, after its analysis showed that the bill would not raise rates for customers at least through 2010, spokesman Michael Wood said.\The state already comes close to meeting the target for the second-tier sources - most of it from waste coal, said John Hanger, a former member of the Public Utility Commission.\The bill sparked a rare schism among the environmental movement. Hanger praised it as ""revolutionary,"" while several groups decried the inclusion of incinerators and waste coal.\""These are just inherently dirty resources and they shouldn't be included in an alternative energy standard,"" said Nathan Willcox, an energy advocate at the group PennEnvironment.\Waste coal is the term for coal that is not pure enough to be burned in typical power plants. As of December 2003, at least 258 million tons of waste coal sat in unsightly piles across the state, threatening water quality, according to the Department of Environmental Protection.\Environmentalists also are concerned about the effects of a bill authorizing the spending of $250 million for sewer and water projects, which was approved by voters last May.

Businesses would then buy and sell permits to emit the gasses.\Hawkins says the proposal would provide opportunities for economic growth.\Michaels says the proposal would lead to job losses in mining, trucking railroad and other industries.\""Cap and trade is a very difficult issue to discuss,"" said UC President Ed Welch, who will moderate the debate. ""One side says that cap and trade would devastate the economy of West Virginia, while the other side believes that without it we will destroy our environment. I hope we can have a real dialogue on what cap-and-trade proposals mean to West Virginia.""\The Rotary Club of Charleston is organizing the debate, which is open to the public. The Charleston Gazette and Charleston Daily Mail are the event's main sponsors."
13,"Just a year ago, ""cap-and-trade"" was about to save the planet from being cooked by global warming, if only we in Congress could recognize the threat and embrace the elegant solution.\That was then. Now the brave, new economic system that was supposed to cap carbon dioxide emissions and let emitters buy and sell allowances in a government market that mimics capitalism is proving to be less a solution than a problem. Even the Congress-knows-\best crowd is admitting that they can't figure out how to make it work, and cap-and-trade's most avid proponent in the House - Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) - indicates that she may not get around to legislating this year, after all.\Her California colleague, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D), pushed a cap-and-trade bill that has turned out to be a window on the difficulties. By some estimates, it would cut America's gross domestic product by 2.3 percent inside of seven years and raise average energy costs for households by $1,740 per year within 12 years. In the Midwest and Great Plains, the added cost for a household tops $2,000, and in Texas and Oklahoma, it's more than $3,000. \We don't have to see very far ahead to observe what's wrong, though. We can look to Europe right now and notice a cap-and-trade system that was created to meet emission reduction goals under the Kyoto accords. Not only won't the goals be met, both emissions and the cost of electricity are increasing. Germany, for example, has achieved a 30 percent hike in the cost of wholesale electricity, along with a bulge in unemployment to 9.5 percent. Higher emissions, higher prices and higher unemployment are not the results I want to emulate in the United States. I've accepted the European lesson that prosperity is at risk under cap-and-trade, and maybe Democrats are starting to recognize it, too.\Global warming is a trillion-dollar problem, and we've always taken it seriously on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Under Republican and then Democratic leadership, we have been assembling a remarkably thorough record of facts and views from experts.\The more we learn, the more I believe we need to apply a common-sense test to any lawmaking that might follow: We want to keep the lights on; we don't want the cost of using energy to bankrupt working people; we want them to drive what they want to drive and go where they need to go; and above all, we want them to keep their jobs. \America has big energy challenges in the next 20 years. Electricity production must grow by at least 40 percent. The demand for motor and aviation fuels is expected to increase 1 percent to 3 percent a year, and the requirement for natural gas to heat our homes, cook our food and fuel our industry is headed up. That's why I welcomed the agreement between BP and ConocoPhillips to build a new natural gas pipeline from Alaska. We've gotten by with the same gas supply levels for a decade, and you can see it in the cost of heating a house even after a 19 percent demand reduction by industrial gas users. \In short, life and prosperity in America require energy, and we've got large domestic reserves of it right here in the neighborhood. Maybe that's the most important aspect of the pipeline agreement - it's a move to be self-reliant instead of betting more of our future on energy from across the oceans.\Another problem with adopting a cap-and-trade program for the United States is that even if we want one, it is very unlikely that developing nations would do the same. Some argue that America needs to cap emissions unilaterally because doing so will inspire the world's big polluters like China and India to follow us. China, the planet's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, isn't interested. Each year, China adds more coal-fired electricity generation than all the power in Texas, and Texas is the U.S. leader in electricity generation.\China is committed to raising its enormous population from poverty, and it has given every indication that it intends to stick with the current policy of breakneck economic development and job creation. China argues that it has the right to grow and raise its standard of living closer to ours, and if we want to reduce worldwide emissions, we should do it by ourselves.\In summary, cap-and-trade works badly in Europe, is DOA in Asia and makes no economic sense in America. \So what's the answer? We could begin by not abandoning hope and trying to tell people all the things they can't do - can't drive to work, can't turn on the lights, can't ... well, you name it. Contrary to the frenzied reporting on the subject, the science of global warming is not settled, carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and prosperity is not evil. But if we ultimately decide that some kind of action makes sense, let's start by helping our people find ways to succeed instead explaining all the things they'll no longer be permitted to do. \I, for one, haven't given up on the quaint idea that innovation and ingenuity will respond to consumer demand in a free market. Washington is full of talk about the rise of ""green-collar"" jobs, but nearly everybody here thinks a green-collar worker is a government employee. \The trick for policymakers, scientists and industry will be to get new, low-\carbon technologies out of the laboratory and into homes, cars and businesses by inventing products and services to sell instead of rules to impose.\We all want a clean environment, and I believe we can have one. I also believe we can have economic prosperity and job growth if we use market forces, not government mandates, to join the two together.\Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) is ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee."
14,"WHEN Congress returns from its summer recess, the U.S. Senate is expected to begin consideration of the House Bill 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, otherwise known as ""cap and trade.""\While the House of Representatives narrowly passed (219-212) this legislation at the end of June, I am thankful that West Virginia's three representatives - Alan Mollohan, Shelley Moore Capito and Nick Rahall - stood up for our state and voted against this.\Now it is time for Sens. Robert Byrd and Jay Rockefeller to work to defeat this proposal once and for all.\Byrd already has come out and has stated his opposition to HR 2454, and Rockefeller has said he has ""serious reservations.""\This is good news, but they need to go further. The West Virginia Chamber of Commerce urges our senators to fight against this legislation on the Senate floor and to exercise their clout and seniority to defeat this legislation.\The bill would severely hurt West Virginia by threatening the economic use of coal, establishing even more burdensome federal regulations, piling new costs on state manufacturers and businesses, and imposing a new tax on everyone.\Here are some unnerving statistics about House bill 2454, from a study prepared recently by the National Association of Manufacturers. The measure would:\* Cause an estimated 2.4 million jobs to be lost by 2030, which will result in a 6 percent to 7 percent drop in domestic manufacturing jobs.\* Reduce industrial input by 5.3 percent to 6.5 percent by 2030.\* Raise electricity prices between 31 percent and 50 percent by 2030.\* Drop coal production by 38 percent by 2020 and up to 75 percent by 2030..\* Cause a decline in annual American household income of between $730 and $1,248\This report shows West Virginia will be one of 15 states disproportionately impacted by passage of HR 2454. This is a very high price to pay for legislation that does more to provide for ""income redistribution"" than to help the environment.\While employers appreciate the various points of view surrounding climate change and environmental issues, how Congress addresses this matter will have a bearing on our state's overall well-being, on our jobs, on our families' incomes, and on energy costs.\The West Virginia chamber, along with other national groups, suggests that climate change should be addressed as part of an overall energy strategy that balances a number of issues, including sustaining a healthy economy, encouraging better use of energy, and nurturing investments in our existing energy industry and in new technologies:\* Efficiency: We must find more ways to encourage energy consumers and producers to use fuel and power more efficiently by improving building designs and appliance standards, and by improving our electricity and transportation infrastructure.\* Technology: Government and businesses should promote investment in and use of new technologies that use traditional sources more cleanly and examine how we can incorporate emerging and alternative energies as part of our nation's energy production portfolio.\* Global action: The United States should exert strong, inclusive global leadership to conclude a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol that emphasizes technology, efficiency, and flexibility and includes ALL greenhouse gas emitters.\West Virginians will be hurt severely by HR 2454 and by the continued, ludicrous attacks on our nation's affordable, abundant energy supplies.\Think of the results here in West Virginia of what the House of Representatives is proposing - significant increases in electricity prices; devastation of our energy sector; the loss of thousands of mining and manufacturing jobs; cuts in schools, public safety, community services, and health care; and the loss of millions and millions in tax revenues.\Worse, if we continue to restrict domestic production and impose new costs and hardships on industries and businesses, then America as a whole will be less competitive, jobs and investment will continue to go overseas - and we will be more dependent on foreign supplies of energy.\HR 2454 is a recipe for disaster.\Now is the time to speak up for our state's future and to defend our livelihoods. The U.S. Senate needs to defeat this legislation."
15,"Supporters of cap-and-trade climate change legislation are looking to the unfolding Senate floor debate this week to map out how the sweeping bill can be enacted into law during the next Congress and under a new president.\""This is why we have to get started, because it won't happen in a day,"" said Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who last month acknowledged that the bill faces an uphill fight. ""It's a very long road to get this done.""\Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Energy Independence and Global Warming Committee, similarly conceded last week that a cap-and-trade bill he introduced on Wednesday faces long odds. Still, he said, the effort must get under way.\""We must move as far as we can to put together the best ideas to save the planet,"" he said. ""We must have legislation ready for the next president.""\The comments by Boxer and Markey underscore the silver lining cap-and-trade supporters see in the current debate: Don't despair if legislation stalls this year because a more favorable political climate lies just around the corner. \While President Bush remains opposed to mandatory controls for reducing greenhouse gases, all three leading presidential candidates support cap-and-trade, under which the government caps annual emissions and issues tradable permits that create a financial incentive to reduce pollution.\""The debate, starting Jan. 20 of next year, will no longer be between 'yes' and 'no,'"" Markey said. ""It will be between different types of 'yeses.'"" \Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) was one of the first Senators to introduce cap-and-trade legislation, although he is cool to the proposal being debated in the Senate this week -- the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act (S. 3036), which he says does not go far enough to encourage nuclear power. Nuclear is touted by some policymakers because it does not produce greenhouse emissions.\Both Democratic presidential contenders, Sens. Barack Obama (Ill.) and Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.), support the bill, and they are also co-sponsors of another cap-and-trade measure with even more stringent emissions-reduction targets than the Lieberman-Warner bill has. Lieberman-Warner aims to lower emissions to roughly 70 percent below current levels by 2050. \In contrast, McCain last month endorsed a slightly lower overall emissions goal -- at least 66 percent below 2005 levels by 2050. That calculus will affect Boxer's strategy moving forward in the next Congress, when she hopes to draft a bill with the new administration.\""Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton want a stronger bill. McCain wants a weaker bill,"" she noted last month. ""Whoever's in the White House, we'll have to sit down and write a bill, hopefully together, that we'll be able to move.""\The November elections could also ease passage if predictions of Democratic gains in the House and Senate prove accurate. \But Democrats are unlikely to try to freeze their Republican counterparts out of the process.\Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.), who along with House Energy and Commerce Chairman John Dingell (D-Mich.) is drafting a cap-and-trade bill that they hope to bring to the House floor this year, said recently that the two of them ""believe a bipartisan measure is essential for a program of this scope and complexity."" \However, Boucher acknowledged that the bill's drafting has been held up by a lack of cooperation by some Republicans on the Energy Committee, who fear the economic impact of adopting a cap-and-trade scheme.\In the runup to the Lieberman-Warner debate, Senate Republicans similarly highlighted economic fears of the bill's price tag, which by some estimates could cost upward of several trillion dollars by 2030 while further exacerbating rising energy costs. \To address those concerns, Boxer last month unveiled a substitute amendment that includes a new $800 billion tax relief fund to help consumers pay higher energy costs expected to result from the bill. The new bill also details trillions of dollars, expected to be raised from auctioning emission allocations, that will be steered to help workers and industry sectors adjust to a new carbon-constrained economy. \However, Republicans are eying the revenue raised by the cap-and-trade program to provide additional tax relief to consumers. Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) last week signaled he will press amendments to return the funds to taxpayers. \""They should be used to lower other taxes for American families rather than increasing the size of government through new programs,"" he said.\Other Republican amendments to the bill will seek to soften its economic impact through cost-containment mechanisms, promote new energy technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and encourage new nuclear power generation.\Possible Democratic amendments could try to tighten the bill's emission-reduction schedule, increase the auctioning of emission allocations and seek a lead role for the United States in international climate talks. Provisions to encourage greenhouse gas reductions in China, India and other developing nations will be a source of contention, too.\The success of such amendments this week will provide a baseline reading on what might be included in a bill taken up next year. While Boxer is on guard for ""poison pill"" amendments to weaken the bill, she said she welcomes an extended debate on a range of issues, adding that it will guide future legislative efforts.\""It's really important for us to get a measure as to where people are,"" she said."
16,"Re: ""Cap-and-trade can help environment, local economy,"" Bob Janes, May 21. Commissioner Janes tries to explain a very confusing issue of an unproven, at best, theory will slow global warming. First, all scientific information shows that for the last 10 years our planet has been cooling. But Commissioner Janes has bought in to the political rhetoric of the likes of Al Gore, whose theories, book and movie have been proven wrong.\Mr. Janes recognizes that there will be an increase in energy rates (a hidden tax,) but says it will be offset with federal assistance money. Just where does he think federal money comes from?\With the present economy and out of control spending by our Congress there is no money for this in the first place. Unless, of course, you raise taxes to get it.\It is on his watch that they want to build a stadium for the Boston Red Sox with county money they don't have. Cap-and-trade is nothing more than tax-and-spend policies that have led to the budget shortfall in Lee County.\ALBERT SENEGETO\Fort Myers\New tax scheme\I was very disturbed by Commissioner Bob Janes' guest opinion supporting cap-and-trade. If he truly believes that cap-and-trade will benefit Lee County and small businesses I have serious doubts about his wisdom.\Global warming caused by human activity is far from a fact and more scientists contest it than support it. This scheme is merely an energy tax and will cost the average citizen and business many thousands of dollars each year. He claims that federal assistance money will offset costs passed down to the consumers. Where does he think the feds will get the money? What strings will be attached to the funds?\Career politicians like him have never made a payroll or struggled to keep a business going. They continue to tax and spend like there is no end in sight. Business people in this community and across the country are waking up to the reality that we must do something to protect our freedom and our children's future from the excesses of our elected officials.\The recent vote in California and the tea parties are a hopeful sign that in the next election we will reverse this march to socialism by cleaning house and defeating candidates like Bob Janes.\ROBERT PEASE\Fort Myers\Check nuclear power\Global warming is a questionable proposition; we actually may be in a period of global cooling. No matter which, it is further questionable as to what contribution to change will be made by Americans destroying our economy in an attempt to abide by some bureaucratic emissions rules from Washington.\Ultimately, the government will be empowered to enforce regulations through penalties, fines and litigation. The cost will be enormous in dollars as well as loss of jobs by every business or activity that consumes fossil fuel or emits CO2. The loss of individual liberty will be even greater. How about me, I breath out CO2, will I be required to breathe less in the name of saving the planet? Or perhaps just declared expendable as a senior citizen?\Commissioner Janes should go back to studying this issue a little deeper than just guessing that cap-and-trade might bring a few jobs to Lee County doing research on wishful thinking technology. Actually the solution is already known - it's called nuclear-generated power, but the socialist enviro-nut cases ignore this.\The sound you hear from overseas is our competitors laughing at us as they crank up their smoky factories.\NEIL MILLER\North Fort Myers\Odd priorities?\I find it irresponsible of Commissioner Judah to be unaware of the garbage problem at Manna Mobile Home Park. According The News-Press' story this is the ""first he has heard about the problem."" Perhaps if he were to physically visit the poorest areas in his district, he would have heard of it before. I don't even live in that area and I'm aware of it.\On the same page of the paper, Mr. Judah shows concern for a shark fishing festival at Fort Myers Beach. The unfortunate impression this gives is that Mr. Judah is concerned for the well-being of swimmers and beachgoers at the relatively affluent Fort Myers Beach area, but not the hungry people living in filth at the mobile home park. Perhaps this is untrue, but if Mr. Judah would pay more attention to the poor and unrepresented, which is part of his job, we wouldn't receive that impression.\Also, how about letting the town of Fort Myers Beach worry about the festival? And if they really do donate the shark meat, then how is it any different than a private citizen catching a shark and filleting it for dinner? As long as they don't go over the legal limit, there shouldn't be a problem anyway.\TOBI CAMPBELL\Fort Myers\You go try a hook\It's ridiculous that so many are celebrating the now ""no-kill"" shark tournament. I'm tired of people patting themselves on the back when they use ""catch and release"" instead of outright killing. Catch and release is nothing more than a form of glorified torture and many times the fish does not survive. Why do so many people enjoy killing and torturing other living creatures? What do you get out of it? Does it make you feel like a big tough person?\Same goes with those who participate in the annual mullet toss on Pine Island. It's embarrassing that this Neanderthal-like behavior still exists in the area. Instead of catch and release, how about leaving the sharks alone and just celebrate the fact that there are still some in existence. Have a coconut toss instead of killing a fish just to use as some sort of sick entertainment. For those of you who will incorrectly suggest that a fish feels no pain (that used to be said about dogs and cats, too), I recommend that you take a large fish hook, ram it through the side of your mouth and then judge whether or not it hurts.\MAMIE HOLST\Fort Myers\Outstanding work\I would like to take this time to commend Officer T. J. McCormick, of the Fort Myers Police Department, for coming to the aid of a family member who was recently in a crisis situation. My son, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia eight years ago, was in unquestionable need of immediate medical attention. This officer was not only proficient in his line of work; he emphatically knew how to handle the situation.\The enormity of compassion and empathy he displayed was tremendous. In light of so much negativity towards the police department, sharing my experience may change the public's perspective of the many fine officers who do assist us in time of need. Once again, thank you, Officer T. J. McCormick. I am forever grateful and recognition should be given to you for your humanitarianism.\CHERYL ZUBRYCKY\Fort Myers"
17," Re ""EPA Aims to Combat Dirty Air With Trading Systems,"" Dec. 5: I am astonished that the Bush administration would cut the effective plans of the Clinton administration to drastically reduce emissions of mercury from power plants and instead propose a ""cap and trade"" program that would allow individual power plants to buy the right to highly pollute their local communities and environments. Is anyone in the federal government looking out for the welfare of ordinary Americans?\ Jonathan Matthews\ Valley Village"
18," Washington --- A group of senators introduced a resolution Wednesday to block a Bush administration plan that environmentalists say coddles industries responsible for mercury pollution.\ At issue is an Environmental Protection Agency move to install an industry-backed ""cap-and-trade"" plan in which power companies could buy and sell allowances for releasing mercury into the air from coal- burning power plants.\ Alarmed at evidence of fetal brain damage caused when pregnant women are exposed to mercury, more than 600,000 Americans have contacted the EPA in recent years, objecting to plans to set up the pollution-swapping system.\ Although supporters of the Senate resolution acknowledged that it may never pass, the measure has more than enough sponsors --- 32 --- to force a vote by the full Senate.\ An identical resolution was introduced late Wednesday in the House, with five co-sponsors, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California.\ ""It will be an uphill fight, but this is our best opportunity to hold senators accountable on this very important issue,"" said Felice Stadler, a mercury specialist at the National Wildlife Federation.\ Spokesmen for electric power interests that lobbied hard for the cap-and-trade plan ridiculed the resolution.\ Scott Segal, head of a lobbying organization that represents Southern Co. and other coal-burning utilities, called it ""yet another attempt to gum up the works of mercury regulation in the United States.""\ ""Even though the senators argue for faster regulation of mercury emissions, today's petition is a recipe for delay and uncertainty in federal mercury policy, much to the detriment of the American people,"" said Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council.\ Dan Riedinger, spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for the electric power industry, said the stringent regulation anticipated in the Clinton administration declaration would not have held up in court.\ ""Had the agency adhered to this plan as critics of the current rule would have preferred, the resulting regulation would have fallen in the courts like a house of cards in a hurricane,"" he said.\ EPA spokeswoman Eryn Witcher said the resolution ""threatens to delay the world's first mercury regulation on power plants --- a regulation that will cut harmful emissions by 70 percent nationwide.\ ""EPA and the Bush administration continue to feel strongly that we must act now to effectively reduce mercury emissions from power plants,"" she said.\ If passed by both the House and Senate, the resolution would overturn a regulation that the EPA used to rescind a Clinton administration declaration requiring reduction of mercury emissions from coal-burning electric power plants.\ The Senate ""resolution of disapproval"" was introduced Wednesday under the Congressional Review Act, a law passed as part of the Republican Contract with America to give Congress a simple means of vetoing regulations imposed by federal agencies.\ Chief sponsors were Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Susan Collins (R- Maine) and James Jeffords, a Vermont independent. Senators from California, Hawaii, Oregon, Minnesota and other states signed on as co-sponsors.\ Complaining that Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman James Inhofe (R-Okla.) had refused to hold ""a single hearing"" on the EPA mercury rule, Leahy said the administration and Senate Republican leaders had tried ""to avoid any public daylight"" on the matter.\ ""Their aim is to keep the public in the dark, and I would guess that most Americans in fact do not know what EPA and the big polluters have been up to with this rule.""\ Senate rules require a floor vote on the resolution if 30 senators request it.\ CAPTION: KEN CEDENO / Bloomberg News Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) says the Bush administration and Republican leaders are trying ""to keep the public in the dark"" on the mercury emissions plan."
19,"The Obama administration plans to push ahead with efforts to aggressively limit greenhouse gas emissions and fight global warming despite fears that it could further slow the recessionary economy.\Instead of backing away, the administration plans to portray the limits as a boost for America's ""clean energy economy,"" according to congressional leaders and energy experts who have talked with top Obama advisers. The step would spur competitiveness and promote investment in renewable alternatives to imported oil, the government will argue.\At issue is the so-called cap-and-trade initiative, under which the government would set limits on carbon emissions by power plants, factories and other installations but allow those that emit more to buy or trade permits with companies and facilities that emit less than the prescribed limit.\The idea is that raising the cost of pumping more carbon into the atmosphere would encourage companies and other emitters to cut back, thus reducing a principle cause of global warming.\""If we don't put a price on carbon,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, ""we'll never get these clean energy sources online.""\But cap-and-trade would amount to a tax, raising energy costs. And several independent studies have suggested that emissions limits could be a drag on economic growth, a concern raised frequently by opponents of climate change legislation.\""The whole economic issue will be front and center in the debate on this,"" said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, who has discussed President Barack Obama's global warming plans with senior administration officials ""on both sides.""\Polls show voters increasingly losing interest in the global warming issue. By pressing ahead anyway, Obama would be sticking with a program he said during the campaign would be a high priority of his presidency.\""There's a general consensus that things are going to be done with climate"" in Washington this year, said Daniel Yergin, author of the Pulitzer-winning ""The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power,"" who recently updated his book with an epilogue on Obama and energy.\He added: ""We're going to go through a very intense national seminar on cap-and-trade and carbon tax.""\Details of the administration's approach are far from set, though Obama has repeatedly said he favors cap-and-trade. The administration will argue that greenhouse gas restrictions should be part of a two-pronged effort to stimulate renewable energy supplies and ensure demand for the megawatts they'd produce.\The first part is to invest heavily in wind power, solar power and biofuels, through the massive stimulus bill working its way through Congress. The second is to help that power compete with cheaper fossil fuels by pumping up fossil fuels' costs to reflect the potential economic damage from a warmed Earth.\Critics, including many Republicans on Capitol Hill, say those moves will only increase energy prices and hurt already-struggling families.\""I just have concerns on the impact on the economy with all of the issues of global climate change,"" said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), who sits on the Senate's energy and environment committees, ""and what restrictions there's going to be, what expenses there's going to be for American taxpayers.\Economists generally agree that limiting emissions is likely to curb economic growth, at least in the short term. Peter Orszag, the former head of the Congressional Budget Office who now heads the White House Office of Management and Budget, told Congress last year that emissions limits would reduce long-term economic risks but ""also impose costs on the economy ... in the form of higher prices for energy and energy-intensive goods.""\Orszag also testified that the size of those costs could depend on whether the government sells emissions permits, and if so, how it spends the proceeds.\Environmentalists have recently pushed that idea one step further, arguing that if Congress passed emissions caps today, it could borrow against the future revenues from permit sales and spend the money on alternative-energy research and technology.\That would stimulate the economy and ""allow polluters to transition from a high-polluting environment to a low-polluting environment,"" said Andy Stevenson, a former hedge fund manager who is now a finance adviser for the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York.\Other experts are more skeptical. Subsidizing alternative energy could stimulate the economy, said Robert Shapiro, an economic adviser to former President Bill Clinton and now chairman of the U.S. Climate Task Force. But a cap-and-trade system, he said, ""would raise energy prices at a time when you're trying to increase consumption. ... It goes against everything [Obama] campaigned on.\Shapiro and many economists would prefer for the government to tax carbon emissions and refund the proceeds straight to taxpayers. The Democratic leaders working with Obama on climate legislation prefer cap-and-trade. So do a coalition of business leaders -- including Shell oil and the Big Three automakers -- who joined with some environmental groups to release an emissions-limit proposal earlier this month.\Boxer said Friday that she has learned from the defeat of a cap-and-trade bill in the Senate last year. She's set to unveil basic principles of a simpler, more focused plan within a week in hopes of passing a bill by year's end.\Her counterpart on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) talks even more optimistically: He has promised a bill by Memorial Day.\----------\jtankersley@tribune.com\Get green news at one site\Tribune's Green page has news about recycling, jobs and getting eco-friendly at chicagotribune.com/green\Credit: By Jim Tankersley, Washington Bureau"

\
The economic meltdown, energy crisis and global warming are interconnected, and so are the solutions. By implementing the right policies, we can create jobs, secure our energy independence and power capacity, and protect natural resources for our future.
\
But we need a long-term strategy that provides better energy choices by driving investments to build, deliver and install clean energy solutions. We need energy policies that will support both a U.S. auto industry and other manufacturing and that are vibrant, competitive, technologically advanced and an integral part of the solution to global warming.
\
The cap-and-trade legislation will help take a balanced approach toward an economy-wide program that prevents foreign competitors from getting advantages over America companies. The nation should maintain a diverse energy portfolio that includes renewable energy, fossil fuels, nuclear and hydro electric. And solutions must protect individual industries and geographical regions from being disproportionably or adversely affected.
\
Such a strategy is the American Clean Energy &amp; Security Act, which is in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which will help to create millions of new clean-energy jobs, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, encourage the development of cleaner, cheaper sources of energy, and dramatically cut the carbon pollution that causes global warming.
\
The historic changes in the legislation -- also known as the Waxman-Markey bill -- come with risks, and we must work to balance bettering the environment with job creation.
\
The Michigan congressional delegation has been working hard to protect and promote the auto industry, including garnering $50 billion in low-interest loans for automakers to retool their production facilities. U.S. Rep. John Dingell, D-Dearborn, deserves credit for leading the fight to secure 3 percent of the revenue from the auctioning of carbon emission permits, worth an estimated $10 billion to $20 billion over the next 20 years, for the auto industry to develop advanced technology vehicles.
\
Two labor-environmental groups, the Blue Green Alliance and Apollo Alliance, support this legislation.
\
We have seen other examples of trade unions working to both protect jobs and better our environment. Recently, union leaders stood with President Barack Obama when he announced new fuel-economy and tailpipe emission standards. This was truly an historic achievement, bringing together labor, industry, environmentalists and government in support of a comprehensive and consistent national policy.
\
While the resulting standards are aggressive, calling for a 30 percent improvement in fuel efficiency by 2016, they are achievable within the time lines proposed. And they can help to spur a renaissance in the American auto industry, creating new jobs as manufacturers restructure to build the clean energy vehicles of the future.
\
Creating a clean energy economy will be good for Michigan with the potential of thousands of new, well-paying jobs. According to the Michigan Department of Energy, Labor and Economic Development's ""green jobs"" report, from 2005 to 2008, more than 2,500 green jobs were added to Michigan's economy, a growth rate of 7.7 percent.
\
Green jobs also pay well; 13 of the top 15 sectors of green employment have weekly wages above the overall private sector weekly average. The Steel Workers union reminds us that each wind turbine built contain 250 tons of steel and thousands of machined parts.
\
We have an opportunity to rebuild our economy with millions of clean energy jobs, retool manufacturing, increase our energy independence and preserve the planet for future generations. It is time for the leaders in Washington to take the bold, forward-looking action that we need by passing the Waxman-Markey bill.

"
21,"Scientific opinion regarding the primary cause of global climate change is now deeply solidified - temperatures are rising, and human activity is the major contributor to the temperature increases. Congress must now act to address the challenge that climate change poses. \In the near future, the subcommittee I chair will advance for consideration by the House a mandatory control program for greenhouse gases. It will rely on the time-tested cap-and-trade methodology that we employed successfully in 1990 to control sulfur dioxide emissions. My goal in drafting the measure will be to protect\both the environment and the domestic economy. Legislation achieving this necessary balance will be difficult to craft, but it can be done.\There are certain components that will be critical to the formation of the program. It must be mandatory, and it must be economy-wide. It must have a bipartisan foundation and be \industry-supported, similar to each of the preceding major clean air enactments, all of which passed both chambers with large bipartisan majorities. Each CO2-emitting sector must contribute to the solution, and we must ensure that each sector has the tools necessary to do so.\Certain realities must be acknowledged. Our nation's primary source of electricity is our most abundant natural resource - coal. It accounts for 51 percent of electricity generation, with the Department of Energy estimating that coal use will grow to 57 percent in 2030. For the stability of our economy, coal must continue to be the major component of our fuel mix.\Coal is by far the least expensive fuel and we have a 250-year reserve of it in the U.S., the largest of any nation. We have no readily available fuel alternatives. Nuclear plants are being proposed but take years to build. Renewables are cost competitive only in select parts of the country that have an abundance of wind or solar resources. Natural gas is the next least expensive fuel, but we are already importing a significant portion of our daily consumption. If the utilities now burning coal switch to natural gas, the economy would be deeply dislocated. Prices would soar. Gas-dependent industries would suffer, and the 58 percent of homes in America heated with natural gas would experience severe financial distress. This deep economic harm can and must be avoided.\The key to our ability to impose carbon constraints without a radical and economically damaging change in the existing fuel mix is to hasten the development of CO2-capture-and-sequestration technologies. \CO2-capture technologies, such as integrated gasification combined cycle, oxygen-based combustion and retrofits for existing coal-fired plants using chilled ammonia, will soon enter the commercial market. These technologies for CO2 separation will be available in a few years. The technology challenge will be the identification of reliable and available storage caverns for CO2 sequestration. Sites must be thoroughly mapped, pressurized with CO2 and monitored for years to ensure their integrity before they can be certified for commercial use. Under current estimates, that work will not be completed until approximately 2025. \While the injection of carbon dioxide for enhanced oil and gas recovery has occurred for some time, oil and gas fields can accommodate only a small fraction of the billions of tons of CO2 that a cap-and-trade program will necessitate. Many other forms of storage media in diverse locations around the nation must be extensively evaluated, and legal issues surrounding sequestration must be resolved. Last year, a Department of Energy study reported that the U.S. has sufficient geological reserves to accommodate the injection of 900 years of carbon dioxide emissions. But preparing the storage sites will be expensive and will take time. \The recent MIT study ""The Future of Coal"" recommends federal government expenditures of approximately $460 million annually over about the next 10 years in order to bring carbon-capture-and-storage technologies to commercial use. Other estimates of the amount required range upward of $10 billion over the next decade. Appropriations would have to exceed current sums by orders of magnitude to meet these estimates. The preservation of national economic stability requires that any mandatory control program be accompanied by a corresponding financial commitment by government to this technical challenge. \In order to be digestible by our economy, the schedule for emissions reductions should impose the most severe reduction requirements beginning at the time CO2-capture-and-sequestration technologies become widely commercially available. However, significant reductions can be achieved even by coal-burning entities in the early years of the program while the sequestration technologies are being developed. By ensuring that our program includes access to widely available credit offsets, such as domestic agricultural CO2 sinks and verifiable international offsets from tropical rainforest protection, we can offer an affordable means by which emission reductions can be required and achieved in the near term.\In addition to investments in technology and the use of offsets to help facilitate near-term reductions, we must also ensure that the United States and the balance of the developed world are not alone in their efforts to solve this global problem. We must ensure that other nations - notably China and India - also institute greenhouse gas emission control programs or in reliable ways compensate for the CO2 emissions associated with items they export to the United States. Without developing nation participation, the imposition of controls by the United States could have a detrimental effect on our industries that are exposed to global trade. \Several interesting ideas have been proposed for ways in which we can use U.S. trade laws to ensure that our legislation will lead to international participation, such as tying emission credits to each item imported into the United States or establishing manufacturing performance standards for every product exported to our shores. Regardless of the specific approach, our program will contain a mechanism to ensure that we meet the dual goals of decreasing greenhouse gas emissions while protecting domestic entities that participate in energy intensive, globally competitive industries. \A number of other factors will be critical to the development of our program, and there are many details that will be developed as we craft our legislation. As the process moves forward, our goals will be to achieve the scientifically recommended emissions reductions of approximately 60 percent to 80 percent by 2050 while preventing economic disruption. \Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.) is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality."
22,"In just a couple of days, the U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote on a Climate Security Act.\This bill, sponsored by Sens. Joseph Lieberman and John Warner, seeks to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions 63 percent by 2050, according to a fact sheet provided by representatives of the Florida Wildlife Federation and Florida Climate Project.\This would be made affordable by allowing companies to trade and save emission allowances.\That would involve some expense, but there also would be new opportunities for ""green"" enterprises.\More importantly, it would lessen global warming, which otherwise might take a terrible toll on humans and wildlife alike.\Cap and trade is a fancy way of producing a carbon tax. While it has worked well for certain pollutants, Congress might be better served to start this new venture on a trial basis.\The Wall Street Journal suspected in an editorial that it will become just an additional tax and wisely suggested it be used to replace taxes that restrict economic growth.\The goose that laid the golden egg is not the government, but the free enterprise system."

More economic tricks, gimmicks and derivatives are not going to solve a problem this big. Tax carbon directly if you must. Just get the prices right, and the rest will take care of itself.\Cap and trade programs are a proven way to achieve environmental standards and protect public health while providing flexibility to industries that seek market-based solutions.

24,"After Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) unseated Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) atop the Energy and Commerce Committee last year, conservative Democrats worried that Waxman and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) would try to ram through a politically toxic climate change bill.\But this week, Waxman and Subcommittee on Energy and Environment Chairman Ed Markey (D-Mass.) showed a pragmatic streak that appears close to lining up support from nearly all the panel's Democratic members.\The pair announced Tuesday night that they had compromised with party moderates to reach a breakthrough on the most difficult issues facing the bill and planned to unveil the text today. \Final details were still being negotiated Wednesday night, and Waxman and Markey met multiple times with Texas Democratic Reps. Gene Green and Charlie Gonzalez to try to cut a deal on limiting the effect on the oil refining industry.\""I'm feeling pretty good right now,"" Markey said Wednesday afternoon. ""It's down on the 10-yard line.""\To be sure, the political calculus for the legislation remains dicey, with action in the Senate uncertain and Republicans unified in opposition.\But the deal appears to have substantially improved chances for quick House action that backers hope will prompt the Senate to act.\""Everybody thought health care was going to happen and energy was just going to sit there,"" a Democratic leadership aide said. ""I think they did what was necessary to earn the trust and respect of the Caucus, and that's a major accomplishment considering the diversity and regional differences.""\Markey said the critics and doubters on the outside weren't aware of the progress being made behind the scenes in recent months.\""Those who were predicting the demise of the bill never understood the dynamic inside our committee,"" Markey said. ""Every Democratic member of the committee is committed to bringing clean energy jobs to their district. ... All of the Members wanted to get to 'yes.'""\Markey predicted that most, if not all, of the Democrats on the committee will sign onto the bill and ultimately be the ambassadors to the rest of the Democratic Caucus as they push to bring it to a House vote this summer.\Waxman and Markey had one thing going for them from the start - strong support from a large coalition of corporations that often oppose environmental legislation, including several major oil companies and utilities.\""When Edison Electric Institute's CEO endorsed the bill, when three of the largest oil companies support the bill, when the second-largest coal company supports the bill, when [General Electric] and dozens of Fortune 100 companies endorse the bill, that will be the answer to the critics who say it will hurt the economy,"" Markey said. \""The hardest thing was to convince people that we could do it, because that's the beginning of real discussions,"" Markey said. ""There were so many people of the opinion that nothing was going to happen until they came into our process. ... We had to dispel conventional wisdom.""\Polling results presented to Democrats on Tuesday night showing strong public support for clean energy legislation that reduces dependence on imported oil also helps the bill's chances, Markey said.\The compromises reached this week also are aimed at minimizing costs for consumers and protecting manufacturers facing the potential for costs not shared by their overseas competitors - two of the biggest criticisms of the scheme.\Instead of the 100 percent auctions that President Barack Obama proposed during his campaign, Waxman and Markey agreed to initially give away most of the carbon emission permits for free in an effort to prevent economic disruptions or a surge in electric rates.\And in negotiations with Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.), Waxman agreed to a 17 percent cut in carbon emissions in 2020, instead of the 20 percent that he had sought, which Boucher, who hails from coal country, had feared would outpace technologies like carbon capture from coal-fired power plants. \The renewable electricity standard was trimmed to 20 percent by 2020, although as much as 8 percent could come from efficiency improvements, Markey said.\Backers of nuclear power, including Science and Technology Chairman Bart Gordon (D-Tenn.), Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), also got commitments for incentives for new nuclear plants as well, including an exemption from the renewable electricity requirements.\Members praised the apparent deal, while cautioning that they wanted to see it on paper before committing to it.\""I think they knew from the beginning that all of this would need to be addressed, and to the chairman's credit, they sat down with us,"" said Rep. Mike Doyle (D-Pa.), who has major steel interests in his district that would get free emissions credits. \""I have to give Mr. Markey a lot of credit,"" said Gonzalez, who praised him in particular for being open to technologies like nuclear power.\Not everybody was wholly satisfied, of course.\Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.) said he was still concerned that there wouldn't be enough revenue raised to insulate lower-income residents from the higher costs the plan would impose.\""The cost of everything is going to go up - electricity, food, plastics, rubber, autos - the cost of everything is going to go up,"" he said.\Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) said he wants language added to tightly regulate the trading of the credits to prevent speculation.\""I'm not for it unless we tighten this market,"" Stupak said. ""I just think there is a windfall for the speculators, and they can't wait."" \Republicans, meanwhile, appear to be hardening their opposition. Energy and Commerce ranking member Joe Barton (R-Texas) promised a fight at next week's markup, saying Republicans would ""never surrender"" on the issue of cap-and-trade, arguing that it is ""unilateral economic disarmament."""
25,"
California's landmark global-warming bill was a white-hot topic in the 2010 governor's race and remains former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's signature environmental achievement.
\
But as the state prepares to unroll the law's cap-and-trade program in November with the first state auctions of emissions permits, a new poll finds that 57 percent of Californians say they have never heard anything about the program.
\
The statewide poll by the Public Policy Institute of California further found that 30 percent of respondents said they had heard ""a little,"" while just 12 percent said they had heard ""a lot.""
\
""Cap-and-trade is a very complicated issue to the average Californian,"" said Mark Baldassare, president and CEO of the PPIC. ""It's not something that has been at the center of attention for them. Connecting the dots between cap-and-trade and global warming continues to be a challenge for policymakers.""
\
The cap-and-trade program sets lower limits on companies' greenhouse gas emissions and allows those who emit less than their cap to sell their unused capacity, in the form of permits, to those who exceed their limits.
\
The issues of climate change and energy policy have been largely absent in the presidential election, which has been dominated by the economy. But those issues remain important to Golden State voters: Seven in 10 likely voters in California say the candidates' positions on global warming and energy policy are important in determining their vote, according to the new poll. Thirty percent said the issue is very important, while 42 percent said it's somewhat important.
\
By a 54 to 33 percent, majorities of likely voters say they trust President Barack Obama more than Republican challenger Mitt Romney to handle global warming and energy policy. But among the 1,131 likely voters surveyed on the question of overall preference for president, Obama's margin over Romney was only 11 percentage points: 51 to 40 percent. That's far tighter than four years ago, when Obama carried California by a stunning 24 points.
\
But likely voters' preference for Obama on global warming and energy policy does not translate to support for his overall handling of environmental issues. Likely voters are split, with 46 percent approving and 46 percent disapproving of his handling of environmental issues.
\
""California voters have high standards when it comes to the environment,"" Baldassare said. ""They trust Obama more than Romney, but they don't feel Obama has done enough. A lot of enthusiasm for Obama has faded, particularly in the environmental arena.""
\
Asked to assess what government is doing to address global warming, 53 percent of likely voters say the federal government is not doing enough, while 23 percent say it is doing just enough; 21 percent say it is doing more than enough.
\
Nearly 8 in 10 Californians believe the world's temperature has been going up over the past 100 years, and 45 percent consider global warming a very serious threat to California's future.
\
A political battle is brewing in Sacramento over how the state, which expects to generate anywhere from $2 billion to $14 billion annually in new revenues from the permit auctions, will spend the money.
\
The PPIC poll found that 65 percent of Californians have very little or no confidence in the state to spend that money wisely.
\
Some members of the administration of Gov. Jerry Brown and the California High-Speed Rail Authority would like to use the revenue to make up for expected shortfalls in the $63 billion bullet-train project. The train, which would link San Francisco and Los Angeles, recently got the green light from the Legislature and Brown.
\
The Public Policy Institute of California surveyed 2,500 adults from July 10-24. The overall margin of error is plus or minus 2.9 percentage points, and 3.6 percentage points for just the 1,131 likely voters.

26,"Candidates for the 1st District congressional seat responded Sunday to a broad range of questions on environmental sustainability, ranging from global warming and alternative transportation to how highly they regard the environment.\Democrat Chellie Pingree and Republican Charlie Summers answered questions posed by moderator Irwin Gratz, host of Maine Public Radio's ""Morning Edition."" The forum was held in the library of the University of Southern Maine in Portland.\Questions were determined by forum sponsors - a group of Maine-based organizations concerned about the environment.\Both candidates said protecting Maine's environment would be a top priority if they are elected to Congress.\""I can't think of anything that would be a higher priority for me,"" Summers said. ""We all breathe the same air and drink the same water. And we all have a responsibility to ensuring we have a clean environment.""\Pingree pointed out that she is from an island community where one instance of pollution can affect the entire population.\""For me (protection of the environment), it's critical,"" Pingree said. ""It's an underpinning of my value system.""\On the issue of Mainers' reliance on heating oil - Gratz said Maine people spend more than $1.5 billion per year out-of-state to buy heating oil - Pingree said she'd like to see more funds spent on weatherization programs because such measures will save money in the long run.\Pingree also said she supports developing more alternative sources of energy, including wind power.\Summers said he would support offshore drillling, adding that every day the United States imports a barrel of oil, ""we are less secure.""\Summers said he would support legislation that would give a tax credit to people who purchase energy-efficient cars.\Gratz asked the candidates where they stood on cap-and-trade, a way for government to get large-scale polluters to gradually reduce carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions.\Summers and Pingree took different positions on a federal cap-and-trade program to reduce global warming pollution 80 percent by the year 2050.\""I don't support a cap-and-trade system,"" Summers said. ""All it does is allow someone to purchase the right to pollute. We need to punish bad behavior by discouraging companies from polluting.""\Pingree said she would support cap-and-trade agreements because they encourage economic growth while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. ""It is clearly one of the best ideas out there,"" she said.\The candidates were asked how they will ensure that the needs of bicyclists and pedestrians are met in the 2009 federal transportation bill.\Pingree, who described herself as an ""avid bicyclist,"" said she would like to see more people riding their bikes to work and on errands - especially in urban areas. She vowed to work toward putting more funds toward Amtrak and passenger rail service.\Summers said he is a ""huge fan and user"" of public transportation. But rather than have the government legislate alternative forms of transit, Summers called upon Americans to take the lead.\""We can't expect the government to do this for us. We have to be active participants in becoming an energy-independent country,"" he said.\Staff Writer Dennis Hoey can be contacted at 791-6365 or at:\dhoey@pressherald.com\Credit: By DENNIS HOEY Staff Writer"
27,"Who is responsible for maintaining and improving our environment? The answer, of course, is: We are. That's why the April 19 editorial, ""Cap-and-trade system is really a tax,"" by Hillsdale College Economics and Public Policy Professor Gary Wolfram, Ph.D., was surprising and difficult to understand.\Dr. Wolfram argues that the cap-and-trade system should be shelved because we are unable to measure the environmental cost per ton of carbon dioxide emission in comparison to the benefits we receive from fossil fuel-produced goods. This is like firemen not fighting fires because we haven't measured the property values of the structures in comparison to firefighting costs. In fighting fires, we use our taxes to pay the costs and take action. We accept our responsibility.\Alarms have sounded in recent years because atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and global temperatures are at record highs. Natural phenomenon, some beyond our control, can be the cause. The strong consensus among scientists, however, is that high CO2 levels, produced by human activity and over which we do have some control, are the cause of today's warming. We must reduce emissions. This is our responsibility. Consequences of inaction will be far greater than cap-and-trade system costs.\Glaciers worldwide are receding. Concern has been expressed that receding Himalayan glaciers will someday halt the water supply to major rivers in India and China. Economic and human impact would be devastating. The cost of a cap-and-trade system today, taking action now, assuming our responsibility to ourselves and to our planet, would not compare to the costs of such a disaster.\Increased ocean water acidity is another recent observation. Some absorbed CO2 is converted to carbonic acid. Shells collected today are significantly thinner than those measured in museum collections. Acidity, along with increased ocean water temperature, is the cause of observed coral bleaching. Some divers claim that action is unneeded because many reefs have never looked better. This is like the firemen saying not to worry about the fire in the kitchen since the living room looks great.\Dr. Wolfram points out that oil and natural gas companies and electric utilities will feel the greatest impact of a cap-and-trade system. Isn't this just as it should be? Action is going to require money. These companies, recording huge profits, are exactly where responsibility belongs. Incentives for alternative technologies and developments that reduce both emissions and costs are created. New jobs and employment opportunity will follow in the process. Cap-and-trade will stimulate economic growth.\Dr. Wolfram also points out that action to reduce emissions need not be taken because our improvements will be overwhelmed by emissions from China. This is like saying that we don't need to fight forest fires in Colorado because fires are going to be worse in Idaho. Also, we abdicate our leadership role, lose research and development opportunity and, through inaction, discard our voice for an improved environment.\Dr. Wolfram's editorial, ""Cap-and-trade system is really a tax,"" makes no reference to environmental responsibility. This is surprising and difficult to understand. Cap-and-trade is really an investment.\Robert Learner of Battle Creek is retired director of Kingman Museum of Natural History."
28,"In the 1960s, a University of Wisconsin graduate student named Thomas Crocker came up with a novel solution for environmental problems: cap emissions of pollutants and then let firms trade permits that allow them to pollute within those limits.\Now legislation using cap-and-trade to limit greenhouse gases is working its way through Congress and could become the law of the land. But Mr. Crocker and other pioneers of the concept are doubtful about its chances of success. They aren't abandoning efforts to curb emissions. But they are tiptoeing away from an idea they devised decades ago, doubting it can work on the grand scale now envisioned.\""I'm skeptical that cap-and-trade is the most effective way to go about regulating carbon,"" says Mr. Crocker, 73 years old, a retired economist in Centennial, Wyo. He says he prefers an outright tax on emissions because it would be easier to enforce and provide needed flexibility to deal with the problem.\The House has passed cap-and-trade legislation. The Senate could take up a measure in September. But Republicans strongly oppose the idea -- arguing that it is a tax that will hurt the economy -- and Democrats are struggling to come up with an approach that apportions the inevitable cost of a cap-and-trade system among different interests, from consumers to utilities to coal plants.\Mr. Crocker, who went on to become a professor at the University of Wyoming, is one of two economists who dreamed up cap-and-trade in the 1960s. The other, John Dales, who died in 2007, was also a skeptic of using the idea to tame global warning.\""It isn't a cure-all for everything,"" Mr. Dales said in an interview in 2001. ""There are lots of situations that don't apply.""\Mr. Crocker sees two modern-day problems in using a cap-and-trade system to address the global greenhouse-gas issue. The first is that carbon emissions are a global problem with myriad sources. Cap-and-trade, he says, is better suited for discrete, local pollution problems. ""It is not clear to me how you would enforce a permit system internationally,"" he says. ""There are no institutions right now that have that power.""\Europe has embraced cap-and-trade rules. Emissions initially rose there because industries were given more permits than they needed, and regulators have since tightened the caps. Meanwhile China, India and other developing markets are reluctant to go along, fearing limits would curb their growth. If they don't participate, there is little assurance that global carbon emissions will slow much even if the U.S. goes forward with its own plan. And even if everyone signs up, Mr. Crocker says, it isn't clear the limits will be properly enforced across nations and industries.\The other problem, Mr. Crocker says, is that quantifying the economic damage of climate change -- from floods to failing crops -- is fraught with uncertainty. One estimate puts it at anywhere between 5% and 20% of global gross domestic product. Without knowing how costly climate change is, nobody knows how tight a grip to put on emissions.\In this case, he says Washington needs to come up with an approach that will be flexible and easy to adjust over a long stretch of time as more becomes known about damages from greenhouse-gas emissions. Mr. Crocker says cap-and-trade is better suited for problems where the damages are clear -- like acid rain in the 1990s -- and a hard limit is needed quickly.\""Once a cap is in place,"" he warns, ""it is very difficult to adjust."" For example, buyers of emissions permits would see their value reduced if the government decided in the future to loosen the caps.\Joseph Aldy, a White House adviser on the environment, calls the argument a ""straw man,"" saying a market-based cap is being designed with built-in flexibility. For example, a price ceiling on carbon allowances could prevent the program from becoming too big a burden on households and businesses and a floor would prevent a big loss in the value of permits. And unlike a tax, he says, a cap ensures carbon reduction.\Pollution has been a puzzle for economists for decades. In the early 1900s, a British economist named Arthur Pigou proposed taxes on polluters. Ronald Coase, a University of Chicago economist, won a Nobel Prize for his 1960 book, ""The Problem of Social Cost,"" which showed how market economics could address pollution problems.\In 1966, Mr. Crocker, still struggling to finish his thesis at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, sketched out the cap-and-trade idea to deal with air pollution produced by fertilizer plants in Florida. Mr. Crocker first pitched the idea of trading at a conference in Washington. He had been asked to attend as a stand-in for a professor who couldn't go and present data on the Florida plants. He didn't have all the data yet and came up with the theory instead.\Working separately, Mr. Dales in 1968 published a book called, ""Pollution, Property and Prices,"" which used the same approach for farmers who were polluting Canadian lakes and streams.\Their logic went like this: When governments capped smog emissions from power plants or the runoff of pesticides by farmers into local streams, it was indirectly putting a value on these emissions. Some farmers and some power plants could reduce these emissions more efficiently than others, and some placed a higher value on them than others. By setting caps on pollution but then allowing the polluters to trade these rights, the economists theorized, the polluters themselves would figure out the cheapest way to meet new targets.\Another economist, David Montgomery, advanced their ideas in the 1970s, converting their theories into the complex mathematical formulas to demonstrate that they weren't merely an idea but were also economically feasible. Mr. Montgomery, too, is a skeptic of cap-and-trade for greenhouse gases. He prefers an outright tax.\""You get huge swings in carbon prices with a cap, which creates more volatility and uncertainty for business,"" he says.\Cap-and-trade got a big boost in 1990, when President George H.W. Bush signed amendments to the Clean Air Act that imposed new limits on emissions of sulfur dioxide, which produces acid rain. Economists said the move let producers save billions of dollars and still hit their targets.\Still, Messrs. Dales and Crocker never got much personal mileage out of the idea. Mr. Crocker says he had such a hard time getting funding to further his research on the subject that he moved on to other matters. So far, he has stayed on the sidelines in the debate about cap-and-trade.\Credit: By Jon Hilsenrath"
29,"When I was California Assembly Speaker in 2006, I proudly negotiated with Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to lay down a marker in the fight against climate change by placing strict reductions on greenhouse gas emissions through Assembly Bill 32.\We knew we had to do something, especially after the U.S. pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol.\AB 32 gave the California Air Resources Board the ability to create a system in which polluters had to pay if they were unable to directly reduce their emissions. This first-ever cap-and-trade system has become instrumental to California's economy.\Payments by polluters generate much-needed funds to clean up our environment and make California the leader in renewable energy that it is today.\California has made great strides with investments from our cap-and-trade revenue, including massive efforts to get more electric vehicles on our roads and improving the environment of our poorest communities, all while reducing our greenhouse gas emissions at a historic rate.\Unfortunately, some of this important progress may be threatened by diversions of cap-and-trade funds for investments that are barely related to the original intent of AB 32.\The last thing our state and the planet can afford is for cap-and-trade funds to be turned into a slush fund for pet projects that do little or nothing to improve our environment.\Over the years, we have seen standards weakened on the original cap-and-trade deal as it relates to what qualifies for appropriate spending of these dollars and there are now efforts underway to even further destabilize this critically important funding source, and it is causing great alarm for those of us who fought so hard for this program.\By allowing these funds to be used on unrelated projects we will never meet our greenhouse gas reduction goals or truly address the devastating impacts of climate change.\Clean drinking water, high-speed rail, and workforce training are critical to California's future. But it is more appropriate to invest in these areas from the state's general fund and not from the cap-and-trade revenue.\I urge the Legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom to not allow diversions to continue, and to be the environmental stewards they have been throughout their political careers.\California has led the fight on climate change. We are now seeing much of the rest of the country follow. All of the top Democratic presidential candidates are making the fight against climate change a cornerstone of their campaigns.\Our cap-and-trade system is our strongest tool in fixing this existential threat. We must not let it rust away in the toolbox. It is imperative that we not cheapen the world-class program we all worked so hard to create over a decade ago.\Fabian Núñez is former California Assembly Speaker and co-author of AB 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act, fnunez@mercuryllc.com.

30,"The entirely theoretical argument presented by Richard Sexton and Steve Sexton (""The Fatal Flaw in California's Cap-and-Trade Program
,"" Cross Country, Oct. 21) falls short in just one place: the real world. The facts show that under California's law to limit climate pollution, our economy is thriving, jobs are being added at a faster rate than the national average and emissions are decreasing ahead of schedule.\The authors complain about a potential problem with some cap-and-trade systems: the risk of emissions and economic leakage, while also decrying one of the solutions, allocating free allowances to trade-exposed industries in proportion to their output. This ensures that producers aren't penalized for making more goods, and producers who make more goods with fewer emissions are rewarded. Total emissions are still limited by the cap.\There's a good reason that the authors limit their case to hypotheticals. Five years into cap and trade, there is no actual evidence that leakage is a concern. In contrast, there's plenty of evidence that the cap-and-trade program is doing exactly what it's intended to do: help the state cut carbon pollution and continue to lead the world on climate action.\Quentin Foster\Environmental Defense Fund\Sacramento, Calif.\The real flaw is the goal in the first place, never mind the solution. California's real impact on the environment will never come from being a carbon-neutral state. It comes from its example to the world of high environmental standards while still being one of the world's largest economies. But one has to wonder how much longer other states and countries will look to California's leadership when they see the sky-high cost of living and middle-class jobs leaving the state. The governor should focus on that first, and the rest of his goals will follow.\Tom Mysz\Oakland, Calif.\The authors believe that California's cap-and-trade program is flawed because it does nothing to reduce pollution. But it created another state agency, which means more government and higher taxes. It also hurts business. Mission accomplished.\James Elliott\Doral, Fla."
31,"""We feel like we're the guys in the Alamo and the reinforcements actually did arrive.""\Rep. Carl Wilson, R-Grants Pass, said of the conservative,\mostly rural Oregonians arriving in Salem for the rally\In the early morning hours Thursday, hundreds of truckers from across Oregon formed a multi-city convoy and joined hundreds more outside the Capitol building to rally against a controversial carbon emissions cap-and-trade bill.\At least 2,000 people filled the Capitol steps and mall.\Truckers came from as far away as La Grande and Coos Bay and Medford — some beginning their treks just after midnight.\If passed, Senate Bill 1530 would impose a sweeping, economy-wide cap on carbon emissions and charge the state's largest polluters for emissions over the cap.\Democrats control the Oregon House, Senate and Governor's Office, leaving many Republicans feeling under siege. Republican lawmakers attending the rally expressed support and gratefulness for the protesters.\""We feel like we're the guys in the Alamo and the reinforcements actually did arrive,"" Rep. Carl Wilson, R-Grants Pass, said of the conservative, mostly rural Oregonians arriving in Salem for the rally.\In the summer of 2019, a walkout by Senate Republicans and a protest by the group Timber Unity — the group also behind Thursday's rally — proceeded the death of last year's carbon cap-and-trade bill.\Those protesting Thursday said the 2020 bill would destroy their communities, livelihoods and careers. They urged lawmakers to put the issue before the voters instead of pushing it through the Legislature.\The Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources started taking public testimony on the bill at 3 p.m. The hearing room was packed with onlookers and overflow areas started getting crowded as well.\More than twice as many people signed up to testify against the bill as those who signed up in support.\During the rally, Jeff Leavy, one of the founders of Timber Unity, ripped up a copy of the proposed bill in front of the crowd. ""We are under fire, and they are coming for us,"" he said.\Another speaker led the crowd in a chant, demanding: ""Let us vote!""\Semi-trucks, tractors, logging trucks and farming equipment snaked around the Capitol building, slowing nearby traffic to a crawl. The hum of the engines and blasts from their horns punctuated the sound of country music and C.W. McCall's ""Convoy.""\Earlier in the day, the influx of trucks on Interstate 5 and routes leading to the Capitol and meet-up spots at the Oregon State Fairgrounds caused delays during rush hour.\A volunteer manning a registration booth estimated about 2,500 were in attendance by 10 a.m. Buses carrying participants who parked their trucks at nearby fairgrounds continued to stream in well into the morning.\Timber Unity officials estimated about 1,100 trucks joined the convoy and rally.\The rally had only been going for a few hours when tensions spilled over during a 9:30 a.m. meeting of the Senate Housing and Development Committee.\Sen. Dallas Heard, R-Roseburg, was preparing to testify on a bill he is sponsoring.\Committee chair Sen. Shemia Fagan, D-Portland, began the hearing by saying that the ""chaos"" at the Capitol — referring to the trucks and noise outside — prevented the committee from starting on time so witnesses would need to limit their testimony to three minutes.\Speaking to two women who'd come to testify, Fagan said, ""It's frustrating when people try to shut down the Capitol. It makes it where folks like you, that came to be heard, don't get to be heard all the time. So, on behalf of Oregon State Capitol, (I) apologize for the chaos this morning. So, with that, Senator Heard.""\""All right then,"" said committee member Sen. Denyc Boles, R-Salem, as she stormed out of the committee.\""Wow,"" Heard said. Right then, a particularly deep truck horn blared and Heard leaned back in his chair, allowing the sound to fill the room.\""Your three minutes are going; would you like to testify?"" Fagan asked.\Heard shook his head. ""Nope."" He collected his things and stood.\""There's no respect in this building. That does not apply to you or you,"" he said, pointing to the other remaining committee members, Sen. Rob Wagner, D-Lake Oswego, and Sen. Jeff Golden, D-Ashland.\""I guess there are no proponents for the bill,"" Fagan said, proceeding to call up a panel of opponents.\Heard crossed the room to get the rest of his paperwork. ""I don't believe the First Amendment only applies to one party,"" he said.\""You are the government, Sen. Heard,"" Fagan replied as Heard left.\The bill, Senate Bill 1555, would ""authorize development of certain parsonages on lots or parcels with places of worship either existing or being developed.""\At the end of the short hearing, Fagan said it would be hard to consider moving the bill forward because no one had testified in support.\A convoy of trucks surrounded the Capitol building. Some sported the American flag, the State of Oregon flag or Trump 2020 banners.\A crowd of several hundred rallied on the steps of the building. Families pushed strollers, people walked dogs and volunteers in neon vests registered voters. Their conversations were frequently drowned out by the honking of horns.\Dozens of families joined the rally. Evelyn Wakimoto, of Beaverton, manned a booth passing out veggie straws, organic popcorn and applesauce.\""I'm here to show my daughter how important it is to stand up for your human rights,"" she said, pulling in her 4-year-old daughter for a hug.\She chatted with other parents, kids in tow, about how the proposed bill would make the price of everything from groceries to toilet paper go up.\The issue is personal for her. Her dad contracts with the postal service to deliver mail. Her great-grandfather was a trucker.\""It's in our blood,"" Wakimoto said.\She said the bill would cause her father's company to shut down. An issue with such a monumental impact should go to the voters, she said.\Those trekking in from Lebanon said they woke up at 4 a.m. to join the convoy.\Phyllis Kerby, of Dallas, said she was lucky enough to have the morning off. She stood talking in the cold at dawn with Keith Kennedy, of Lebanon. Both were concerned with how the bill would affect their ability to work.\""I wouldn't be able to do what I love anymore,"" Kerby said.\Some who didn't have the day off were given paid time off to attend the rally.\""They're big supporters of this,"" said Arlyn Dunn, of Lyons, of his employer, Freres Lumber Co.\He and his fellow drivers talked about the impact the proposed cap-and-trade legislation would have on their livelihoods.\The rising fuel costs and stricter equipment standards will take their toll on mom-and-pop businesses, families and working Oregonians, said John Lotze, of Stayton. They want the issue taken to voters.\""It would get voted right out the door,"" he said.\A similar truck protest organized last year by Timber Unity caused lengthy delays in the city and on area highways as loggers, truckers and farmers congregated in Salem to speak out against statewide caps on carbon emissions.\Angelita Sanchez, a Sweet Home trucking company owner and secretary of Timber Unity's board of directors, said this year's rally is more organized than last year's.\The 2019 protest also occurred during the busy season and was quickly organized.\In contrast, Timber Unity has been planning this rally for months, and it comes during a slow time for many farmers, loggers and construction workers.\""I really hope legislators are inspired by the sheer volume of people from across Oregon who are going to show up tomorrow to share their concerns about the cap-and-trade tax,"" said Todd Stoffel, Vice President, Timber Unity Association. ""They're coming off their farms, out of the forests, and driving from hundreds of miles away to put a face to the impact that lawmakers will have if they don't listen to those of us affected by the policy agendas of special interests.""\Maybe lawmakers will be inspired to set aside their concerns about their own reelection and ""do what's right for the people of Oregon,"" Stoffel added.\Timber Unity officials said they are against the cap-and-trade bill and what members see as abuse of the short legislative session by Democrats.\Those involved instead want to take the issue to voters.\A litany of lawmakers, including Rep. Bill Post, R-Keizer, Sen. Herman E. Baertschiger Jr., R-Grants Pass, and Sen. Kim Thatcher, R-Keizer, spoke at the rally.\During her speech, Thatcher announced she will run for Oregon Secretary of State, making her the first Republican in the race.\Timber Unity leaders presented several lawmakers with ""Courage and Conviction"" awards for speaking out against the cap-and-trade bill.\This year the legislation, SB1530, has been amended to, among other things, phase in carbon fees on transportation fuel on a geographic basis, starting in the Portland area. More amendments are expected.\But some Republicans still object and want the issue referred to voters. They threatened another walkout if the bill went forward any other way.\Opposition doesn't just come from Republicans. After being given the ""Courage and Conviction"" award, Sen. Betsy Johnson, D-Scappoose, spoke out against both iterations of the cap-and-trade bill.\""This was a bad bill last session,"" the Democrat said to a round of applause and cheers. ""It's a bad bill this session.""\Timber Unity leaders also met with Gov. Kate Brown Thursday morning during the rally.\That same day, Renew Oregon, an environment advocacy coalition, held a news conference in Portland featuring youth from across the state who declared a climate emergency.\Spokesman Brad Reed said the group's rural supporters in the timber and farming industries plan to speak at Thursday's public hearing on the bill.\A pro-climate action rally is also scheduled for Tuesday, Feb. 11. at the Capitol. Reed said turnout is expected to surpass the 800 people who attended their rally last year.\Meanwhile, the Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources will take additional public testimony on SB1530 from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday.\All of the hearings will be held in Hearing Room C at the Capitol. Those wishing to testify can sign up beginning an hour before the start of each meeting. Testimony will be limited to two minutes per person.

This fall, Congress faces a major economic and environmental decision that will affect the lives of all Americans: what to do about climate change. While some Americans question whether global warming is threatening our future, many federal legislators agree it must be addressed. How to do that is the multibillion-dollar question.
\
Congress' answer is to create a cap-and-trade market. Under this approach, the government caps the amount of carbon dioxide companies can emit. The government then auctions or gives away ""emission allowances"" -- each allowance being the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide. Experts estimate these auctions could amount to more than $100 billion annually. Companies could then trade allowances on a ""carbon market"" open to everyone, including Wall Street players.
\
As a not-for-profit public power utility, we have a huge stake in this debate. Since our mandate is to provide reliable, reasonably priced electric service, while protecting the environment, the cost of climate change legislation is immensely important to us. Unlike investor-owned utilities, we can't absorb new cap-and-trade costs by trimming profit margins or reducing shareholder dividends. Especially in tough economic times, customers don't want us passing on additional costs or sacrificing service.
\
This month, the U.S. Senate debates the American Clean Energy and Security Act (HR2454), a cap-and-trade bill that passed the U.S. House in June. The bill has shortcomings that could result in costs harmful to consumers, the economy and the reliability of our electric system, without providing any environmental benefit.
\
If Congress addresses climate change with a new multibillion-dollar market, they need to get it right.
\
The most important thing the Senate can do is place a ceiling on carbon allowance prices to ensure a cap-and-trade market does not result in runaway prices. Some want a ceiling and a floor to keep prices high enough to motivate changes in behavior without harming our economy. Since HR2454 also contains mandatory reduction targets, emission reductions will occur. But prices must be capped to avoid volatility and limit risk to electricity customers.
\
Any cap-and-trade legislation should also allocate (not auction) emission allowances at no cost to public power and other local distribution utilities so they can pass their value directly to customers. Whether allowances are auctioned or allocated, the emissions cap means greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced. Competitive auctioning allowances would just increase prices.
\
To ensure unregulated generators do not receive windfall profits at the expense of consumers, allowances should be given only to local distribution utilities that directly serve retail customers. These entities are regulated by state and local governments that will require the value of allowances be passed on to customers. Unregulated ""merchant"" generators face no such restrictions and will likely pass that value on to their shareholders. The House climate change bill would allocate up to 10 percent of emission allowances for the electricity industry to merchant generators.
\
If lawmakers want to reduce greenhouse gas, community-owned power groups are asking our leaders to pass laws that are both fair and affordable. Current legislation falls woefully short of this goal. We urge citizens join us in asking Sen. Orrin Hatch (202-224-5251) and Sen. Bob Bennett (202-224-5444) for a law that balances the needs of consumers, our economy and our environment.

Climate change, including its root causes and possible solutions, is an issue that is being hotly debated right now at universities, in the media and in the Legislature.
\
To date, the Springfield Utility Board intentionally has stepped away from the debate. As a consumer-owned utility, we respect our customers' diversity of opinions on the matter.
\
Instead, we are focused on making informed policy decisions that provide our customers with cost-effective energy and water solutions now and in the future. This includes being mindful of the impact to the environment, a goal that has been unchanged for decades.
\
But the rapidly changing regulatory environment has highlighted the need to focus on the next generation of energy sources. While looking to the future, we can learn from the past.
\
Springfield Utility Board and other consumer-owned utilities have a long history of investing in renewable energy. As customers of the Bonneville Power Administration and with BPA's power being from predominantly hydroelectric generation, consumer-owned utilities have resources that are more than 92 percent greenhouse-gas free. Compared to the nation, which on average has a power portfolio that is only 26 percent greenhouse-gas free, local utilities have led by example.
\
SUB has been a customer of BPA for more than 50 years. We have invested in energy and water conservation measures in the effort to reduce customers' bills while helping minimize the impact on the environment.
\
Turning to the regulatory environment, it is extremely dynamic right now - unusually so compared to the past. SUB and other utilities are constantly reviewing regulatory proposals at the state and federal level. It is not unusual for them to conflict.
\
SUB's participation in the process is intended to ground theoretical ideas to practical solutions. While our underlying goals remain unchanged, how we respond to particular regulatory proposals depends on how they mesh with other proposals.
\
Sometimes they fit. Often times they don't.
\
We also don't want to have unintended consequences. For example - let's look at carbon cap and trade.
\
Carbon cap and trade is a mechanism where carbon credits (or fossil fuel emissions credits) could be traded. On day one, utilities would be given a limited, fixed allocation of credits that they could use to apply to new or existing generation or, if they have excess credits, sell credits to other entities.
\
Sounds workable. However, an unbounded trading structure could result in speculators buying large amounts of these finite credits. By cornering the market, speculators could set the price - driving up the cost of credits and the cost of generation, and creating an artificial economic stranglehold.
\
Does SUB support the environment? Absolutely. Would we support a structure that would allow speculators to hold us hostage in the name of the environment? SUB believes that making the environment into a commodity would ultimately backfire, turning something precious into pork bellies. The environment shouldn't be associated with Enron (which manipulated the power markets in the recent past).
\
SUB continues to strive for thoughtful solutions.
\
Through cooperation with other utilities, we supported Oregon's Renewable Portfolio Standard, which requires utilities meet certain benchmarks for their renewable energy supplies. We're engaged in the Western Climate Initiative, which could establish carbon cap and trade for Western states. We currently have utility policies that exceed state requirements related to promotion of renewables. Commercial, industrial and residential conservation remains strong.
\
We look forward to working with our customers and other utilities to build on our successes, and SUB greatly appreciates the strong support of our customers in protecting the environment.

34,"In what are likely to be blueprints for a national effort to fight climate change, clusters of states on the East and West Coasts and in the Midwest are setting up marketplaces for electric utilities and other companies to buy and sell credits to emit carbon dioxide and other gases responsible for global warming.\Building on a voluntary market system pioneered in Chicago, 10 Northeastern states recently launched what they are billing as the biggest, most coordinated effort yet in the U.S. to take on climate change by mandating that electric utilities take part in an emissions-allowance trading program.\But an alliance of seven Western states and four Canadian provinces could surpass their efforts with a more ambitious trading system they unveiled last month. It encompasses industry as well as utilities, with a goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent in 12 years.\And a consortium of six Midwestern states, including Illinois and Wisconsin, and one Canadian province are establishing their own carbon-trading market, aiming to have it running in 2010.\These programs embrace the ""cap-and-trade"" approach that has the support of both the Democratic and GOP presidential nominees. Proponents say it offers an effective way to cut the emissions blamed for warming the climate, and to do so cheaply and more efficiently than a regulatory program.\The results for consumers are unclear. Although cutting carbon dioxide emissions is predicted to raise electric rates, cap-and-trade may mean the cost will be less than conventional regulations, and in many states some of the proceeds from the sales of emissions allowances will be spent on promoting energy efficiency and conservation, saving households money on their electric bills.\Whatever the eventual impact on household budgets, the first auction of emissions allowances at the New York Mercantile Exchange last month represented the opening of a new chapter in America's response to the threat of climate change caused by the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere.\""The start of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative auction of emission allowances demonstrates both how far we've come and how far we need to go to effectively address climate change,"" said Eileen Claussen, head of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, referring to the effort by the Northeastern states. ""These states are paving the path to a comprehensive national program that offers the most cost-effective solution to significantly reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.""\Emissions trading started in the 1990s with efforts to reduce sulfur dioxide, the cause of acid rain. When that proved successful at cutting emissions quickly for much less than the cost of a conventional regulatory program, the cap-and-trade approach came to be seen as a way to tackle the bigger problem of global warming.\Chicago's Richard Sandor, credited with creating a host of financial futures markets at the Chicago Board of Trade, established the first full-fledged carbon market, the Chicago Climate Exchange, in 2003. A voluntary trading system, the exchange has a membership of 300 companies and organizations.\""We continue to be very positive on the growth of worldwide emissions markets, despite the current economic situation,"" said Sandor, who also oversees a Chicago-based futures market for carbon credits and a European climate exchange.\Indeed, with presidential candidates Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) favoring a cap-and-trade system, it's likely that a national trading program will be set up, after years of little action on the federal level, to combat global warming.\""There are differences between the two candidates on climate,"" said Harvard University's Robert Stavins, a specialist in environmental economics. ""However, what's most striking is that if the difference between the two candidates is 1 foot, then both of them have a distance of about 1 mile from the current administration.""\The cap-and-trade approach can have pitfalls. When European countries set up carbon trading in 2005, they not only issued the credits for free, they gave away too many. That led to huge profits for some companies.\The Northeastern states have been criticized for setting too generous a cap -- 188 million tons annually -- for the first several years of their program. Emissions have fallen below that level in recent years because of rising fuel prices and a slowing economy.\But Jonathan Schrag, executive director of the regional initiative, noted that during the first auction, the allowances fetched $3.07 each, well above the $1.86 floor price the states had set. And although only 12.6 million allowances were sold -- covering an equal number of tons of carbon dioxide emissions -- the states received bids for four times that many allowances, a sign that utilities recognize the value of the trading process.\""I think we have set the bar very high for a model that could easily be adapted for a national program,"" said Pete Grannis, commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.\But Harvard's Stavins noted that the Northeastern states require only power plants to take part in the cap-and-trade program. The Western Climate Initiative, which includes California, will take in a much broader array of sources, including industry and transportation.\Although still in the planning stage, the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord, of which Illinois is a member, will include a variety of sources, said accord chief Jesse Heier.\""It makes more sense, we thought, to look at the whole range of sources,"" Heier said. ""We didn't think it was right to pick just one and go after it. Emissions really know no borders.""\- - -\How a cap-and-trade system works\The concept is that some power plants and businesses can reduce emissions more easily than others for a host of reasons, such as having newer facilities, different fuel supplies or more flexible generating or manufacturing processes.\By issuing a set number of credits, states give those utilities and manufacturers an incentive to reduce their emissions quickly so they will have leftover allowances to sell to companies that cannot adjust as cheaply or quickly.\But because the overall number of credits gradually declines, total emissions fall.\The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative has set a limit of 188 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year for the 233 power plants in the 10 Northeastern states it covers. The group has begun auctioning emission allowances totaling 188 million tons.\Utilities must have allowances to cover their emissions, either by buying them through the auction, buying them from someone else (such as another utility or a broker) or by reducing their emissions. And they can sell any allowances they don't need, giving them an incentive to reduce their emissions.\The ""cap"" will remain at 188million tons through 2014. After that it will decline by 2.5 percent a year, yielding a 10 percent reduction by 2018. The money that the group raises through the auction of allowances will be distributed to the member states, many of which are using it to promote energy efficiency, conservation and alternative energy sources.\----------\soswanson@tribune.com\Get more on the environment\To learn about living green and efforts being made by other cities, go to chicagotribune.com/green\Credit: By Stevenson Swanson, Tribune correspondent"
35,"Cap-and-trade could be the best tool to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to help conquer global climate change. It also could promote industrial innovation and help clean up the environment in Lee County and nationwide.\Here in Lee County, county commissioners are looking to breathe new life into Lee County's business community by encouraging cap-and-trade programs that will promote new green businesses and ideas.\Lee County businesses already are working on alternative energy (solar) and fuels (cooking oil and jatropha for county vehicles), and a few consultants are looking to greener transportation issues and solutions, such as the one-way tolling system in Cape Coral, which helps to reduce car emissions.\But we can do more. Cap-and-trade could be one of the solutions to turn around Lee County's economy.\Here's how it works: a cap-and-trade system sets a ""cap"" -- or limit -- on industry emissions and distributes ""rights"" to emit greenhouse gases, called allowances.\Industries are regulated up to the level of the cap. If a company reduces its emissions below its cap, it can receive pollution credits it can sell, ""trade,"" or transfer to other firms that are unable to meet the cap requirements.\Companies do not have individual caps, and must ensure that they acquire a sufficient quantity of allowances to cover their emissions in any given compliance period. Allowances and reductions are kept under the cap. The cap is condensed over time, further reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions and helping the environment. The goal is to slow global warming.\Cap-and-trade has recently emerged as a tool for addressing greenhouse gas emissions, but it also has a successful financial and environmental history.\In the early 1990s, high levels of sulphur dioxide emissions resulted in acid rain in the Eastern United States. Title IV of the Clean Air Act established a cap-and-trade program in 1995 to reduce these emissions. The program was successful in achieving the targeted emission level and achieved reductions at a cost that was far lower than projected. These emission reductions were obtained despite the dramatic growth in electricity demand.\President Barack Obama is calling for an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gasses, and Congress is moving fast with cap-and-trade legislation with the same ambitious goals. Environmentally, significant long-term reductions in greenhouse gas emissions must take place. Technological breakthroughs to meet this challenge will need to come from many areas --renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy storage technology, new fuels, and more. Because a cap-and-trade system is not technology specific, it can encourage and accommodate any emerging technologies.\This provides business opportunities both for Lee County's small business start-ups and large firms.\Some politicians, industry leaders and utility naysayers claim that every tax dollar applied to a ton of carbon dioxide would mean a 1 percent increase in energy rates, which is why some industry titans are fighting the changes. The same anti-cap-and-trade groups also say that those costs would be passed down to customers.\However, federal assistance money will offset these costs by moving innovative projects forward and helping to offset initial cost increases. It also will provide needed jobs right away while providing for the future environmental integrity of the planet. Cap-and-trade has proven in the past that it works for the environment and the economy. Let's get fired up about this and see it as an opportunity. And I'd like to see innovative ideas from local businesses (such as the recently approved endeavor to turn jatropha plant oil into fuel for county vehicles) come before county commissioners. Lee County needs the business and the work.\-- Lee County Commissioner Bob Janes represents District 1."
36,"Brace yourselves. President Barack Obama is expected to announce today new EPA rules to reduce carbon emissions from the nation's power plants by 20 percent and to force more polluters to participate in cap-and-trade programs. The inflammatory rhetoric from the opposition is likely to reach a Category 5 Event: Massive bloviation.\Conservatives, particularly that subset of flat-earthers who are skeptical of anything that smacks of ""science,"" are expected to pounce, first, because it involves addressing climate change; second, may be viewed as anti-coal; and third, involves executive authority, which they detest -- at least when it's wielded by a Democrat. They will rail against the regulations as costly, unnecessary and job-killing when, in fact, they are none of the above. \If anything, the prospect of reducing carbon emissions from existing power plants by 20 percent is almost criminally overdue. And the impact on electricity costs, coal production and the economy is likely to be modest -- if anything, it will produce more jobs in aggregate as new investments are made in greener energy, conservation and new markets for buying and selling government-issued pollution permits. \How can we predict this? Easy. Maryland has already started down this road as part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a nine-state coalition that has set limits on carbon-dioxide emissions in this state as well as New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Rhode Island. Emission ""allowances"" are sold at auction and the proceeds are used to promote renewable energy and supplement energy costs in low-income households. \It has not pushed electricity prices significantly higher. It has not hurt the state's economy. It has not killed jobs. And while it's true that the domestic coal industry has suffered in recent years, it's obvious that the chief culprit has been the rise of cheap and readily available natural gas. Americans are destined to get more of their electricity from gas-fueled power plants thanks more to the development of drilling technology than government regulation. \Maryland demonstrated considerable foresight in jumping on a market-based program like cap-and-trade early, and now other states will need to follow that example. And it should not be a partisan effort either, as RGGI was endorsed by Northeastern governors of both political parties when it was first developed nearly a decade ago (including at one point by a certain former investment banker and Massachusetts governor named Mitt Romney). The failure of an energy bill that contained a national cap-and-trade program in the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate in 2010 was one of the most regrettable losses of the first Obama term. \Yet this is a classic win-win situation. Cap-and-trade has an effect similar to a tax on carbon, allowing the marketplace to correct a worsening problem -- the failure to appropriately factor in the true cost of burning coal and other fossil fuels on human health and the environment. It's time to stop subsidizing the coal industry with our children's future. \Coal-fired power plants are this country's single greatest source of greenhouse gases and thus a major culprit in climate change. And it's also abundantly clear that a divided, sharply partisan Congress is fundamentally incapable of addressing this problem. That leaves only the Environmental Protection Agency and the White House to protect our future. \Make no mistake, this is not anti-business. A lot of folks in the utility industry will be pleased to see the regulations move forward, chiefly because it will finally bring some consistency to the market and create new opportunities for renewable power. Meanwhile, burning less coal will also mean reducing harmful and potentially cancer-causing byproducts like mercury and sulfuric acid that are a threat to human health and the environment as well. \Opponents can make all kinds of misleading claims about cap-and-trade, but they can't call it unproven. It's worked in the Northeast -- reducing power plant pollution by as much as 40 percent, providing $1.6 billion in new revenue for energy-related government investments and producing a negligible impact on consumers' monthly bills. The next step is to get the rest of the county on board, and then perhaps the U.S. can convince the world (at least those countries that haven't already taken similar steps) to follow.\Credit: THE BALTIMORE SUN"
37," WASHINGTON -- California Sen. Dianne Feinstein positioned herself as a key centrist on global warming Wednesday, proposing the first national cap-and-trade program to win broad backing from the electric utility industry.\ Flanked by top executives from companies including Pacific Gas & Electric and Calpine, Feinstein and co-author Sen. Tom Carper, D- Del., described the plan as having the best shot of becoming law among the many greenhouse gas bills sprouting on Capitol Hill.\ ""This is the most aggressive global warming bill that this industry has supported to date,"" said Feinstein, a Democrat. Pointing to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's bid to create a cap-and- trade system, she said, ""I believe this equals what California is trying to do.""\ The bill would reduce power plant emissions 25 percent below anticipated levels by 2020.\ Emissions would be capped at 2006 levels in 2011, and over the next decade would be reduced to 2001 levels. Emissions would be decreased 1 percent each year after that until 2020.\ At the same time, the Environmental Protection Agency would publicly auction credits. Most of that revenue would go toward helping companies purchase clean technology.\ Feinstein projected that the auction would raise at least $9 billion by 2036, and possibly as much as $55 billion.\ ""(Global warming is) happening. But if we act now, with purpose, the most serious consequences can be averted,"" Feinstein said.\ PG&E Corp. chief executive officer Peter Darby called Feinstein's bill ""pragmatic and aggressive, a serious response to a serious problem.""\ In total, the companies -- which also included Entergy, Florida Power and Light, Exelon and the Public Service Enterprise Group -- operate in 42 states and supply more than 15 percent of electricity consumed in the U.S.\ The bill does not address coal-fired plants. Lawmakers on Wednesday suggested attacking coal will likely meet with fierce political resistance.\ ""There's coal in 40 states. That makes the garnering of votes here in the Senate very difficult,"" Feinstein acknowledged.\ While she reached out to a number of companies for feedback while crafting the bill, Feinstein said Southern California Edison notably declined to work with her office.\ ""I assume it's because they have coal. I was very disappointed,"" she said.\ A spokeswoman for Southern California Edison declined to discuss Feinstein's bill specifically and said the company is evaluating several global warming-related bills.\ Meanwhile, the bill produced a lukewarm response from environmentalists.\ ""We are looking forward to working with her further in hopes of bringing the proposal closer to what we see as the necessary steps,"" said Natural Resources Defense Council spokeswoman Julia Bovey.\ ""We don't want the best bill that can pass. We want the best bill,"" Bovey said, noting a sweeping measure by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and California Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat, is considered the gold standard in global warming law.\ Feinstein's bill is expected to be one of many released in the coming weeks to address global warming.\ Boxer, who chairs the Senate Environment Committee, will consider all the greenhouse gas-related proposals, her spokeswoman said.\ lisa.friedman(at)langnews.com\ (202) 662-8731"
38,"WASHINGTON - Key lawmakers agreed yesterday on a strategy for replacing gas-guzzling cars with more fuel-efficient models, but much tougher negotiations lie ahead on a bill that would, for the first time, limit emissions linked to global warming.\President Obama summoned three dozen House Democrats to the White House to build consensus around climate and energy legislation that is under increasing criticism from Republicans and members of his own party.\The administration has endorsed the bill broadly, saying it would advance key parts of the president's domestic agenda, namely slowing global warming and transitioning to a clean energy economy.\But the details have largely been left to the House Energy committee, which is still working on the final language and has postponed a vote due to cost concerns raised by the panel's moderate Democrats and Democrats from coal- and oil-producing states that could struggle to meet the bill's mandates for pollution reductions and renewable electricity generation.\Committee members emerged from yesterday's meeting claiming a modest victory. They said they agreed to embrace a ""cash for clunkers"" plan that would provide $3,500 or $4,500 to people who replace old cars with new, more fuel-efficient models.\""Our committee is attempting to develop a consensus,"" panel chairman Henry Waxman of California said after the session, which all but two of the committee's 36 Democrats attended. ""Many of the issues split us along a regional basis. But we're talking to each other.""\Representative John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who pushed for the ""cash for clunkers"" provision, said its inclusion in the bill does not guarantee he will support the legislation in its entirety. Chief among the loose ends is a ""cap and trade"" proposal that would set a ceiling and put a price on greenhouse gas emissions. Companies could either purchase or receive their allowance for free, and then buy or sell portions of their allotment to meet emissions limits.\Obama's budget expects to raise $650 billion by auctioning off all the allowances to companies that release heat-trapping gases, with the bulk of the money going back to families to help with higher energy prices.\Democrats from coal and industrial states are pushing Waxman and his cosponsor, Representative Edward Markey of Massachusetts, to distribute at least some of those permits for free to ease costs.\As the Democrats met with Obama, House Republicans gathered at the Capitol for an energy summit to criticize the Waxman-Markey bill, which they said would create a national energy tax and hurt middle-class families and small businesses. Similar meetings are being planned this month in Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, and California before Republicans unveil their own plans to curb fossil fuel use and clean up the environment.\Representative Mike Pence of Indiana said yesterday that Republicans will look for commonsense solutions to lower energy costs, increase energy supply and create jobs. But he also acknowledged that part of their mission was to stop the ""profoundly bad idea"" of cap and trade.\Credit: Dina Cappiello, Associated Press"
39,"THE Washington power play to pass cap-and-trade legislation is deflating like a punctured balloon, but all the air is not out of it yet. \According to Reuters, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a climate legislation supporter, told environmental leaders in a private meeting last week that ""cap-and-trade is dead."" Graham has been working with John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., for months to get a cap-and-trade bill through the Senate.\The House of Representatives approved a climate bill last June.\But in recent months, climate fears have dissipated. Americans are much more worried about the economy - and less convinced that man's activities are causing a global meltdown.\A nationwide poll done by West Virginia's Mark Blankenship Enterprises for the National Federation of Independent Businesses found that 52 percent of Americans oppose cap-and-trade, while 37 percent support the legislation.\Americans worry that cap-and-trade will drive up their energy bills, cost jobs, and limit economic growth.\Those are additional burdens Americans want to avoid at a time when they continue to struggle with an uncertain economy and a slow recovery.\Now Kerry-Graham-Liberman have developed a fallback position to try to revive the process. The New York Times reports the trio will propose ""different types of limits for different sectors of the economy, beginning with electric utilities and then turning later to manufacturers such as chemical plants and pulp and paper mills.""\Meanwhile, the pressure is building on the Environmental Protection Agency to back away from its attempt to regulate greenhouse gas emissions by fiat. The EPA is in the process of designating carbon and other greenhouse gases as pollutants, then using the Clean Air Act to reduce the amount of carbon released into atmosphere.\Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Ark., is pushing a measure in the Senate aimed at stopping the EPA, and now there's a similar measure in the House of Representatives. Two top House Democrats, Collin Peterson, D-Minn., and Ike Skelton, D-Mo., are co-sponsoring a resolution along with Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., to trump the EPA's attempts to regulate carbon emissions.\Meanwhile, Sens. Jay Rockefeller and Robert Byrd of West Virginia have sent a letter to the EPA telling the agency not to proceed with greenhouse gas regulations. The letter, co-signed by a number of other energy state senators, says the EPA should leave it to the Congress to develop energy policy.\EPA has agreed to slow down its implementation of the Clean Air regulations on CO2 until at least 2011. Total regulation would not come until 2013.\That gives the Democrats some breathing room until they have a better opportunity to pass climate legislation.\So here's how the merry-go-round works:\The Obama administration and some members of Congress want cap-and-trade legislation to protect the environment and bring in billions of dollars in new revenue. When the bill starts to bog down, the EPA threatens to regulate carbon on its own.\Proponents of cap-and-trade think the EPA action is enough to convince wavering lawmakers that it's better for the Congress to pass cap-and-trade than live by the EPA's decision.\It was a pretty smart maneuver, the ultimate Washington power play.\And it could still work if lawmakers like Byrd and Rockefeller continue to see cap-and-trade as inevitable.\But the advocates have misjudged by not considering the full impact of Climategate revelations or the obvious reluctance of the American people to further damage the economy and raise their own taxes to achieve the improbable goal of lowering the earth's temperature by a fraction."
40,"Two important and interrelated events occurred recently that mean bad news for tens of thousands of Pennsylvania workers and families.\On Oct. 15, the federal government announced that Pennsylvania had lost another 10,300 jobs in September, pushing the state's unemployment rate to 8.8 percent. Our state has lost nearly 200,000 jobs since September 2008.\The last time Pennsylvania saw unemployment this high was 1984. And there doesn't seem to be a sign of relief on the horizon. Economists are predicting more job losses to come, with the national unemployment rate climbing over 10 percent.\Given these numbers, the last thing Washington politicians should do is introduce legislation that would cost thousands more jobs. But that is exactly what the U.S. Senate did two weeks ago.\With Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's blessing, California Sen. Barbara Boxer and Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry introduced a 923-page draft of legislation to set up a so-called cap-and-trade program. The program would impose an onerous indirect tax on the production and consumption of carbon-based energy. It would cap the amount of carbon dioxide businesses could emit, imposing a penalty when they exceed the cap, and would require that carbon emissions be cut by 20 percent of 2005 levels by 2020.\Independent studies have found that this would cost the country millions of jobs, but in an industrial state like Pennsylvania, the cap-and-trade tax would be even more harmful than elsewhere. Our state's coal, natural gas and manufacturing industries would be especially hard hit.\Pennsylvania is the fourth-largest coal-producing state in the country and coal plays a major part in the commonwealth's economy and electricity production. Coal accounts for more than half of all electricity produced in Pennsylvania. According to a National Association of Manufacturers' study, coal production would fall by about 85 percent and electricity production by about 21 percent as a result of a similar cap-and-trade bill passed in the House.\Pennsylvania is also home to the Marcellus Shale, one of the largest unconventional natural gas reserves in the world. It has the potential to turn our state into a major producer of clean energy and create thousands of jobs. But the new energy tax could doom this budding industry before it has a chance to develop.\The manufacturers' study finds the House cap-and trade bill would cost Pennsylvania more than 70,000 jobs in the years ahead. But that's not all. In just six years, it would increase gasoline prices by 6 percent to 8 percent, oil prices by 6 percent to 12 percent and natural gas prices by 14 percent to 21 percent.\Over time, this surge would accelerate. President Barack Obama admitted as much in a March interview, saying, ""Under my plan ... electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket."" The increased electricity and gas prices alone would be especially difficult on low-income Pennsylvania families who spend a larger portion of their income on energy.\As the cost of energy increases, Pennsylvania's energy-intensive manufacturing industry would slow significantly. The manufacturers' association predicts Pennsylvania manufacturing would experience decreases in output ranging between 4.9 percent and 5.5 percent, with high-energy industries suffering output losses as high as 9.2 percent. That can only mean one thing: lots more jobs lost in Pennsylvania.\The cap-and-trade proposal is so harmful to Pennsylvania it has garnered bipartisan opposition across the state. When a version of the bill passed the House of Representatives last June, one third of Pennsylvania Democratic congressmen joined all Pennsylvania Republicans in voting against it. In all, 44 House Democrats across the country opposed the bill in a truly bipartisan effort to stop this massive job-killer.\Sadly, that bipartisan group does not include Pennsylvania Rep. Joe Sestak, against whom I am running for the U.S. Senate, who voted for the bill and even expressed regret that it did not go far enough.\We can and must support commonsense policies that protect our environment, but that goal can be achieved without abandoning 70,000 or more Pennsylvania jobs and imposing higher gas and electricity prices on all Pennsylvanians. A focus on renewable energy, conservation, low-carbon energy like natural gas, nuclear energy and cleaner-coal technology are all part of the solution. But as unemployment climbs toward 10 percent, protecting our hard-working families must be our first priority."
41,"More than 400 people gathered at the Culture Center at the state Capitol on Saturday to protest cap-and-trade legislation being considered by the U.S. Senate. \Last month, the House passed legislation that would cut carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S., particularly those from coal-fired power plants.\Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., opened a town hall meeting at the Culture Center, which was followed by a rally on the Capitol steps at noon.\Capito expressed her concern about saving jobs for West Virginia coal miners, who make on average $63,000 a year.\Capito believes the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, passed by the House, could cost a household of four between $1,700 and $3,000 a year.\""A lot of people in West Virginia are living on fixed incomes. This also puts our nation at a competitive disadvantage across the world,"" she said.\At the recent G8 Summit meeting in Italy, Capito noted, ""Obama couldn't get China to sign on to reducing anything on emissions until 2050....\""Go off to the outer continental shelf and drill for our own resources,"" she said to strong applause from the audience.\""We need clean coal. We need more alternative energy - wind, solar, a good natural gas industry. And we need to use nuclear power.""\Don Nehlen, retired West Virginia University football coach, said, ""I am a friend of coal. I am not an expert on the environment. I am not an expert on global warming. But I am a friend of coal....\""This bill is bad for West Virginia. It is bad for the coal industry. And it is bad for America,"" Nehlen said.\Delegate Troy Andes, R-Putnam, a public relations official for Massey Energy, led the rally on the Capitol steps.\""I love the climate just the way it is,"" Andes said. ""Do you want to pay 90 percent more for electricity?""\People attending the rally carried signs stating: ""Cap & Trade Will Cost Jobs,"" ""Cap & Trade is Another Tax for West Virginia"" and ""Obama: Anti-Christ.""\Mike Stuart, who heads the West Virginia Conservative Foundation, urged people attending the rally to ""call Sen. Rockefeller and tell him to get off the fence.""\On Friday, Rockefeller said, ""I will absolutely fight for the future of coal and jobs in our state. I will not support an energy bill that threatens West Virginia's future.\""Technology can make coal even cleaner, but our nation cannot survive without energy from coal.\""People in the rest of the country need to know how dependent on West Virginia coal they are,"" Rockefeller said.\The Senate is working on its own energy bill, which could come up for consideration this fall.\The bill passed by the House is 1,500 pages long and contains 365 new federal regulations.\Reps. Nick J. Rahall and Alan Mollohan, both D-W.Va., also voted against cap-and-trade legislation.\Rahall said on June 26, ""It would be a mistake to sit back and allow other countries to devise international rules that will affect America's economic and energy interests....\""The international community has no interest in protecting American businesses.""\Rahall believes the U.S. should lead an international effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but must ""strike a balance between environmental preservation and the preservation of jobs.""\China leads the world in carbon dioxide emissions, the leading greenhouse gas, with 24 percent of the worldwide total.\That's followed by the U.S. (21 percent), the European Union (12 percent), India (8 percent) and Russia (6 percent), according to an estimate by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.\Charles Wilfong, president of the West Virginia Farm Bureau, told the audience at the Culture Center that cap-and-trade legislation will ""probably be the biggest tax increase in American history.""\Wilfong rejected the ""assumption that global warming is caused by humans...a radical fringe is trying to implement this legislation.""\He added, ""A little under $1 trillion in new taxes over a 10-year period will be spent on social programs supported by the liberal leaders of Congress.""\Kenny Kemp | Sunday Gazette-Mail photos Crystal Newman, husband, Chris, and son Tristen, 10, protest cap-and-trade legislation at the state Capitol Saturday.\People at the rally were encouraged to send e-mails to Sen.

42,"GOV. Manchin is a relentless optimist. He believes the merits of his argument combined with the force of his personality can ultimately bring skeptics and opponents over to his way of thinking. \MoJo is West Virginia's salesman-in-chief.\Thursday, he took his pitch for coal to the White House. He and governors from a dozen other energy states met behind closed doors with President Obama, Vice President Biden and top members of his administration to talk about the nation's energy strategy.\Manchin's pitch: Coal is crucial to the long-term energy needs of the country. Cap-and-trade will be ruinous for West Virginia's economy. West Virginia needs the EPA to be clearer about rules for mountaintop removal mining.\""It was the most honest, frank, respectful dialogue I've ever had at that level,"" Manchin told me on Metronews Talkline a day after the meeting.\Manchin appeared hopeful Obama and his people had heard him.\But did they?\The president came out of the meeting with a commitment to clean coal technology and the construction of five to 10 carbon capture and sequestration demonstration projects by 2016.\That sounds like a small carrot, which is attached to a considerably larger stick.\That stick is cap-and-trade legislation; Pass cap-and-trade or a carbon tax and there will be a few billion for clean coal.\The same day Manchin and the other governors were meeting with President Obama, Carol Browner, the administration's ""Climate Czar"" was touting carbon taxes to representatives of renewable energy companies.\The message is clear: Tax carbon-based fuels such as coal and oil and use the money to prop up green energy firms.\The New York Times reports that Browner used the words ""cap"" and ""price signal"" several times, and told the group that President Obama is not backing away from his commitment to a carbon trading system.\Browner said carbon caps would reduce ""dangerous pollutants that contribute to global warming"" and create jobs in a new green economy.\Not in West Virginia, however.\A study by the WVU Bureau of Business and Economic Research released last month found that the House of Representatives' version of cap-and-trade would cost the state almost 23,000 jobs and $1.8 billion in gross domestic product by 2030.\Browner wasn't alone.\The Times reported that Undersecretary of Energy Kristina Johnson told conferees: ""Let's not give up the fight"" for a ""comprehensive energy and climate bill.""\I'm not sure exactly what Manchin was told by President Obama and others in the administration during their meeting, but we do know what the people in charge of the president's environment and energy policies are saying when they're not locked in a room of coal state governors.\Their views should be enough to dampen even Gov. Manchin's dogged optimism."
43,"West Virginia's two U.S. senators said Wednesday there's a long way to go before they will vote for environmental legislation that could hurt the state's coal industry. \Sen. Robert Byrd and Sen. Jay Rockefeller, both Democrats, indicated they could not support new Senate legislation that would limit, or cap, companies' right to release carbon dioxide and set up a system to trade rights to emit the gas.\The House passed a bill earlier this summer that included such a ""cap and trade"" system, which is meant to reduce the emission of the gas many scientists say is causing global climate change.\The new 821-page Senate bill, introduced by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., tries to rebrand that cap and trade system as the ""Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act.""\The bill's stated goal is to ""create clean energy jobs, promote energy independence, reduce global warming pollution and transition to a clean energy economy.""\But both West Virginia senators said it would hurt the coal industry.\Rockefeller, who coal industry officials and environmentalists say is fence sitting, was blunt in his assessment.\""The climate legislation proposed today by Senators Boxer and Kerry is a disappointing step in the wrong direction and I am against it,"" the senator said in a statement.\He said the bill's call for a 20 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2020 was ""unrealistic and harmful.""\Byrd's position is similar.\""I will continue to work with my colleagues to strike a balance that treats West Virginia's interests fairly as the legislative process moves forward,"" Byrd said in a statement.\""However, I will actively oppose any bill that would harm the workers, families, industries or our resource-based economy in West Virginia.""\Byrd said he was glad to see the bill put ""greater focus"" on clean coal technology.\""While this is an encouraging sign, we have a long way to go on this legislation,"" Byrd said. ""Many issues have yet to be addressed. There is still a tough road ahead.""\Both West Virginia senators are also pushing for the bill to encourage more energy efficiency and provide more funding for ""clean coal"" technologies, like carbon capture and storage, which could allow power companies to continue burning coal without emitting as much carbon dioxide. Much of that technology is so far unproven on a large scale.\Rockefeller and other senators from coal-producing states are likely to try to make the climate change bill more favorable to coal.\""I will continue studying the bill and all of its implications for our state and the coal industry,"" Rockefeller said. ""This is by no means the defining word on climate legislation in the Senate.""\West Virginia's senators stand in stark contrast to other Senate Democrats who spent Wednesday trying out a new catch phrase to sell their global warming bill: pollution reduction and investment, or PRI.\But it's just another name for cap and trade, a term derided by Republican critics as ""cap and tax"" because it will increase energy prices. Democratic polls have shown it faring poorly with voters.\The rebranding is an indication of the uphill battle the climate bill - which would cap greenhouse gases and also allow industries to buy emission allowances - faces in the Senate.\A number of Democratic senators, currently entangled in the heated health care debate, said they continued to have trouble with key elements of the climate legislation. Several said it would be a huge challenge - perhaps impossible - to try to get a climate bill passed this year.\The idea to remake ""cap and trade"" into ""pollution reduction and investment"" came from Kerry, author of the bill unveiled Wednesday. He came up with it about a month ago to refocus attention on what the bill would do, not how it goes about doing it.\""Cap and trade doesn't mean anything to people, "" Kerry said in an interview, insisting that ""this is an actual description of what's happening here.""\At a news conference on the bill, cap and trade, the legislation's centerpiece, got nary a mention. Instead, the buzz words were ""national security,"" ""economic growth"" and ""jobs from clean energy development.""\""We are here and we introduced this legislation because of one word - security,"" said Kerry. ""It is time to reinvent the way Americans use energy.""\The words ""cap and trade,"" ""global warming"" and ""climate"" also didn't appear in a White House statement responding to the bill's introduction.\""With the draft legislation ... we are one step closer to putting America in control of our energy future and making America more energy independent,"" President Barack Obama said. ""My administration is deeply committed to passing a bill that creates new American jobs and the clean energy incentives that foster innovation.""\Cap and trade is still the centerpiece of the Senate bill, as it is in the House-passed version. Under cap and trade, emissions of heat-trapping gases from power plants, refineries and factories would face increasingly more stringent limits, or caps. Companies could then invest in pollution-reducing technologies, or buy and sell permits to meet the cap - the trade portion.\The bill calls for a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020, and an 80 percent cut by mid-century.\Environmentalists said Wednesday that all along they had been touting the energy security and jobs that would come from the bill.\""We don't even talk about it in terms of cap and trade,"" said Anna Aurilio, director of Environment America. ""Cap and trade is a very confusing term and it is not accurate. What we are doing is reducing pollution.""\Republican critics, who frequently have referred to the House-passed bill as ""cap and tax"" maintaining it would lead to soaring energy prices, weren't about to join in on the rhetorical shift.\""These are fancy, complicated words for high-cost energy,"" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn.\Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., a strong critic of climate legislation, said Kerry and Boxer were making ""an earnest attempt ... to refashion the obvious"" but that they ""produced yet another massive energy tax that will destroy jobs (and) raise electricity and gasoline prices.""\Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., called the Democratic bill a ""cap and trade scheme"" that ""would suppress our economic recovery, cost jobs across our economy and result in higher prices on everything from energy to food for every single American.""\The Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, put additional pressure on Congress to address climate change by announcing that for the first time it will regulate carbon dioxide releases from new power plants, factories and refineries or whenever they are significantly expanded. Supporters of the climate legislation have argued Congress should act to avoid less flexible action by the EPA."
44,"Wisconsin's two U.S. senators wisely voted against a sneaky attempt to ram cap-and-trade legislation through the Senate this month.\Sens. Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold joined 24 other Democrats and all 41 Republicans in rejecting a procedural move that would have limited debate and amendments - and prevented a filibuster - on this complex issue.\Climate change is a serious threat that requires a broad range of action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A cap-and-trade system that essentially taxes carbon energy may be justified if it's designed carefully with the environment and the economy in mind. Such a system could significantly boost cleaner energy alternatives and technology.\But rushing such sweeping policy through the Senate using a procedural trick intended only for narrow budget action would be wrong.\""We have to take a look at what's in proposals and how it impacts the economy and jobs in the (Midwest), where we have so much coal to get our energy,"" Kohl told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""That's a very complicated thing.""\Feingold said in a written statement that the parliamentary procedure in question, called ""reconciliation,"" has a narrow purpose - deficit reduction - that doesn't apply to cap and trade.\""I have strongly opposed past efforts to use reconciliation to address policy matters, such as drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,"" Feingold said. ""It wasn't appropriate then. It isn't appropriate now.""\That means cap and trade will need at least 60 votes to ensure passage, rather than a bare majority of 50.\If designed well, cap-and-trade legislation could cap carbon emissions and require those companies that exceed the cap to buy or trade credits. It would use market-based principles rather than inflexible regulations.\But if designed poorly, Wisconsin and other states that rely heavily on coal for energy to power homes, businesses and manufacturing plants could be socked with fat bills that further stall the economy.\Kohl and Feingold wisely helped stop their Democratic colleagues from short-circuiting the process for debate and refinement. A rush job of federal legislation that batters Wisconsin's economy isn't the answer."
45," Announcing a new, market-driven air pollution control program yesterday, the chief of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said the plan would help rid Maryland of persistent smog that threatens the health of one in three state residents.\ But state officials, pollution experts and environmentalists disagreed, saying that the plan won't guarantee a solution to Maryland's worst air pollution problem: a stream of gases and particles flowing east from old, coal-burning power plants in the Midwest.\ The EPA announced its program on the same day it informed 534 jurisdictions, including Baltimore City and 14 Maryland counties, that they're violating tough new health standards for smog-forming ozone, scheduled to be phased in over the next two decades.\ Baltimore City and its five surrounding counties were all listed as potential violators, along with Prince George's, Montgomery, Cecil, Kent, Queen Anne's, Calvert, Charles, Frederick and Washington counties.\ Maryland and 31 other states have until April 2007 to figure out how to clean their air in order to meet the new standards, which are aimed at reducing rates of chronic respiratory diseases and heart problems.\ The new standard has been in the works since the 1990s, when the American Lung Association and environmental groups successfully sued the EPA to set standards strict enough to protect the public health.\ Maryland, which has some of the country's worst ozone pollution, was never able to meet the old, more lenient standard.\ ""The biggest problem we've got is ozone transport from out of state,"" said Kendl P. Philbrick, acting secretary of the Maryland Department of the Environment.\ In a letter to the EPA in July, Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. said Maryland's own pollution reductions are ""inseparable"" from equally steep cuts in the Midwest. He asked the federal agency to explain how it would force upwind states to clean their air.\ `They ignored it'\ In unusually harsh criticism from a Republican statehouse to a Republican White House, MDE's Philbrick said the government's reply, issued yesterday, did not address that issue.\ ""They ignored it,"" Philbrick said in an interview.\ But EPA Administrator Michael O. Leavitt, who took office in October, said the Bush administration considers the proposed pollution trading program, known as the Interstate Air Quality rule, an effective reply to the concerns of Maryland and other downwind states.\ Leavitt said the new program was unveiled on the same day as the list of communities that won't meet the standard because ""it would be unfair to put the [list] out without having a solution.""\ The administration is proposing a ""cap and trade"" program, similar to one already used to reduce acid rain. This new ""cap"" would set nationwide limits on power plant emissions of two common pollutants, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.\ Both can cause breathing problems on their own. Sulfur dioxide is also a component of acid rain, while nitrogen oxide contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone, or smog - a powerful respiratory irritant.\ The EPA wants to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 70 percent by 2015 and would cut nitrogen oxide by 40 percent.\ The ""trade"" portion of the program would allow utilities that can reduce pollution below target levels to sell the excess reductions as pollution credits. Companies that can't meet the goals would be able to comply by buying these credits, even if they don't actually reduce pollutants.\ ""This is the largest air pollution reduction in more than a decade,"" Leavitt said. Power plants would have to install new equipment at a cost of about $5.7 billion, he said.\ Leavitt, a former governor of Utah, said the proposal should satisfy officials in Eastern states who ""could close every power plant, in their mind, and take every car off the road, and still not achieve the reductions.""\ Regional remedies\ But Philbrick said Maryland has already told the EPA that the state opposes a cap-and-trade program without region-by-region reductions. Otherwise, he said, ""I don't think it's helpful,"" because it would allow Midwestern utilities to buy credits instead of cleaning up their plants.\ Air pollution professionals and environmentalists called the EPA proposal a back-door scheme to implement a Bush Administration plan to revise the Clean Air Act. The Bush plan, known as the ""Clear Skies Initiative,"" bogged down in Congress after critics charged that it would weaken the nation's principal air pollution law.\ States that don't meet the new standards could lose federal highway funds, a sanction that environmentalists concede is rarely imposed.\ Credit: SUN STAFF"
46,"Gov. Jerry Brown has found a new pot of money to help him fill a $9-billion hole in his proposed budget: $1 billion from auctioning credits to allow California companies to emit greenhouse gases.\But business groups are already denouncing Brown's plan as a back-door tax increase that they intend to challenge in court if the proposal is approved as part of the state budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1.\""At a time when the public is concerned about jobs and the economy, the budget proposes a new tax on California businesses for climate change activities,"" said Dorothy Rothrock, vice president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Assn.\""The anticipated $1 billion is not windfall revenue. The funds will be paid by California employers suffering the worst recession since the Great Depression,"" she said.\The so called cap-and-trade system is a critical piece of AB 32, California's landmark legislation aimed at cutting carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Modeled on a European program, it sets a cap on emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases for each industrial polluter or electric power plant. Facilities can exceed their cap only if they buy credits of other plants that have extra ones after reducing their own releases into the atmosphere.\The first auction, tentatively set for August, is projected to raise as much as $1 billion, which would be earmarked to ""create jobs and deliver public health, economic and environmental benefits"" as part of the state's effort to curb global warming, the governor's office said.\Brown's 2012-13 budget summary, released Thursday, dedicated three of its 173 pages to a bare-bones plan to use the auction proceeds to pay for a variety of environmental programs.\But business groups representing steel mills, cement plants, refineries and other heavy industries say such spending is not authorized by AB 32 and is probably unconstitutional.\At issue is whether the money paid by polluters to buy credits is a fee or a tax.\The difference is important because tax increases or changes require the approval of a two-thirds super-majority of members in both the California Senate and Assembly. But a simple majority of lawmakers can set fees on industries.\Money collected from the firms can be spent only on activities that are closely related to regulation of a specific business, such as conducting a health inspection at a restaurant.\Reinforcing the principle of a tight linkage between a fee and how it is spent was enshrined in the state Constitution when voters approved Proposition 26, an industry-backed initiative, in 2010.\Such a connection clearly exists, the Brown administration said, noting that it plans to spend the auction proceeds in four broadly defined areas: clean and efficient energy, low-cost transportation, natural resource protection and sustainable infrastructure development.\""These are the types of programs spelled out in broad strokes in AB 32,"" said H.D. Palmer, a spokesman for the governor's Department of Finance.\What's more, some AB 32 supporters contend, the extra $1 billion in environmental fees -- even if they are considered taxes -- are not overly onerous since California's total corporate tax bite is on par with the U.S. average, according to a recent survey by the Council on State Taxation. Total corporate taxes are higher in Alaska, New York, Florida and even Texas, says the report by the business-friendly group.\Exactly how the proposed environmental auction money might be spent won't be clear until more than a year from now, although some of it could be used to pay for existing environmental programs, freeing up the money for other purposes, Palmer said.\Environmentalists generally support the governor's plan because it could lead to a net increase in spending on their favorite projects.\""Much as we hate to see it, some backfilling [for existing programs] is going to happen,"" said Jim Metropulos, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, who called the governor's plan for spending auction receipts ""a good thing.""\For now, Brown's cap-and-trade spending proposal is too vague to draw any conclusions, said Tiffany Roberts, a specialist in environment and natural resource programs at the California Legislative Analyst's Office.\""Who knows if this can pass legal muster?"" she said. ""Until we see some kind of proposal, it's guesswork.""\--\marc.lifsher@latimes.com"
47,"Maine and nine other northeastern states will break new ground Thursday with the launch of a regional effort to fight global warming.\The effort - called a cap-and-trade program - means large power plants that want to discharge carbon dioxide after this year will have to buy pollution allowances from the states or from each other.\The carbon market will open for business Thursday, when Maine and some of the other states hold an Internet-based auction that will be watched around the country.\""This is the wave of the future and we're going to be on the cutting edge of it,"" said Michael Stoddard of Environment Northeast, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization focused on environmental concerns.\No one knows for sure what the market price for allowances will be Thursday, or how soon the cap-and-trade system will lead to actual cutbacks in pollution. But state officials, conservationists and power generators say it is a historic step that might lead to a broader national program.\""Certainly, one of the biggest things we were trying to do is serve as a national model and sort of lead by example,"" said Jim Brooks, director of the air bureau for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. ""It has spurred a lot of discussion all across the country.""\Both major presidential candidates have said they support a national cap-and-trade system to cut pollution, and states in other regions of the country are considering their own versions.\Maine and the other northeastern states have been working for five years to create the program known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI (pronounced ""reggie"").\Starting in 2009, the region's 233 largest power plants will need one allowance for each ton of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from burning coal, oil or natural gas. The entire region is capped at 188 million tons each year for the next six years, and each state gets to sell a portion of the allowances depending on the capacity of its power plants.\Starting in 2014, the overall cap will then decrease 2.5 percent each year, for a 10 percent reduction by 2019, making the allowances increasingly scarce and hard to get.\In Maine, six power plants are covered by the program and awaiting Thursday's initial auction. Maine will have 6 million tons of carbon dioxide allowances to sell the first year, and it will put a little less than 1 million on the auction block Thursday, with the remainder being available for distribution at future auctions.\As the new market is established and power companies figure out what the allowances will cost them, Mainers can expect to see electricity rates climb from 1 percent to 3 percent, according to the DEP. That could add $1 to $3 a month to the power bill of a typical household.\But state officials and advocates expect customers to ultimately save money because of how the proceeds will be used. Maine stands to earn $10 million to nearly $30 million a year from the sale of the allowances, and will put most of the revenues into energy efficiency programs that could help consumers reduce their electricity usage or heating bills.\A trust set up by the Maine Legislature has yet to decide how to distribute the money for conservation.\The cap-and-trade system eventually will force the region's dirtiest power generators to improve or shut down, and it will immediately make cleaner alternatives more attractive to investors, Stoddard said.\""Carbon pollution carries a cost to our environment, and now that cost is being reflected in market prices,"" he said. ""All those alternatives will be a little more competitive.""\The program, which is similar to programs in Europe, is administered by a nonprofit based in New York.\The auction on Thursday and the others that will follow - there will be six in the first year - will be done electronically, with buyers not knowing who else is placing bids.\State officials will not release any results from the first auction until they are officially certified, probably Sunday or Monday, according to the DEP.\Some observers have been predicting a weak demand at Thursday's auction as power generators take a wait-and-see approach. Also, there is not expected to be any shortage of allowances in the first year, at least, because mild weather and high energy costs have reduced overall demand for power.\On the other hand, a cold winter or a rebounding economy could increase power generation - and the demand for pollution allowances, observers said. And no one knows whether some private buyers will place bids as a way to keep allowances out of the hands of the power plants to prevent pollution.\""I hope that we have brisk trading. We're predicting anywhere from $2 to $5"" for each one-ton allowance, Brooks said.\""The generators in Maine could choose to sit on the sidelines for this first auction or they could dip their toes in just to get the experience,"" Stoddard said.\Spokesmen for the power plants weren't revealing their plans.\""We're certainly anxious to partake in the auction and see how it all works out,"" said Al Wiley of Florida Power & Light, owner of the Wyman Station power plant in Yarmouth.\At the same time, there will be plenty more opportunities to buy, he said.\Like other Maine generators, Florida Power & Light has generally supported the program while also saying it should include all carbon dioxide sources - not just large power plants - and should not be limited to just one region of the country.\""If you really want to deal with climate change in an appropriate way,"" Wiley said, ""you really ought to broaden your influence.""\Staff Writer John Richardson can be contacted at 791-6324 or at:\jrichardson@pressherald.com\[Sidebar]\THE PROGRAM\THE REGIONAL Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, requires large power-generating plants in 10 northeastern states to buy one allowance for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the atmosphere starting in 2009.

The overall number of allowances will be capped for six years and then gradually reduced, making it increasingly expensive to pollute and forcing the dirtiest plants to improve or shut down.

48,"California's cap-and-trade program to restrict greenhouse gas emissions has hit a major political roadblock. Extending the current program beyond its 2020 expiration most likely requires new action on the part of the Legislature, and majority support looks dubious. And even a majority might not be enough. Many legal and policy analysts believe the state's cap-and-trade regime is functionally a tax, and that reauthorizing and extending it requires a two-thirds majority vote of legislators or voters.\The legal case to deem the cap-and-trade program a tax is already in the courts. Four years ago, a business group argued that the program was unconstitutional because it hadn't passed with a two-thirds majority. An appellate court's review of the case amplified the uncertainty around the program's future.\That uncertainty depressed the emissions allowance market that defines the cap-and-trade program. Emissions are capped, and emitters need to purchase enough permits from a state-run auction or on the secondary market to cover their emissions. In the most recent auction of these permits, California sold only 11% of the available supply. The lack of demand to some degree showed that emissions were being successfully capped, but it also called into question the whole scheme and raised much less money for ""green"" projects than expected. On Aug. 16, the state will hold another allowance auction whose results are unlikely to be much better.\Cap and trade, as even this simplified description demon- strates, is a complex program. If California must pass new legislation with a two-thirds majority to extend its climate efforts anyway, policymakers should consider replacing it with a simple straight-up carbon tax. It would provide even more powerful market signals to encourage emissions reductions, serve broader fiscal purposes and thereby make for a better model for federal legislation.\A tax is simpler than cap and trade because it doesn't involve allowance auctions, registries to keep track of who can sell and who must buy, market monitoring or carbon offsets. Emitters just pay a predictable (and gradually rising) fee for each ton of carbon dioxide they emit, not unlike the tax on a pack of cigarettes. Even a modest tax is likely to be more environmentally effective than the current approach because it is a direct and predictable incentive to lower emissions and use cleaner technology. Under cap and trade, California's other clean energy regulations do much of the work to prod emitters to meet the cap; the trading system just picks up the slack.\As the business groups that filed suit noticed, the California program has been acting like a tax already, but with constraints written into the program on how the revenues can be used. For most of its history, its emissions allowances have sold at or very near the minimum fixed price dictated by the state. The revenues fund a range of green measures, notably Gov. Jerry Brown's signature high-speed rail initiative. An actual carbon tax could bolster a wider array of programs and allow for tax cuts, making California an even more competitive economic dynamo.\Cap and trade has lowered emissions in California and it's still a popular policy for many, but in Congress, it's increasingly viewed as complex, subject to manipulation and giveaways, and as an engine for the expansion of government. By contrast, a tax strategy is gaining traction.\Although carbon tax bills introduced by Democrats haven't yet attracted Republican support, a number of Republicans express off-the-record openness to a deal that taxes carbon and also supplants EPA regulations, reduces other taxes and offsets impacts on low-income citizens, for example via expansions in the earned income tax credit or targeted rebates. But those Republicans also fear the political consequences of stepping forward before the right political moment. California's leadership could help foster that moment.\California's policymakers have thought this way before. In 2006, national cap-and-trade was a serious prospect in Congress. California's leaders -- especially Sen. Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills) and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger -- pushed hard for the state policy model they thought the nation would emulate. Now, seven years after cap and trade died in Washington, the situation in California creates an opportunity to redirect the state toward another approach that the nation may follow.\The latest state poll indicates that 69% of Californians approve of the state law to reduce emissions. Still, getting to a two-thirds majority on any policy is never easy. Whether for cap and trade or a tax, the effort will require genuine bipartisan bargaining or a very compelling proposition to voters. The inevitable hard work should not just maintain the current approach for its own sake. A well-designed carbon tax alternative could reclaim the mantle of national climate leadership for California, while also assuring continued emissions reductions, simplifying the state's regulations and burnishing its reputation as a place to do business.\Credit: Michael Wara is an associate professor of energy and environmental law at Stanford Law School.

49,"After six years of preparation, California is poised to become the first state to combat global warming by capping greenhouse gas emissions and making major polluters pay to release more of these gases into the atmosphere.\It's part of a landmark law approved in 2006 that seeks to cut the state's production of carbon dioxide, methane and related gases to 1990 levels -- about 17% lower than current amounts -- by 2020.\Starting next week, big polluters will be required to buy pollution credits if they plan to emit greenhouse gases above their allotted levels.\On Nov. 14, the state is scheduled to launch the market-based cap-and-trade program of selling pollution credits at auction.\This year, the program covers about 350 industrial businesses operating a total of 600 facilities throughout the state. They include cement plants, steel mills, food processors, electric utilities and refineries. Starting in 2015, the program will also cover distributors of natural gas and other fuels.\These businesses have been issued free credits worth 90% of their recent emissions. Now they must either cut their greenhouse gas production to that level or buy credits to make up the difference. Companies that have more credits than they need can sell them at the auction, and the state will sell additional credits as well.\But with the state's first sale of pollution credits just days away, businesses that oppose the program are still trying to derail it. At a minimum, they are asking for free credits worth 100% of their recent needs, not just 90%.\Opponents are petitioning Gov. Jerry Brown, lawmakers and regulators. An industrial coalition is running newspaper and radio advertising campaigns, saying that cap-and-trade is ""a multibillion-dollar, hidden energy tax"" that will drive California's already high energy prices even higher.\The state's requirement to buy pollution credits ""will impose high and unnecessary costs on California businesses, threatening jobs and tax revenues in the state,"" the industrial coalition, AB 32 Implementation Group, said in an Oct. 16 letter to Brown. ""All California's consumers will feel the impacts of higher costs for fuel, utilities, food and other essential goods and services.""\The biggest problem, the group contends, is that the California-only regulations are expected to cause ""leakage"" of jobs by driving businesses to neighboring states that put no limits on greenhouse gas emissions.\Regardless, the state has made it clear that it's moving ahead with the long-planned cap-and-trade approach.\""The auction will take place on Nov. 14,"" said Gareth Lacy, a spokesman for the governor.\The approach ""is a reasonable, well-thought-out program with rigorous reporting, monitoring and enforcement ... while protecting California's business and jobs,"" Matt Rodriquez, head of the state's Environmental Protection Agency, said at a recent conference in San Diego on industry and the environment.\The upcoming auction of credits is one of the most controversial parts of the Global Warming Solutions Act, the 2006 law known as AB 32.\Each credit allows the release of one metric ton of greenhouse gases. (For comparison, a typical passenger vehicle produces about five metric tons per year.) The California Air Resources Board, which is overseeing the quarterly auctions, has set a minimum bid of $10 per credit, and it predicts that the price could rise to as much as $50 over the next eight years.\The system probably will prove expensive for Cal Portland Co., a Glendora cement maker with plants in Colton and Mojave. The two plants are expected produce about 1 million tons of greenhouse gases this year.\""We're projecting in 2013 that we're going to see a direct increase in costs of somewhere between $2 million and $5 million per year. It's a significant percentage of our costs,"" said Steve Regis, Cal Portland's vice president for corporate services. The company also expects the credits system to cause big hikes in the cost of electricity, which it uses to run furnaces to bake limestone and other cement ingredients to more than 1,600 degrees.\""Our concern is, we may no longer manufacture in California,"" Regis warned. ""We'd ... bring it in from overseas or out of state.""\Another unhappy company is Pacific Coast Producers, a farmer-owned cooperative that has a tomato canning plant in Woodland, northwest of Sacramento.\Buying the credits it needs through 2020 would add as much as $2.5 million to the cost of canning tomatoes, Vice President Mona Shulman predicted.\""This is a cost for a product that's being imposed on us that's not being imposed on our competitors"" out of state and overseas, she said. ""Adding a penny a pound does make a difference in a global market for a product like ours.""\California's cap-and-trade system is much more comprehensive and ambitious than the only other greenhouse gas auction in the country. A 10-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, begun in 2009 in the Northeast, covers only electric power plants. Trading in Europe proved to be flawed when started in 2005 but has been substantially overhauled since then.\The Golden State's carbon market and its entire effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions won't directly put a significant dent in global warming because the state contributes less than 2% of worldwide emissions, said Severin Borenstein, executive director of the UC Energy Institute.\""But California is creating a model for a cap-and-trade that can work,"" Borenstein said. ""Potentially, it could provide an example that other countries and larger organizations of countries could adopt, while we work out some of the kinks along the way.""\--\marc.lifsher@latimes.com"

(Question of the Week, July 17):\We need to include the environmental costs in the price of fossil carbon. Unfortunately, the cap-and-trade approach being taken by California is not the best.\A fee and dividend plan is needed. A fee is placed on fossil carbon where it is extracted from the Earth or enters the state. The money is then returned to the people equally. With fee and dividend, the poor are protected because the dividend covers the increased costs.\Most people come out about even; only those who use far more carbon than average pay much, and they have the means to change their habits. The wonderful thing is that the plan increases jobs and GDP.\If California adopts such a plan, others will need to follow or fall behind economically.\- Dr. James A.

51,"State Assemblymember Chad Mayes is suing California over a ballot measure that could help Republican lawmakers influence how the state spends its climate change funds, claiming that misleading language written by the state's Democratic attorney general will confuse voters so they oppose the measure in June.\Proposition 70 stems from a hard-fought deal between Mayes and Gov. Jerry Brown last year. In exchange for Mayes delivering Republican votes to extend California's cap-and-trade program, which puts a price on planet-warming emissions, Brown and Sacramento Democrats agreed to a statewide vote that could change how funds generated by the program are spent. If Prop 70 passes, the Legislature will be required to approve some of that spending in a two-thirds vote, rather than the majority vote that's needed now.\The compromise was politically costly for Mayes, who represents parts of the Coachella Valley and the High Desert, including Palm Springs. He faced intense criticism from conservatives and was forced to step down as leader of the Assembly Republicans.\Now, Mayes says the deal that cost him his leadership post is being undermined by the California's attorney general, Xavier Becerra.\In a lawsuit filed in state court in Sacramento this week, Mayes accused Becerra of describing Proposition 70 in a way that will mislead people into voting against it. The voter information guide written by the attorney general gives the following title for Prop 70: ""Limits Legislature's authority to use cap-and-trade revenue to reduce pollution.""\That's false, Mayes says in his lawsuit: The ballot measure would do nothing to limit the Legislature's authority, and money generated by the climate program would still be spent on projects that reduce pollution. All Prop 70 would do is change the voting threshold on some of those spending decisions from a simple majority to a two-thirds majority.\""The title drafted by the Attorney general falsely and misleadingly implies the Legislature is somehow 'limited' from using those funds to pay for programs to reduce pollution or greenhouse gas emissions,"" the lawsuit states.\Mayes sued California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, who is responsible for preparing and distributing the voter information guide in advance of the June election. The lawsuit also concerns Becerra, since his office actually writes the ballot measures.\Mayes has asked the court to substitute Becerra's description with new language his office has written, which he says more accurately describes Prop 70. Padilla is supposed to submit the finalized voter information guide to be printed on March 12.\The attorney general's office didn't immediately response to a request for comment. Spokespeople for Padilla and Mayes declined to comment.\The cap-and-trade program championed by Gov. Brown requires oil refiners, power plants and other climate polluters to pay a fee for the planet-warming carbon they emit. State officials set an overall cap on the amount of carbon that polluters are allowed to emit in a given year. They enforce the cap by issuing a limited number of ""allowances"" each year, then requiring companies to have enough allowances to cover their pollution. Companies can buy extra allowances from the government or from other polluters.\The goal is to make cutting emissions as inexpensive as possible. Companies that can slash their climate pollution cheaply are able to sell allowances to emitters for whom cutting back would be prohibitively expensive. On the flip side, polluters who can't afford to cut emissions can instead buy allowances. The overall emissions cap — and thus the number of allowances in the marketplace — drops every year, slowly reducing pollution.\The program generates revenue, which is required by state law to be spent on projects that lead to additional cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. So far, Democrats have set aside the biggest chunk of that money — roughly $1 billion — for Brown's high-speed rail project, the bullet train that could one day connect Los Angeles and San Francisco. Republicans have criticized the allocation of cap-and-trade funds for the bullet train, which they see as an expensive boondoggle that isn't worth its $64-billion price tag.\Enter Proposition 70, negotiated by Mayes in exchange for delivering seven Republican votes in the Assembly to extend cap and trade from 2020 to 2030. If the ballot measure is approved by voters in June, money generated by cap and trade starting in 2024 would need to be allocated by two-thirds votes of both houses of the Legislature, rather than majority votes. That could give Republicans a chance to block high-speed rail, if the project hasn't advanced past the point where it can be blocked by then. More broadly, Prop 70 could serve as a check on how Democratic lawmakers spend the climate funds.\""California has said, 'We are going to engage in trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.' That's settled here,"" Mayes told The Desert Sun last year, explaining why he hoped to work with Democrats on cap and trade, even as the Republican Party nationwide has fought efforts to deal with climate change. ""This is about policy. It's about focusing on what the current policy is in California, and how to make the policy better.""\While Mayes has framed Proposition 70 as a significant concession, some conservative activists disagree.\Even if the ballot measure passes, all money generated by cap-and-trade auctions from now until 2024 can still be spent by majority vote of the Legislature. And after a one-time, two-thirds vote on how to spend the funds that start accumulating in 2024, lawmakers would go back to allocating cap-and-trade funds by majority rule.\Even the one-time vote might not do much for Republicans.\Democrats won two-thirds supermajorities in both houses in 2016, and they may still have those margins in 2024.\Joseph Turner — a conservative activist who helped lead the backlash against Mayes over his cap-and-trade deal, and who at one point threatened to protest the Yucca Valley church where Mayes' father preaches — ridiculed Prop 70 in a blog post this week.\Turner wrote that the ballot measure ""was touted as some grand achievement that was going to kill high speed rail and place some checks on those crazy Democrats. Activists like myself saw through the smokescreen and eviscerated this talking point.""\""There isn't even a guarantee that Republicans will even have one third of the seats in either chamber come 2024,"" Turner wrote. ""Is it possible that Mayes, in his haste to be the Republican standing up at the podium with Governor Moonbeam got burned and sold a bill of goods by the Democrats?""\In addition to putting Proposition 70 on the ballot as part of the climate deal, Mayes got Democratic lawmakers to eliminate a fire-prevention fee paid by rural property owners.\Sammy Roth writes about energy and the environment for The Desert Sun.

52,"In a little more than a year, a regional push to cap greenhouse gases has raised millions for Maryland energy programs, with supporters calling it a model for easing climate change on a national or even global scale.\Since September 2008, Maryland and nine other Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states have been participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. In its ""cap and trade"" regulatory scheme, emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants have been capped and plant operators are required to buy permits for all the gas that their facilities release into the atmosphere.\Similar programs, in which businesses buy and sell the rights to release greenhouse gases, are being considered for extension nationwide under legislation in Congress that passed the House last summer and is pending in the Senate. It's also on the table for international action at rancorous United Nations climate talks scheduled to conclude Friday in Copenhagen.\""While Washington and the world debate this in Copenhagen, we've already exercised leadership and proved that cap-and-trade can work, said Malcolm Woolf, director of the Maryland Energy Administration, ""and we are investing the proceeds in helping families and businesses.""\Some business groups and conservative critics have warned that cap-and-trade regulation of greenhouse gases could cripple the U.S. economy, driving energy prices through the roof and putting millions out of work. Some economists and environmentalists also oppose the approach, arguing that it's too complicated and fraught with loopholes to make a real dent in emissions that threaten to drastically alter the world's climate.\But power companies in Maryland and the nine other states have been paying for the rights to emit greenhouse gases for more than a year with slight impact on consumers' electric bills. Baltimore Gas and Electric Co.'s residential customers are paying perhaps $1.25 a month more as the costs of the carbon-dioxide permits are passed through, said Constellation Energy spokesman John Quinn. That represents about 1 percent of the average household's electric bill.\Meanwhile, the state has collected more than $96 million in revenue from the six carbon-dioxide auctions held since September 2008, with the funds earmarked for providing relief from energy costs and ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\Specifically, half the funds this year go to help poor families pay their power bills, while nearly a quarter goes to provide a bit of rate relief for all residential utility customers - about 43 cents on the typical household power bill this winter, according to Quinn.\Another 18 percent goes into promoting energy efficiency and conservation, with an additional 6 percent earmarked to provide grants and low-interest loans for homes and businesses to install ""clean"" energy systems.\Frank and Lois Bohdal are among more than 600 Marylanders this year who have received state grants funded in part with carbon-auction proceeds to help them put in home solar, wind or geothermal energy systems.\Bohdal, a computer programmer with the state comptroller's office, has blanketed the south-facing roof of the couple's Millersville rancher with 40 solar panels. They cost a total of $55,000 - but the state helped cover their installation with nearly $14,000 in grants. And the electricity they generate has reduced the couple's power bill by nearly a third.\""So far, it's been worthwhile to me,"" said Bohdal, who notes that he was able to cover about half the upfront costs with federal and local tax credits.\Some of the carbon-auction funds also are going into retrofitting low-income apartment complexes with better insulation and energy-efficient appliances and lighting. The state recently awarded grants to fix up the 158-unit Sierra Woods apartments in Columbia and another complex in Montgomery County. Using the auction proceeds and federal stimulus funds, the state hopes to work on nearly 1,600 apartments this year.\""We do believe that in the long haul it will help make these properties and the rents more sustainable for our residents,"" said Pat Silvester of the state Department of Housing and Community Development, which is overseeing the projects.\The regional effort in the East has inspired similar collaborations of states in the Midwest and the West, and supporters believe it helped build support on Capitol Hill for the cap-and-trade plan to curb greenhouse gases that is written into the bill that passed the House in June. A similar approach is being considered in the Senate.\But some note that the greenhouse gas initiative wasn't much of a test of the idea of using the market to achieve pollution reductions, since states purposely set their caps on carbon dioxide above what power plants were emitting at the time. The price of pollution allowances sold by the states have ranged between $2 and $3.50 per ton, while the Environmental Protection Agency estimates carbon credits would sell initially for $12 to $15 per ton under the more sweeping cap-and-trade approach in the House bill. A congressional budget analysis found that the cost per household in higher energy bills would average $175 a year.\Maryland officials say the states intentionally set a loose-fitting ceiling on carbon-dioxide emission for the first few years so power plants could get used to paying for pollution allowances.\The plan is to gradually reduce the allowable emissions 10 percent by 2018, ultimately making the allowances more valuable, and costly.\Bids for the carbon credits through six auctions have been within the range projected by the states, but they've trended downward lately. In the most recent auction Dec. 2, carbon dioxide allowances went for $2.05 each, down from a high of $3.51 per ton in March. And for the first time two weeks ago, the states were unable to sell all the allowances they had put up for bid on future emissions.\Karen Palmer, an economist with the Washington think tank Resources for the Future, said bidding appears to have cooled on the regional carbon auctions partly because of uncertainty about how it would be affected by federal legislation. The bill that passed the House would effectively replace the regional power-plant curbs with a nationwide cap on all greenhouse gases, though the pollution credits sold under the regional auctions could still be used to help meet the new, more rigorous federal control scheme.\Another reason for declining bids, Palmer said, is the slumping national economy, which has reduced the demand for carbon-dioxide permits now. Power plant emissions have declined as the business downturn lowered demand for energy, she pointed out.\With recent auction proceeds less than projected, that's forced the states to pare back what they can expect to get and spend on energy programs. In Maryland, though, Woolf says the drop in carbon-auction proceeds has been made up for by an infusion of federal economic stimulus funds earmarked for energy efficiency and clean energy efforts.\""The ultimate goal was always to demonstrate for the country that a cap-and-trade system could work,"" said Shari T. Wilson, Maryland secretary of the environment. ""Really, that goal has been accomplished.""\Some argue that imposing a tax on carbon would be a better way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They acknowledge, though, that cap-and-trade garnered support, at least initially, from businesses and from many environmentalists.\Charles Komanoff, co-director of the Carbon Tax Center, said some green groups evidently believed the market plan would be a ""stealth"" way to tax carbon, and he contended that businesses were looking to write special deals for themselves into the complicated House bill, which runs to more than 1,000 pages. Senate action has been delayed by debate over health insurance reform, though members also remain split over the bill's economic impact and some even question scientific evidence of climate change.\The regional experience with cap-and-trade has won over Constellation Energy, it seems. ""We were supportive of an experiment,"" said company spokesman Quinn, ""that a market-based system that put money back into solving the problem wasn't a bad idea.""\Now, he added, ""It's time to do a comprehensive program, rather than piecemeal it."" The company's chairman and CEO, Mayo A. Shattuck III, issued a statement at the beginning of the U.N. climate summit supporting an international accord committing the United States and all other countries to reducing global emissions of greenhouse gases.\Credit: tim.wheeler@baltsun.com"
53," Maine's two Republican senators broke ranks and joined Democrats on Wednesday, giving life to an effort to overturn new federal rules for controlling mercury pollution. Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe signed a petition that now has enough signatures to force a full Senate vote on the rules, which will help to determine how much mercury is allowed to drift into Maine in the years ahead.\ The fight is over how strict to make the regulations. The Maine senators and environmentalists contend that the Environmental Protection Agency was too lenient in setting standards for the neurotoxin. State officials say mercury pollution is the primary reason Maine's lakes and freshwater fish are contaminated.\ ""I'm very disappointed in the EPA rule,"" said Collins, who signed the petition along with Snowe to force a full Senate vote. ""It's disturbing, to me, that EPA is proposing such a weak rule.""\ Representatives of the coal-burning power plants that face the regulations say that opponents are trying to derail the country's first standards for mercury.\ ""Frankly, I think it's bad policy to try and stop the first mercury regulations ever because they're not fast enough,"" said Frank Maisano, a lawyer representing the industry. ""It proves the old adage that no good deed toward pollution control goes unpunished.""\ The Senate effort could be largely symbolic, because even advocates acknowledge that it could be opposed in the House and by President Bush. But supporters argued that the vote would put the Senate on record in the contentious debate on air pollution, and could pave the way for success in the future.\ ""I don't know that we'll be successful, but at least we'll . . . shine a spotlight on the EPA,"" Collins said.\ Enactment of the regulation is pending. It was finalized on March 15 and published in the Federal Register. Basically, it aims to reduce mercury emissions about 70 percent by 2018, from about 48 tons per year to 15 tons. The strategy for reaching the goal includes a cap-and-trade system to allow cleaner plants to offset pollution from dirtier plants.\ The complaint from Maine officials and environmental groups is that the Clinton administration, in its waning days, proposed stricter limits under a different strategy, called maximum achievable control technology. Legislative proposals called for a 90 percent reduction by 2010.\ Mainers worry about air pollution because an estimated 80 percent of mercury pollution floats into the state from power plants in the Midwest. Brownie Carson, executive director of the Natural Resources Council of Maine, said the Bush administration's rule would allow three times as much pollution to reach Maine.\ ""It's impossible to overstate how destructive this rule is of public health and the environment because of mercury and other toxic pollution,"" he said.\ The proposed regulation's path has already been controversial. Both the Governmental Accountability Office and the EPA's inspector general criticized the way the rule was drafted. A dozen states, including Maine, filed lawsuits challenging the regulation in court.\ But power-industry representatives argued that the mercury rule should be allowed to reduce pollution under the same strategy that has been used to reduce acid rain.\ ""Had the agency plowed ahead with a mercury `maximum achievable control technology' rule, as critics of the current rule proposed, the resulting regulation would have fallen like a house of cards in a hurricane,"" said Dan Riedinger, spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute.\ The latest congressional effort calls for a joint resolution disapproving of the regulation, which is rare. The last time such a move was successful was in March 2001, when Congress scuttled a Clinton administration rule to prevent workplace injuries.\ To force a vote on the mercury resolution, 30 senators had to sign a petition to send the resolution directly to the Senate floor, rather than through the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee. Collins became the 30th senator, and the first Republican, to sign the petition, followed by Snowe.\ ""The EPA has refused to make any accommodation to those of us who have deeply held concerns regarding this rule,"" Snowe said. ""The stakes are too high for Congress not to have a say.""\ The petition requires a vote within 60 legislative days, which means it could occur before the August recess.\ Forecasts in the Senate are murky. As part of the debate on an energy bill, the Senate rejected proposals to limit emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide or require better mileage from sport-utility vehicles. But even if the resolution passes, the presumption is that the House will oppose the resolution.\ In the House, Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine, and others proposed a companion resolution. But it is much tougher to force a vote in the House, where 218 signatures are needed on such a petition.\ ""In all honesty, prospects in the House are somewhere between slim and none,"" Carson said. And even if it passed both chambers, two-thirds majorities would be needed to override a possible veto.\ Still, Carson applauded Collins and Snowe for forcing the vote.\ ""Senators are going to have to either vote for the health of children and protection of the environment or they're going to be siding with polluting coal and oil plants,"" Carson said.\ Washington Correspondent Bart Jansen can be contacted at 202-488- 1119 or at:\ bjansen@pressherald.com"
54,"Author: Cassandra Sweet\SAN FRANCISCO--California's cap-and-trade program is being threatened by groups of local residents, even after the ambitious climate plan survived an electoral challenge in November.\Communities For A Better Environment, California Communities Against Toxics, Society For Positive Action and other groups and individuals have sued state regulators, claiming the climate plan won't reduce pollution. The plaintiffs argue that industrial facilities should cut their actual emissions, rather than trade rights to pollute.\""All the evidence showed that cap-and-trade programs have failed environmental justice communities,"" said Alegria de la Cruz, an attorney with the Center on Race, Poverty & The Environment, who is representing the plaintiffs. Ms. De la Cruz said the Air Resources Board must ""do some deep thinking on alternatives to the cap-and-trade system.""\The status of the cap-and-trade program, which is part of a plan to lower greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels within a decade, was thrown into doubt after Superior Court Judge Ernest Goldsmith agreed with the plaintiffs in a Jan. 27 ruling. He said the Air Resources Board, which is tasked with lowering air pollution, hadn't conducted an adequate environmental review before it approved the plan.\Judge Goldsmith is scheduled to issue a final ruling in the next few weeks.\The legal challenge to the state's implementation of the climate law, known as AB 32, comes despite California's strong support for environmental legislation. In November, California voters defeated a ballot initiative backed by some oil refiners that sought to delay implementation of the climate law, including the cap-and-trade program, which is scheduled to start in January 2012.\Some of the plaintiffs have had success with environmental lawsuits in the past. For example, Communities For A Better Environment has represented low-income residents in dozens of California administrative proceedings and lawsuits over the years, including a legal action in 2009 that derailed Chevron Corp.'s plans to expand its oil refinery in Richmond, Calif.\Observers and participants said they don't expect the Superior Court to shut down the state's cap-and-trade program, but the case has caused jitters among some environmental groups.\""If the plaintiffs are granted their request, then it would suspend the program,"" said Derek Walker, California climate director at Environmental Defense Fund. He said that would put ""the state in danger of not meeting the 2020 obligation.""\Mr. Walker, whose organization strongly supports cap-and-trade, said he was ""optimistic"" the final court ruling would spare California's emissions-trading program.\Under the program, the Air Resources Board plans to cap most of the state's carbon-dioxide emissions--primarily from power plants, vehicle fuels and heavy industry--and reduce that ceiling over eight years. Companies can trade pollution allowances issued by the state, as well as carbon credits tied to emission-reduction projects, such as forests managed to cut heat-trapping gases.\Carbon-market participants said they expect the court to preserve California's cap-and-trade program, although the final ruling may cause a delay in implementation.\The market for California carbon credits has been ""generally quiet,"" although there has been daily trading activity, said John Battaglia, a carbon broker at Evolution Markets in San Francisco. He added that while uncertainty about the court case may have been weighing on the market, participants have been grappling with other issues, such as the availability of pollution permits and still-pending regulations governing the use of carbon credits.\""The regulations are still evolving,"" Mr. Battaglia said. ""It's just the nature of this nascent market.""\Between $3 billion and $75 billion of California carbon credits and pollution permits are expected to change hands during the eight years of the cap-and-trade program, according to an estimate by CantorCO2e, the environmental markets arm of Cantor Fitzgerald.\Air Resources Board spokesman Stanley Young said the agency is ""moving ahead with implementation of the cap-and-trade program,"" although he declined to discuss the case or whether a final court ruling might affect the program.\Cathy Reheis-Boyd, chief operating officer of the Western States Petroleum Association, an oil industry group whose members will be required to cut emissions, said that while ""there are a lot of business people who would be quite happy"" to see the court sideline the state's cap-and-trade program, she didn't think that was likely to happen.\Credit: By Cassandra Sweet"
55,"When it comes to cutting carbon, what's old, it seems, is new again.\Exelon Corp. executives are using terms like ""cap and trade"" and ""carbon tax"" in describing how they think Illinois should lower its carbon footprint in anticipation of the Environmental Protection Agency's bid to cut greenhouse gases from power plants. \At its first public presentation to Illinois regulators last week, Exelon Corp.'s remarks were brief. \The Chicago-based parent company of Commonwealth Edison presented just three slides that explained how a more than $10-per-ton tax on carbon pollution could aid the company's financially flailing nuclear plants. \""There are a number of factors causing this -- which include low natural gas prices and wind subsidies -- but chief among them is the absence of market mechanisms to value the carbon-free nature of nuclear power,"" said Kathleen Barron, senior vice president of federal and regulatory affairs and wholesale market policy for Exelon. \Asked to clarify Exelon's position, Barron told the Tribune: ""It's not that different from the basic premise of cap and trade. There could be a carbon tax that just taxes the sources of pollution."" \If it sounds familiar, it should. \John Rowe, who retired in 2012 as Exelon's chief executive, spent much of his 28-year utility-running career pushing for legislation that would create a national market for carbon pollution. That effort flamed out in 2010. \Last week, Rowe, 69, told the Tribune we could be looking at Cap and Trade 2.0. ""These things don't really go away,"" Rowe said. ""Old wine gets put into new bottles."" \Many would like to see that old wine poured down the drain. \NRG Energy, which owns four coal plants in the state, has said that voluntarily switching inefficient coal-burning plants to natural gas, augmented by developing renewable energy such as wind and solar power and reducing energy consumption, will lower carbon pollution enough to meet mandates. \Environmental groups say money spent on energy projects should go toward renewables and energy efficiency, not ""technology that powered the past."" \For Rowe, the journey to see federal regulation of greenhouse gases began in the early 1990s, when he was president and chief executive of the New England Electric System. \""This must be a clarion call, not for more bureaucracy or regulation or unnecessary costs, but instead for American ingenuity and creativity, to produce the best and most energy-efficient technology,"" he said in 1993 at a climate conference in Washington. \In 2003, when then-U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., sponsored ill-fated legislation that would have set up a national ""cap and trade"" market for carbon patterned after the 1990 system that limited sulfur dioxide, a component of acid rain, Rowe told the Tribune that he thought the pollutants should be taxed, even if it meant increased costs for consumers. \""I think the climate change problem is real,"" he said. \By 2008, all three presidential contenders favored some form of cap and trade. A trading arrangement seemed so inevitable that Time magazine hailed Chicago Climate Exchange founder Richard Sandor as a hero of the environment for his foresight in founding an exchange for voluntary carbon trading. \The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap and trade system for power plant CO2 emissions, began auctioning emissions permits in 2008. \At the time, the total trading volume for carbon products worldwide was 2.7 billion metric tons valued at $60 billion. A U.S. cap and trade plan, experts said at the time, would triple that market. \By 2009, President Barack Obama proposed a cap and trade plan that would require companies to buy an allowance, or permit, which could be bought and sold for each ton of carbon emitted, priced at $13 to $20 per ton. \But by 2010, cap and trade had collapsed politically. It hit its high-water mark with House passage of the so-called Waxman-Markey bill. But in the wake of a national recession, the proposal couldn't escape its label as a ""jobs killer."" \Shortly thereafter, the Chicago Climate Exchange quietly ceased. Only those with mandated exchanges like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and California continue to trade in carbon. \But at least one proponent of the concept hasn't given up. \""I think when you take a state like Illinois, with all its attention deficit problems and revenue problems, a modest carbon tax would be a wonderful way to try to comply with the EPA rules,"" Rowe reiterated last week. He said the taxes generated could be used to fund education or pensions. \It stands to reason that Exelon would favor taxing carbon emissions. Its six nuclear plants in Illinois don't emit carbon, while such a tax would hit competitors whose plants burn coal and natural gas. \Exelon's nuclear plants, along with others, are struggling to compete. A carbon tax or cap and trade plan looks more like a lifeline. The EPA estimates that 6 percent of the 100 nuclear reactors in the United States are threatened with closing. \The EPA's aggressive goals of 30 percent greenhouse gas reductions from 2005 levels by 2030 give states like Illinois an incentive to keep Exelon's nuclear plants in the state open. \Exelon's Barron told regulators last week that about 43 percent of Exelon's nuclear generation is at risk. \The EPA's so-called carbon rule gives states any number of ways to comply with the proposed law. Illinois can choose to go it alone or team with other states on a regional approach. \That would buy Illinois more time and save the Midwest region an estimated $3 billion annually in compliance costs, according to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which controls the part of the electrical grid that includes most of Illinois. \Exelon said it supports a ""regional"" approach to cutting carbon, a major contributor to greenhouse gases and climate change, saying it believes it would be cheaper for consumers if states work together within their regional transmission organizations. \Barron said she envisions carbon taxes collected from sources of pollution and credited back to customers. That, she said, would help offset the inevitable expense that would come as coal plants shut down, switch to natural gas or pass along the costs associated with those taxes to consumers. \David Brown, senior vice president of federal government affairs at Exelon, said most of the utility sector would have preferred a national approach to the varied cap-and-tradelike plans that may arise out of the carbon rule. \He said he can imagine a ""slim"" chance the utility sector will join forces to return to Capitol Hill for legislation that beckons the return of a plan similar to Waxman-Markey. \The question remains -- is Illinois ready to return to the days of cap and trade? \Rowe said he expects that states won't be ready to jump on board just yet. Maybe they would, he said, five years from now. \""We can't help ourselves. We're America,"" he said. ""If there's an expensive way to solve the problem, we try that first."" \---------- \jwernau@tribune.com \Twitter @littlewern\Credit: By Julie Wernau, Tribune reporter"
56,"A one-year-old regional experiment with carbon cap-and-trade has so far generated $13.5 million for energy conservation efforts in Maine.\But it could ultimately have a far bigger impact, in Maine and nationwide.\A much more ambitious cap-and-trade plan introduced in the U.S. Senate last week is based, at least in part, on the lessons learned here.\""The hope ... was that it would influence the national policy,"" said Thomas Tietenberg, a retired Colby College economics professor who helped develop Maine's piece of the program. ""And I think it did.""\Maine was one of 10 states to create the nation's first market-based system to fight climate change. By putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions, it encourages large power plants to become cleaner and more efficient.\It's too early to measure any effects on pollution or on electricity prices, especially given a recession that has reduced production - and thus emissions - far more than any government action.\The program has its flaws, including a cap on emissions that turned out to be too generous. But it also is seen as an innovative way to fight climate change, and as a model.\""Clearly (it) has established that a cap-and-trade system can work and work very well in the United States,"" said David Littell, commissioner of Maine's Department of Environmental Protection. ""Before that, people were skeptical.""\The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, was effectively launched in September 2008 with the first carbon allowance auction in the United States.\RGGI, which is pronounced ""Reggie,"" requires large electricity producers in the Northeast to have one allowance for every ton of carbon dioxide they put into the atmosphere from burning coal, oil or gas. They can either buy the allowances at quarterly government auctions or trade among themselves.\The basic idea is that the power industry has a new incentive to shift to cleaner-burning fuels, such as gas, and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that scientists say contribute to global warming.\The other principle behind cap-and-trade systems is that the number of overall allowances in the marketplace - the cap - will gradually be reduced over time, ensuring across-the-board pollution reductions.\TRYING TO 'GET IT RIGHT'\RGGI is similar to a cap-and-trade system in Europe, with an American twist. The Europeans gave allowances away, while RGGI auctions them off to the highest bidders.\Ted Koffman, former House chairman of the Legislature's Natural Resources Committee, remembers how a visit from members of Britain's Parliament helped convince state officials in the Northeast to try something new.\""They felt they had failed because they gave away the allowances. It didn't create a market,"" said Koffman, who is now executive director of Maine Audubon. ""We felt if we got it right, we could help the nation get it right.""\Giving away allowances reduces the initial cost to the companies and to electric ratepayers but opens the door to unpredictable prices in the private trading market for allowances.\Auctioning off allowances sets a stable, and public, clearing price, while contributing to an increase in electricity costs. However, the Northeastern states decided to use the revenue generated by the auctions to pay for energy efficiency improvements, ranging from small residential projects to large industrial ones. That, according to economists, would eventually reduce the need for new power generating capacity and, as result, reduce electricity rates.\""The notion that you would auction off the allowances was a completely alien philosophy until RGGI,"" Tietenberg said.\In Maine, RGGI is expected to increase electricity costs about 1.5 percent over 10 years.\RGGI has so far held five electronic auctions of carbon allowances, with power plants and other investors paying a total of $432.7 million to the states.\Who buys the allowances, and how many they buy, is confidential under the rules set up by the states. Because the recession has led to such big price drops for oil and natural gas, any impact on electricity prices so far is unknown.\""The auctions have worked well,"" said Bill Cohen, a spokesman for Verso Paper, which has to buy allowances because it generates and sells power at mills in Bucksport and Jay. Cohen would not discuss how much the company has spent on the allowances, but said the program has not created any hardships.\""We didn't anticipate a whole lot of problems,"" he said. ""We had already made significant reductions in our CO2 output.""\Of the $13.5 million raised through the auctions of Maine's allowances, only $650,000 has been spent. It was allocated on an emergency basis last fall, when heating oil prices were approaching $5 a gallon, to weatherize the homes of low-income Mainers.\The Maine State Housing Authority used the bulk of that money $500,000 to weatherize about 120 homes. The Passamaquoddy Tribe and Community Concepts Inc., a South Paris-based agency, shared the remainder.\Other RGGI funds are dedicated to a combination of energy efficiency programs, from incentives to promote compact fluorescent bulbs and energy-efficient home appliances to large industrial projects valued between $100,000 and $1 million.\""It means now we have put programs in place that are helping our citizens and our consumers use energy more efficiently,"" said Michael Stoddard, deputy director of Environment Northeast, a Portland-based advocacy group. ""And that's going to serve us well when a new federal cap-and-trade system is implemented.""\The RGGI experiment hasn't been perfect, however.\WHAT THE CRITICS SAY\The cap on the number of allowances was intentionally set high to start out so that it wouldn't immediately restrict emissions and raise the cost of allowances. Then the recession pushed energy production and emissions down farther.\Regulated emissions in the region are now believed to be about 20 percent below the overall cap. In Maine, the gap appears to be even bigger. Maine has about 6 million allowances to sell each year, but the six power plants that are covered by that cap only produced 3.6 million tons of carbon emissions last year, in part because of mild weather, according to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.\That surplus of allowances is one reason that auction prices have declined since a year ago, from $3.51 per ton in a March auction to $2.19 in the latest auction last month. Uncertainty about a future national cap-and-trade program, and how RGGI allowances will fit in, also is keeping prices down, experts say.\Another criticism of RGGI has to do with the spending side.\Anthony Buxton, a Portland lawyer who represents paper mills and other large industrial electricity customers, said it is industry that faces the largest costs if auction revenue isn't used to reduce electricity use and prices. And, he said, the first use of money winterizing homes was a poor precedent.\""We were concerned that it would not be a program focused on cutting carbon but instead become a welfare program, and that in fact happened,"" Buxton said. ""We regard it as unconscionable that no money has gone out into some very valuable carbon-saving projects (in large industrial plants). If you're going to do something about climate change, you've got to take the best projects first.""\Officials with the Energy and Carbon Savings Trust, which oversees the auction proceeds, say it took time to create the new program, but that the money is coming. Last week, in fact, state officials announced a new $9 million grant program for large-scale energy-efficiency and renewable energy projects that will be paid for with auction proceeds and federal economic stimulus funds.\SHAPING THE DEBATE\Given its strengths and weaknesses, it's not clear exactly how much of the RGGI concepts will end up in the national plan.\The congressional proposal does include auctions and the use of proceeds to promote energy efficiency, hallmarks of the RGGI program. However, most allowances would be given away in the beginning to reduce the immediate costs.\While officials in Maine and the other RGGI states want more use of auctions, they only dealt with one industry and a region that isn't reliant on the coal or oil industries. The federal plan would be much broader, going beyond power plants to include virtually all sources of emissions nationwide. Even motorists would effectively be covered because fuel importers would need to hold allowances.\The federal cap also would decline more aggressively and cover other heat trapping gases, such as methane, in addition to carbon dioxide.\Still, there is little doubt that Maine and the other RGGI states are shaping the debate.\""It's the only functioning compliance program in the United States right now,"" said Kathy Lee, a Maine-based global carbon markets consultant. ""You go to a carbon meeting internationally and everyone knows RGGI. ... People continue to look at it as a model. Not that it's perfect, but it's working.""\Staff Writer John Richardson can be contacted at 791-6324 or at:\jrichardson@pressherald.com\[Sidebar]\RGGI: LEADING THE WAY ON CAP-AND-TRADE\THE REGIONAL Greenhouse Gas InitiativeI requires large power-generating plants in 10 Northeastern states to buy one allowance for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the atmosphere, starting in 2009.\ALLOWANCES CAN be purchased at auctions directly from the states or from each other in the private market.\THE OVERALL NUMBER of allowances will be capped for six years and then gradually reduced by 10 percent by the end of 2018, making it increasingly expensive to pollute and forcing the dirtiest plants to improve or shut down.

57,"The 111th Congress and the incoming Obama administration together are preparing to meet significant challenges at home and overseas - and topping the list is putting our faltering economy back on the path of growth. \While there will be a temptation to push all other priorities aside, I would caution our elected leaders not to ignore what I believe is one of the most pressing long-term issues facing our economy and our environment: how we continue to secure the energy we will need for the next 100 years without further damaging planet Earth.\Voters of both major parties want affordable, reliable energy that does not pollute the air. Energy issues garnered significant applause when both candidates spoke to their party conventions about the issue. Americans clearly care about energy costs. They care about avoiding the continued emission of carbon into our atmosphere, and they care about achieving energy independence for our country. As well they should.\These are complicated issues, with significant disagreement about the right path forward. Clearly, President-elect Barack Obama will want to declare early victories on energy and climate change issues. How, then, should we go about doing that? I offer a few areas for our new president and Congress to consider:\Yen Focus On Creating Clean-Energy Jobs. Decision-makers cannot ignore the high costs of new energy sources, especially as taxpayers are already paying for the bailout of several Wall Street firms, automakers and other major employers. Yet new energy investments produce economic benefits as well. Consider the impact of construction of proposed new nuclear reactors - as many as 3,000 to 4,000 jobs at peak periods of construction for each new reactor, according to a new report by the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition, a group I chair along with Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore.\Fortunately, some 17 companies and consortia are now considering more than 30 new reactors. Once built, each new reactor will provide 300 to 700 permanent jobs, in addition to valuable tax revenue to communities. Green jobs will also be created with investments in alternative fuels, renewable resources and the research needed to take us to the next level of clean energy.\Yen Enact Cap-and-Trade Legislation. It will always be hard for alternative-energy technologies to compete with carbon-based energy sources on cost. Alternatives are not as well-developed and therefore less efficient, and what's more, carbon-based energy producers don't pay for the costs of pollutants entering our atmosphere - costs that we all must bear as a result. A cap-and-trade system for pricing carbon and other greenhouse gases would eliminate this free pass. \When I was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, I saw firsthand what the Clean Air Act amendments accomplished. That law, enacted to combat acid rain, created a trading program based on government-set standards for safe concentrations of sulfur dioxide. The results were startling. Levels of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere fell below what the regulation had required, and we experienced nearly universal compliance across all emitters. Even more significant, this was done with less cost than anticipated and faster than required by the regulation.\Yen Support Measurable Progress on Climate Policy. In 2002, the EPA created Climate Leaders, a voluntary partnership with industry to help companies identify their emissions, create long-term plans for reducing them and then annually report their progress. The participants in the program today represent a wide range of industries from all 50 states. They include both small and large employers, and their numbers continue to grow as more companies recognize climate change as a significant issue. There are lessons to be learned from these partnerships and other efforts currently being undertaken by business that may well defuse the criticism that long-term emissions controls are always bad for business.\Yen Don't Tie Your Own Hands. We are still learning about potential new energy sources, and numerous political leaders have adopted new positions on energy and climate change issues as more evidence has become available. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) recently revisited his opposition to nuclear energy after considering the environmental benefits that the industry makes possible. The unintended impact of corn-based ethanol on the food supply both here, and worldwide, has caused many to rethink their position on that issue.\Government is at its best when it identifies priorities and areas for support but not a particular technology. For example, Congress should consider a mechanism such as a clean-energy bank to help finance any carbon-free energy source.\Yen Focus On Creating Energy Options, Not Removing Them. In time, our nation will have to make hard decisions about our current reliance on power from domestically produced coal. But for now, let's focus much more on keeping all sources of energy in the mix, especially when one of our chief energy policy goals is less dependence on foreign oil. It will require a broad, bipartisan and all-region approach to energy policy to achieve that goal. \Obviously, I believe that nuclear energy will play an important role in the energy and climate policy discussions over the next few years. Voters indeed want new sources of economical, reliable, emission-free electricity produced in America by Americans. I hope that Obama and the Congress keep an open mind on the permanent and secure storage of nuclear byproducts so that this source of clean energy can continue to play its current role in our energy mix. \But nuclear is only part of the solution to achieving a sustainable energy future. America must use all its resources - conservation, efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear energy and clean coal, as well as gas and oil if we are going to solve this problem and meet the projected increase in electricity demand of 25 percent by 2030. Indeed, Obama will need to forge a bipartisan approach toward achieving this goal. The voters expect this kind of effort - and in two or four years, our nation's newest policymakers must show that, at the outset, they assessed the challenge, defined a new direction and delivered on their commitment to the American people. \Christine Todd Whitman formerly served as Environmental Protection Agency administrator and governor of New Jersey. She is now co-chairwoman of the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition and president of the Whitman Strategy Group."
58," Washington --- President Bush outlined a collection of energy efficiency measures Thursday that he said will deal with global warming and result in a lower rate of increase of ""greenhouse gases"" that are released.\ Under the Kyoto Protocol, which was negotiated by more than 100 nations in Japan in 1997, the United States would be required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 7 percent below 1990 levels.\ The Kyoto treaty, negotiated by the Clinton administration, was never ratified by the Senate. After taking office last year, Bush rejected the agreement.\ Under Bush's plan, the United States would increase its greenhouse gas emissions by about 14 percent during the next decade --- roughly the same amount that emissions increased during the past decade.\ Bush said his plan called for a reduction of ""greenhouse gas intensity,"" or the quantity of carbon dioxide, methane and other atmosphere-warming gases.\ If the president's targets are met, for each dollar in economic growth the country achieves during the next decade, the amount of greenhouse gas going into the air will go up by 72 percent as much as it would if there were no efficiency improvements.\ The heart of the plan is to encourage companies to voluntarily slow the growth in their greenhouse gas emissions by giving them ""credits"" that could be cashed in at some time in the future if the government decided to impose mandatory reductions.\ Bush's other proposal Thursday, a ""cap-and-trade"" plan for controlling air pollution by power plants, has been promoted by the industry since before Bush took office in January 2001. Utilities want such a system to replace a provision of the Clean Air Act known as ""new-source review.""\ The Clean Air Act exempted hundreds of older power plants and other industries from the tightest controls on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. However, the new source review provision states that if significant modifications are made to those older facilities, they become subject to the reduction requirements.\ In lawsuits filed during the Clinton administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and representatives of several Northeastern states accused power companies of disguising modernization as routine maintenance to evade the rules.\ The companies have chafed under the lawsuits, and a White House energy task force chaired by Vice President Dick Cheney recommended last year that the policy be reviewed. The administration did not disclose its plans for the new-source review provision Thursday. An announcement is expected next week.\ A senior administration official who described the cap-and-trade plan to reporters said the electric power industry would be put on notice that by 2018, national emissions of three pollutants --- nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and mercury --- must be below specified limits.\ The White House said the plan will reduce sulfur dioxide emissions to about 3 million tons a year by 2018, from about 11 million tons this year. Nitrogen oxide emissions would go from 5 million tons this year to 1.7 million tons in 2018; mercury pollution would drop from 48 tons to 15 tons.\ Information from Scripps-Howard News Service was used in this article.\ Credit: COX WASHINGTON BUREAU"
59,"As a candidate for president in April 2008, Barack Obama told Fox News that ""a cap-and-trade system is a smarter way of controlling pollution"" than ""top-down"" regulation. He was right. With cap and trade the market decides where and how to cut emissions. With top-down regulation, as Mr. Obama explained, regulators dictate ""every single rule that a company has to abide by, which creates a lot of bureaucracy and red tape and often-times is less efficient.""\It's no wonder that the House advertises its American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (also known as the Waxman-Markey bill) as ""cap and trade."" And last Thursday a coalition of environmental groups and unions launched a ""Made in America Jobs Tour"" to sell it as a ticket to ""long-term economic prosperity."" But the House bill would, if passed by the Senate this autumn, fail the environment and fail the test of economic efficiency.\Waxman-Markey is largely top-down regulation dressed in cap-and-trade clothing. It purports to set a cap on greenhouse gases, but the cap is so loose in the early years that through the use of cheap offsets the U.S. need not significantly reduce its fossil-fuel emissions until about 2025. Then the bill would require a nosedive in fossil-fuel emissions. This balloon mortgage pledge of big cuts later is unlikely to be kept.\The top-down directives come in three forms. First, electric utilities, auto makers and states get free allowances on the condition that they comply with regulations requiring coal sequestration, alternative energy sources, energy conservation, advanced auto technology and more. Second, many other provisions of the 1,428 page bill mandate outright regulation on subjects ranging from how electricity is generated to off-road vehicles and household lighting. Third, still other provisions provide subsidies for government-chosen technology ""winners"" such as alternate energy sources, plug-in vehicles and weatherization of old buildings.\Progress on most or all such fronts will be needed, but when, where and how should be decided principally by a cap-driven market, not the ""red tape"" that candidate Obama deplored.\This government dictation of technology would undermine President Obama's March 19 pledge that, by addressing climate change, we would become ""the world's leading exporter of renewable energy."" That requires coming up with better, lower-cost technologies than the rest of the world. This won't happen if the government picks the technologies. Recall that, in the 1980s, government established the Synfuels Corporation that spent billions to produce energy alternatives and came up with nothing. More recently, government required refiners to put corn-based ethanol into gasoline on the theory that it's good for the environment. Yet we've learned that wide-scale ethanol production can do more harm than good in regard to air quality and climate change, turn wildlife habitat into corn fields, and raise food prices.\By contrast, the cap-and-trade legislation that Congress applied to acid rain in 1990 produced big dividends for the environment and the economy. It cut the acid-rain causing emissions from power plants by 43% and saved electricity consumers billions of dollars compared to top-down regulation.\A cap and trade can be used to tackle carbon emissions more efficiently than top-down micromanagement of technology. Indeed, cap and trade should be used to regulate major conventional pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. It is not only the smarter way to regulate such pollutants, as Mr. Obama recognized, but it is also necessary because key greenhouse gases and many conventional pollutants come from the same fuel-burning processes. Systems for regulating both kinds of pollutants should work together rather than at cross purposes, as detailed in our recent report for the American Enterprise Institute: ""Breaking the Logjam: Environmental Reform for the New Congress and Administration.""\Why has the House turned its back on the cap-and-trade approach? Both parties have played to their bases so that the only way for the Democrats to pass Waxman-Markey was to buy swing votes by picking among technologies such as coal sequestration to please critical constituencies.\While the House represents constituencies, the president must keep the focus on the broad national interest. Candidate Obama's comments on cap and trade came when asked to back up his claim that he would be a ""uniter"" by naming ""a hot-button issue where you would be willing to buck the Democratic Party line and say, 'You know what? Republicans have a better idea here?'"" President Obama needs to lead on the principles on which he campaigned and the Republicans in the Senate need to listen. Otherwise, Congress will pass something like the House bill or, worse still, won't legislate at all.\In that case, the Environmental Protection Agency would regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. This would involve even more top-down control than Waxman-Markey. Regulators would be required, for example, to impose source-specific emission limits on every major new or modified source. Government would decide who cuts emissions through a complicated process that would undoubtedly produce the very red tape and inefficiency Mr. Obama warned about. Congress should instead apply to climate change the market-based solution that it successfully applied to acid rain nearly 20 years ago.\---\Mr. Schoenbrod teaches law at New York Law School, is a visiting scholar at American Enterprise Institute, and was a staff attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

On a cap-and-trade plan.

Tim Pawlenty (http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/personalities/tim-pawlenty/) on Wednesday, June 24th, 2009 in a letter to the Minnesota delegation in Washington
\

\
THE RULING: FULL FLOP
\
He hasn't made it official yet, but it seems everything Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty does these days points to a White House run in 2012.
\
Case in point: his stance on a cap-and-trade plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Back in 2007, Pawlenty was positioning himself as an environmental leader, pushing for aggressive reductions in greenhouse gases and a regional cap-and-trade plan.
\
Fast-forward to 2009, and he's writing letters to Washington calling a Democratic plan to curb climate change, ""overly bureaucratic, misguided"" and ""very burdensome on our economy.""
\
""His position has evolved very dramatically from someone our group, quite frankly, viewed as a champion"" for the climate, said Steven Morse, executive director of the Minnesota Environmental Partnership, which is a coalition of more than 80 Minnesota environmental organizations.
\
To track Pawlenty's evolution from treehugger to cap-and-trade skeptic, we need to turn the clock back to 2007. At the time, the Minnesota Legislature was debating the Next Generation Energy Act of 2007, which outlined the state's goals for greenhouse gas reductions. The bill required the state to reduce its emissions 15 percent by 2015 and 80 percent in 2050. It also endorsed the Minnesota Climate Change Advisory Group, a panel charged with drafting a comprehensive greenhouse gas emission reduction plan to meet those goals.
\
On May 25, 2007, the day Pawlenty signed the bill, he said the state should have taken action 30 years ago.
\
""The nation has been asleep at the switch, but here in Minnesota we are kick-starting the future by increasing our nation-leading per capita renewable fuel use, boosting cost-saving measures and tackling greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said.
\
Morse said the bill was a major victory for the state, in no small part because it was a bipartisan effort; indeed, Pawlenty had actively pushed for the legislation.
\
Pawlenty grew his reputation as an environmental pioneer when he played a leading role in persuading members of the Midwest Governors Association to sign the Midwestern Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord, an agreement that the states would develop a cap-and-trade mechanism to achieve greenhouse gas reductions in the area.
\
The list of Pawlenty's climate change achievements goes on, including the Minnesota Climate Change Advisory Group, a group he formed to study the impact of climate change and make recommendations for the state, but you get the picture.
\
So, it was surprising to Morse and other Minnesota environmentalists when Pawlenty wrote a letter to the Minnesota delegation in Washington expressing his opposition to a bill authored by Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey that would set up a national cap-and-trade program to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 -- only slightly more ambitious than Pawlenty's climate change goals for Minnesota.
\
""This legislation would place significant burdens on individuals and job creators, while doing little to impact its intended goal of changing climate change,"" he wrote on June 24. He described the cap-and-trade provisions in the bill as ""overly bureaucratic, misguided"" and ""very burdensome on our economy.""
\
""I oppose any cap-and-trade system that does not set emissions caps at pragmatic levels or fails to provide free allowances to producers instead of creating an expensive auction that would bid up prices and in turn dramatically increase energy costs,"" Pawlenty ended the letter.
\
Generally speaking, Minnesota environmentalists say Pawlenty has recently been less aggressive on other climate issues, such as implementing the recommendations of the Minnesota Climate Change Advisory Group.
\
""He's silent where he used to be a leader,"" said Samantha Chadwick, an environmental associate for Environment Minnesota.
\
Pawlenty has even used the issue to poke fun at the Obama administration.
\
""Apparently, they're announcing that President Obama is making great progress on climate change,"" he said in a July speech to the Republican National Committee. ""He's turning the political climate of the country back to Republicans.""
\
Steven Schier, a political science professor at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., says Pawlenty's conservative tone is a signal of his impending run for president.
\
""Republicans in Minnesota tend to be an ideologically conservative bunch,"" he said. ""If anything, Pawlenty is a bit to the left of his party. His rhetoric has been more conservative in the last few months than it's been most of his career as governor of Minnesota. ... He's repositioned himself.""
\
No matter what Pawlenty's motivations, ""I would call it pretty much a 180-degree evolution,"" said Morse.
\
We couldn't have said it better. Pawlenty has clearly changed his tune on cap-and-trade. We give him a Full Flop.

61,"As part of a weekly series on the 45th congressional race, The Desert Sun will look at where Republican U.S.\Rep. Mary Bono Mack and her Democratic challenger, Palm Springs Mayor Steve Pougnet, stand on key issues.\This week looks at environmental issues.\THE ISSUE: The Coachella Valley is rich in renewable resources, including wind, solar and geothermal energy production. The economic blueprint local leaders unveiled last year identified clean energy and related technology as one of four areas key to creating jobs and improving the economy.\REP. MARY BONO MACK\Has praised the fast-tracking of local solar-energy projects and similar efforts that promote ""our nation's energy security and independence."" Says the region is ""playing a pivotal part in advancing clean energy technologies.""\STEVE POUGNET\Calls renewable energy ""a key driver for economic growth"" that also makes the U.S. less ""dependent on foreign countries for our energy needs."" Helped the valley secure one of six innovation hubs statewide to invest in the green economy.\THE ISSUE: The sweeping climate change bill known as ""cap and trade"" aimed to reduce greenhouse gases, limit emissions, and require utilities to rely on renewable sources. It passed the House in 2009 but stalled in the Senate.\REP. MARY BONO MACK\Bucked party conservatives as one of eight House Republicans to support the bill. Called it an ""extremely difficult vote to take"" but said ""it's time our nation become energy independent and embrace future clean energy sources.""\STEVE POUGNET\Urged BonoMack to support the bill to ""create good paying renewable energy jobs here in our region.""\THE ISSUE: Nuclear power provides about 20 percent of the country's electricity, but its role in the nation's renewable portfolio is highly debated. U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu says it is a ""critical part"" of building a clean energy economy.\REP. MARY BONO MACK\Says nuclear power crucial to a new energy policy. Indicated the final cap-and-trade legislation needs to include nuclear power for her to support the bill again.\STEVE POUGNET\Supports nuclear power as part of expanding clean energy portfolio.\THE ISSUE: State leaders in 2007 unveiled a nearly $9 billion, 75-year plan to restore the dying Salton Sea. It would use large dams to divide the sea into a recreation lake and marshy marine habitat. Advocates have said the steep price tag will require a combination of federal, state and local funding.\REP. MARY BONO MACK\Chairs the Congressional Salton Sea Task Force and helped secure $30 million for pilot projects at the sea. Says it's ""imperative that concrete actions are taken to save this sea in order to avoid the potentially disastrous consequences.""\STEVE POUGNET\Pushed for federal stimulus funds for the Salton Sea efforts During a 2009 visit with leaders in Washington. Eyed an export fee on that area's geothermal production as a way to fill the valley's coffers.\THE ISSUE: California leaders in 2006 approved Assembly Bill 32, landmark legislation requiring the state's greenhouse gas emissions to be cut to 1990 levels by 2020. Voters this November will vote on Proposition 23, which would suspend the bill until unemployment drops to 5.5 percent for a year.\REP. MARY BONO MACK\Voiced opposition to Assembly Bill 32, saying such environmental legislation should be handled by Congress and not individual states.\STEVE POUGNET\Supports California's landmark legislation, saying ""you can go green without going in the red."""
62,"Governor Corzine told a Senate committee considering climate change legislation that moving to cleaner energy will create jobs in nearly every sector of the economy.\Critics of the proposal to cap emissions of carbon dioxide and create a marketplace to trade credits say many of the ""green jobs"" touted by proponents are government subsidized and ignore jobs being lost in more traditional industries.\""We're in the midst of a real revolution right before our very eyes,"" Corzine told the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. ""It's happening, its positive, it's creating jobs. The transformation will produce tens of thousands of jobs.""\Testimony he submitted to the committee cited investment bankers helping to fund innovations in solar energy, construction firms modernizing ""our aging energy infrastructure"" and scientists at Rutgers University developing ways ""to convert algae into a renewable energy fuel.""\Corzine told the committee New Jersey laws have set the stage for the revolution, by putting the state in a regional pool that trades credits for emitting carbon dioxide and by requiring power companies to develop 30 percent of the state's electricity from renewable sources such as offshore wind farms and solar arrays.\Building wind farms will create jobs for electrical engineers, steel workers and longshoremen, Corzine said. And the state Labor Department has launched a Green Jobs Partnership Training Program to train 300 entry-level workers over the coming year on how to make homes and businesses more energy efficient. Public Service Electric and Gas has committed to hiring 100 of the graduates, Corzine said.\On the same panel as Corzine, North Dakota Gov. John Hoeven criticized the ""cap and trade"" strategy in a bill to combat global warming that passed the House and is now before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Hoeven, a Republican, pointed out that technology to reduce emissions from electric power plants fueled by coal, which the United States has in abundance, are still in the developmental stage.\Republicans on the committee agreed with him, and said ""cap and trade"" would eliminate many jobs through new mandates and regulations.\""You pass this bill, you're going to get an unemployment program with it because it's going to lose jobs,"" said Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla. He said states along the Atlantic and Pacific coastlines were advocating programs that would disproportionately harm states in the center of the country.\Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., said ""green jobs"" are also heavily subsidized.\""Wind and solar jobs are not so much created as bought,"" he said.\Kevin Roberts, spokesman for the New Jersey Republican Party, questioned why Corzine would be asked to testify about job creation when the state ""is losing clean jobs at the fastest rate in the nation.""\""Perhaps Governor Corzine has called in yet another favor from his Washington friends in an attempt to raise his profile and distract voters from his record as governor,"" Roberts said.\***\E-mail: jackson@northjersey.com\***"
63,"Conservation and stewardship. Aren't they core Republican values?\It is hard to imagine how someone can be considered a conservative if they don't want to be conservative with the most important thing we have -- our environment. Some even perpetuate the myth that conservation and environmental protection are liberal causes to justify their opposition.\Past Republican leaders have been strong advocates for the environment and were responsible for enacting some of our most significant environmental legislation. Theodore Roosevelt was responsible for greatly expanding our national parks system. Richard Nixon enacted many of the nation's landmark environmental laws, including creation of the EPA. Gerald Ford adopted the motor vehicle fuel-efficiency standards, the creation of 18 national parks and designation of 3.4 million acres of wilderness areas.\Ronald Reagan preserved a total of 10.6 million acres of wilderness. He signed the Montreal Protocol, which dramatically reduced depletion of the upper-atmosphere's protective ozone layer. He developed a cap-and-trade system that prevented acid rain from blowing into Canada.\John McCain, during his 2008 presidential campaign, proposed a pragmatic national energy policy based upon good stewardship, good science and reasonableness. He co-sponsored cap-and-trade bills in the Senate in 2003, 2005 and 2007.Cap-and-trade once was considered the market solution to reducing carbon emissions.\But now, Republican leaders are claiming cap-and-trade would cost too much; but the Congressional Budget Office estimates the cost would average $175 per household and that associated savings would reduce the federal deficit by about $19 billion by 2020. The misinformation, the damage to the environment and the additional expense that would be caused by not acting should alarm traditional Republicans. However, according to the Republicans for Environmental Protection, ""the GOP establishment has lost sight of its core conservative values, largely due to the influence of corporate lobbies and political leaders beholden to them for campaign support.""\Do Republicans need to reclaim their environmental leadership role?\Kim Everett\Mishicot"
64,"Yes: Tough caps would likely curb pollution and cool warming\By William Buzbee and Victor B. Flatt\Congress is beginning to grapple with climate change. Reps. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) have introduced a bill that would establish a cap-and-trade mechanism for significant reductions in U.S. global warming emissions. The bill is smart and comprehensive, covering energy, fuels, cars and more. Despite some shortcomings, it's a good place to start the discussion about how to fix the most serious environmental problem the planet has ever faced.\Polluting industries have mounted a scare campaign to persuade us that it's too severe, will cost jobs, choke the economy --- the same complaints we hear every time industry worries about being inconvenienced. But the truth is that in important ways, the bill doesn't go far enough.\The core of the bill is a cap-and-trade system, under which big polluters will acquire allowances that would permit them to emit greenhouse gases --- carbon dioxide, for example. If polluters emit less than anticipated, they can sell excess ""credits"" to other polluters, who can use them to effectively raise their own caps. The question is where the caps are set, and the bill ultimately sets the cap considerably above the levels recommended by scientists and international negotiators. The effort will be for naught if developing countries such as China balk at emissions targets because they believe the United States isn't shouldering its fair share.\The bill also embraces the sorts of offsets we've already seen in the markets, where a product's associated greenhouse gases are ""offset"" by carbon absorption from say, planting trees. Polluters could buy carbon offsets --- from wind farms, for example --- and use the saved emissions as a credit against their own emissions. The bill also discounts offset-created pollution rights with respect to ordinary allowances. This gives polluters sound incentives to cut their own emissions, and it adjusts offset credits to account for risks that offsets aren't as beneficial as hoped. But the bill needs to do better to ensure that environmental harms associated with offsets can be addressed.\Industry is hoping that a federal bill will have a generous cap and that it will preempt state efforts. Waxman-Markey would indeed require states to surrender their own cap-and-trade markets for five years, but otherwise preserves the possibility of state legislation. In addition, the draft bill's language needs to be strengthened to ensure states retain their usual powers to otherwise protect their citizens and the environment. Without such clarification, wasteful litigation over retained state power is likely.\One reason a cap-and-trade scheme makes sense is that it doesn't really matter where carbon emissions occur; it's the cumulative effect that matters. Unfortunately, the co-pollutants that go up the smokestack with carbon dioxide can have a severe impact on nearby communities, and those communities are usually poor. And since some polluters will accumulate credits or offsets allowing them to burn more fuel, there's good reason to worry about ""hot spots"" where co-pollutants get out of control.\April brought news that climate change has brought a major ice shelf in the Antarctic to the verge of collapse, while a six-year-long study by NASA concludes that Arctic ice is melting faster than thought. Climate change is upon us, and Waxman-Markey could be the vehicle by which the United States finally takes action.\William Buzbee, a law professor at Emory, and Victor B. Flatt, University of Houston Law Center, are scholars with the Center for Progressive Reform.\No: Caps could hinder jobs, energy sector in U.S. economy\By Donald Hertzmark\Congress is about to debate a bill that promises to remake the most fundamental resource in the U.S. economy: energy. In this, we might learn a few things:\> Energy is the largest sector of the U.S. economy, even greater than the primary energy output of the Middle East, including the Persian Gulf oil producers.\> Jobs that leave the U.S. because of cap and trade will result in more pollution worldwide than if those jobs remained here.\> The revenue base for cap and trade is only temporary, as the bill promises to kill the industries that fund the permits.\> The replacement jobs in renewable energy pay far less than do the jobs in primary energy and manufacturing that will be lost.\As California has shown, premature zeal about carbon dioxide reductions can be a big job killer. For states with a lot of heavy industry and power generation, cap-and-trade legislation, in which climate costs would be distributed across regions and income groups, is likely to force wholesale shifts in economic activity. But where will these jobs go? And will the world's environment be better or worse off?\All indications are that cap-and-trade will lead to wholesale shifts in jobs to nonparticipating countries that decline to sign a climate-change treaty. China is a nonparticipant. When industry moves to China, its carbon dioxide emissions will go up compared to the U.S. China's economy as a whole uses about twice as much energy per dollar of GDP as the U.S. manufacturing sector. This means that energy-related emissions will double or more due to this shift in activity. Moreover, since China relies on coal for almost 70 percent of its primary energy, compared to 32 percent in the United States, not only carbon dioxide, but many other emissions will more than double.\A skilled U.S. workforce will eventually find something else to make. Unfortunately, as a recent University of Massachusetts study found, the average wage in ""green energy"" jobs is about 65 percent of that in the industrial and energy jobs that are lost.\Alas, only the lawyers will do well, for cap-and-trade promises to ignite a global trade war, one already promised by Secretary of Energy Steven Chu. The cap-and-trade bill specifically permits the government to levy carbon fees on imports from non-complying countries, such as China. Such duties are contrary to world trade agreements and will lead to endless litigation and, possibly, a trade war with China, our country's largest creditor.\Europe tried cap-and-trade for its carbon dioxide program a few years back, allocating permits by firm and industry. For a few years there was a thriving market in these tradable permits, mostly to sell excess carbon dioxide permits, purchased from firms that had not used up their allowances, or to ""offset"" emissions in Europe with reductions in other countries, by investing in various clean energy projects elsewhere. When it was discovered that the initial allocation of permits had been far higher than Europe's industries actually generated, the price of permits collapsed.\Proponents in the U.S. claim that they have learned these lessons. Perhaps, but are we really serious about tacking on new costs to already struggling industries such as autos and primary metals? Or will we find a way to make special considerations for weak industries, and regions, and states? And pretty soon we will be back to the European system that reduced carbon dioxide by not one bit, but produced a whirlwind of regulations and trading activity.\Donald Hertzmark, an energy economist, consults for government and oil, gas and power businesses.\CAPTION: Donald Hertzmark, an energy economist, consults for government and oil, gas and power businesses.

65,"WASHINGTON - Both of Michigan's senators voted against a measure that would have protected a sweeping climate-change bill from being filibustered.\Although the climate-change bill isn't even out of the hands of Henry Waxman, the California Democrat who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee and wrote the bill - the Senate passed an amendment to the budget resolution Wednesday night prohibiting it from falling under the process of reconciliation. If that process had been used, it would have meant a 60-vote supermajority wouldn't be needed to cut off debate.\That 60-vote margin is what is needed to end a filibuster - the legislative tool allowed in the Senate to continue discussions in the hope of killing or significantly altering a bill.\The vote against reconciliation was 67-31, including 26 Democrats.\Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan were among them. Levin was one of more than two dozen Republican and Democratic senators who signed a letter saying the climate-change bill and its biggest component - a cap-and-trade system of auctioning off pollution emission permits for industry - was too important and far-reaching, especially in the industrial Midwest, not to undergo substantial debate.\Another possibility worth mentioning: While media attention on the climate-change legislation has largely focused on cap-and-trade, the draft legislation also includes a provision saying future fuel-economy standards would have to match California's limits on cars and trucks and would preserve that state's power to set its own vehicle emission rules.\Detroit's automakers have been fighting the California rules and say they want a single national standard.\Stabenow spokesman Brad Carroll said Thursday that the senator ""continues to work to ensure that climate change legislation is done in a way that will create jobs"" and didn't think reconciliation was the way to go.\California's two senators - Democrats Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein - voted for reconciliation.\ILLUSTRATION: Photo\CAPTION: U.S. Sens.

66,"WASHINGTON -- Insurance companies refuse to underwrite new flood policies along coastal areas of the Eastern Shore. Rising sea levels eat away at islands in the Chesapeake Bay. The federal government blocks the state from enforcing greenhouse gas emissions from new cars and trucks.\These are the challenges that concern environmental advocates in Maryland. That is why many are gratified to see climate change became an important issue in the presidential campaign leading up to Maryland's the primary vote tomorrow.\""One of the most critical questions for the candidates has been their stance on global warming,"" said Josh Tulkin, deputy director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network. That's good news, Tulkin says, for Marylanders.\""All the EPA modeling shows that the Chesapeake region, especially Maryland, is one of the most vulnerable regions to sea-level rise, severe weather and other impacts of global warming,"" he said.\""This isn't about polar bears. This is actually about an impact on people in Maryland.""\""Global warming is the exact right [issue] for them to be focused on,"" agreed Brad Heavner, the state director for Environment Maryland.\""We want in Maryland and across the country to build the clean energy economy, and it can have huge benefits from the beginning and deal with this enormous environmental problem.""\The campaigns have taken notice.\""What kind of a planet are we going to pass on to the next generation of Americans?""\Sen. John McCain asked during a debate in December. Of climate change, the Arizona Republican said, ""It's real, we've got to address it, we can do it with technology, with `cap and trade,' with capitalist and free enterprise motivation.""\The major candidates in both parties all have talked about curbing the greenhouse gases that scientists say contribute to global warming and promoting clean new energy sources.\That could mean good news for the likes of BP Solar, which is more than doubling its solar panel manufacturing plant in Frederick, and U.S. Wind Force, the Pennsylvania company that wants to lease state forest lands in Western Maryland to build electricity-generating windmills.\But Will Baker says it isn't enough. Baker, the president of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, wants to hear the candidates address environmental issues beyond climate change and alternative energy.\""Certainly our polling and other polling shows people are very concerned about clean water and clean air as basic, fundamental rights,"" he said. He spoke of how low-oxygen ""dead spots"" in the bay and a proliferation of toxic algae are threatening health, the food supply and recreational activities.\""All of these, I think, are critical not only to the Chesapeake Bay but to the planet as a whole,"" Baker said. ""While energy independence is one aspect of the environment, simply stopping pollution at its source is another.""\So far, the candidates have confined their comments largely to climate change and energy independence. McCain drew criticism from then-opponent Mitt Romney for his sponsorship of legislation that would curb greenhouse gases with ""cap and trade"" - placing a limit on emissions and requiring polluters to obtain permits that could be bought or sold.\Romney, who supported a similar program when he was governor of Massachusetts, said the McCain-sponsored bill would drive up energy costs. He agreed with McCain and another Republican candidate, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, on promoting clean new energy sources.\""Is global warming an issue for the world? Absolutely,"" Romney said in a December debate. ""Is it something we can deal with by becoming energy independent and energy secure? We sure can.\""But at the same time, we call it global warming, not America warming. So let's not put a burden on us alone and have the rest of the world skate by without having to participate in this effort. It's a global effort,"" said Romney, who withdrew from the race last week.\There is more agreement among the Democrats. Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois have detailed lengthy proposals to address climate change and energy independence with cap-and-trade programs, increased fuel efficiency and renewable energy standards, and tax breaks and investment to promote alternative energy sources.\""We will enhance our security by making it clear to the oil companies and the oil-producing countries we are not going to be dependent and be basically taken advantage of any longer,"" Clinton said during a campaign stop last month in New Hampshire. ""And we can do it to deal with global warming.""\Obama said in December that his thinking on climate change was still evolving.\""I've put forward one of the most aggressive proposals out there, but the science seems to be coming in indicating it's accelerating even more quickly with every passing day,"" Obama said. ""And by the time I take office, I think we're going to have to have a serious conversation about how drastic [are the] steps we need to take to address it.""\The League of Conservation Voters has not decided whether to endorse a candidate, but spokesman David Sandretti called the proposals from Clinton and Obama ""very good.""\""They address the overall need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and they set forward goals that accomplish those,"" Sandretti said. ""On the Republican side, clearly one candidate stands out, and that's John McCain. He has been working on this issue for a number of years, he has legislation that will reduce greenhouse gases, has a target, it's economywide. Unfortunately, his goals are not what we feel are necessary to stem the worst effects.""\Maryland is one of 15 states that were blocked by the federal EPA in December from introducing limits on greenhouse gas emissions from new cars and trucks. Clinton and Obama have signed on to legislation that would enable the states to enforce the new rules without EPA approval.\In a Republican debate last month, Huckabee, McCain and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas all said the states should be free to develop their own regulations.\None of the candidates have offered details specific to the Chesapeake Bay. Baker, of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, hoped that would change when the candidates came to the region to campaign.\""We'd like them to see the Chesapeake Bay, to see the rivers like the Potomac, the Susquehanna, the Rappahannock, the Patuxent that drain into it, and to see the kind of support cleaning up this national treasure has among the people,"" he said. ""We've found that when elected officials from Gov. [Robert] Ehrlich to Gov. [Martin] O'Malley in Maryland, Gov. [Tim] Kaine in Virginia, when they learn about the issues and sense the importance of them among the electorate, they will work to try and improve them.""\matthew.brown@baltsun.com\Credit: Sun reporter"
67,"Author: Cassandra Sweet\SAN FRANCISCO --California regulators late Thursday adopted the first large-scale cap-and-trade program in the U.S., in a move officials say will protect the environment without hurting the state's still-struggling economy.\In a 9-1 vote, the state Air Resources Board voted to adopt rules, scheduled to start in 2012, that place a limit on greenhouse-gas emissions for the state that will decline over time.\Power plants, refineries and other industrial facilities that emit carbon dioxide and can't cut their emissions by the required amount will be able to obtain pollution allowances from the state or buy them from other emitters with excess allowances.\Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said the cap-and-trade rules will help fight climate change and also boost California's clean-technology industry and overall economy.\""Billions of dollars are being poured into California in clean technology venture capital investment,"" Mr. Schwarzenegger said. ""Of course, we have to be sensitive because it's an economic downturn, and this Air Resources Board knows they have to be sensitive. But we have to reach our goals by 2020.""\Companies with facilities that emit carbon dioxide could also purchase carbon credits, or offsets, tied to emission-reduction projects, such as forests that are managed to contain carbon dioxide, to comply with required emission cuts.\Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols said there was still work to be done, including ensuring safeguards against manipulation of the market-based program and establishing a ""community benefits fund"" that would use some auction funds to help low-income families manage potential increases in energy prices.\She added that the board was mindful of proceeding with the rules without overburdening consumers, businesses or the economy. ""We are being cautious and careful within the context of a very bold effort,"" Mrs. Nichols said.\The new rules come less than a week after the world's nations reached agreement on a package of climate initiatives last week at a United Nations-sponsored summit in Cancun, Mexico. And they come six weeks after a referendum in which Californians voted to keep the state's climate law intact. A federal proposal to limit U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, however, has stalled in Congress amid political bickering.\Recent scientific studies have found that many of the earth's largest lakes have been warming more quickly than the air around them in the last 25 years, and that many glaciers around the world have been melting at an increasingly rapid pace, particularly in southern South America and Alaska.\California's Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 requires the state to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. In addition to the proposed cap-and-trade program, the state has established an aggressive renewable-energy mandate and a requirement that the carbon content of the state's vehicle fuels be cut by 10% by 2020, as part of efforts to achieve the emissions-reduction goal.\Under the proposed cap-and-trade rules, the state would give away most allowances in the first few years of the cap-and-trade program, then sell many allowances in auctions in later years. Industries that could prove the regulations were putting them at a significant competitive advantage to companies in other states could be eligible for additional free allowances. The proposed rules would establish a floor on the price of allowances sold at auction of $10 per metric ton of carbon dioxide.\Environmental groups argued for greater auctioning of pollution allowances, while heavy industry groups pressed for more allowance giveaways.\""We don't need an auction,"" said Dorothy Rothrock, a spokeswoman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. ""We think it's an extra burden on industries attempting to comply with this regulation.""\But the Sierra Club said the provision would benefit companies that were unlikely to leave the state.\Other environmental groups lauded the cap-and-trade program.\""It's a step forward that will make our country more competitive and make California a leader in the clean technology industry,"" said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York.\Greenhouse-gas emitters could purchase carbon offsets--which are expected to trade at a discount to emission allowances--to comply with 8% of their annual emission obligations.\Carbon market participants said carbon offset prices have jumped in anticipation of California's adoption of the cap-and-trade rules.\Lenny Hochschild, a carbon broker with Evolution Markets, said offset prices have doubled from about $4 a ton of carbon dioxide to $8 a ton amid much higher volumes of trade in recent weeks.\Environmental groups and residents of California's forest regions have asked the ARB to exclude companies that clear-cut forests from participating in the offset program.\The ARB has said it will consider allowing carbon credits from a range of other types of projects, from forest protection projects in Mexico and other countries, to projects aimed at destroying ozone-depleting substances.\Some carbon market participants say the agency should act quickly to approve more types of projects to avoid a lack of supply of such credits to meet demand.\Write to Cassandra Sweet at cassandra.sweet@dowjones.com\Credit: By Cassandra Sweet"
68,"So declares Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe, taking a few minutes away from a Thanksgiving retreat with his family. ""Ninety-five percent of the nails were in the coffin prior to this week. Now they are all in.""\If any politician might be qualified to offer last rites, it would be Mr. Inhofe. The top Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee has spent the past decade in the thick of Washington's climate fight. He's seen the back of three cap-and-trade bills, rode herd on an overweening Environmental Protection Agency, and steadfastly insisted that global researchers were ""cooking"" the science behind man-made global warming.\This week he's looking prescient. The more than 3,000 emails and documents from the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit (CRU) that have found their way to the Internet have blown the lid off the ""science"" of manmade global warming. CRU is a nerve center for many of those researchers who have authored the United Nations' global warming reports and fueled the political movement to regulate carbon.\Their correspondence show a claque of scientists massaging data to make it fit their theories, squelching scientists who disagreed, punishing academic journals that didn't toe the apocalyptic line, and hiding their work from public view. ""It's no use pretending that this isn't a major blow,"" glumly wrote George Monbiat, a U.K. writer who has been among the fiercest warming alarmists. The documents ""could scarcely be more damaging."" And that's from a believer.\This scandal has real implications. Mr. Inhofe notes that international and U.S. efforts to regulate carbon were already on the ropes. The growing fear of Democrats and environmentalists is that the CRU uproar will prove a tipping point, and mark a permanent end to those ambitions.\Internationally, world leaders finally acknowledged that the recession has sapped them of their political power to impose devastating new carbon-restrictions. China and India are clear they won't join the West in an economic suicide pact. Next month's summit in Copenhagen is a bust. Instead of producing legally binding agreements, it will be dogged by queries about the legitimacy of the scientists who wrote the reports that form its basis.\The next opportunity to get international agreement is in Mexico City, 2010 -- a U.S. election year. Democrats were already publicly acknowledging there will be no domestic climate legislation in 2009 and privately acknowledging their great unease at passing a huge energy tax on Americans headed for a midterm vote.\Add to that the CRU scandal, which pivots the focus to potential fraud. Republicans are launching investigations, and the pressure is building on Democrats to hold hearings, since climate scientists were funded with U.S. taxpayer dollars. Mr. Inhofe's office this week sent letters to federal agencies and outside scientists warning them not to delete their own CRU-related emails and documents, which may also be subject to Freedom of Information requests.\Polls show a public already losing belief in the theory of man-made global warming, and skeptics are now on the offense. The Competitive Enterprise Institute's Myron Ebell argues this scandal gives added cover to Blue Dogs and other Democrats who were already reluctant to buck the public's will and vote for climate legislation. And with Republicans set to pick up seats, Mr. Ebell adds, ""By 2011 there will hopefully be even fewer members who support this. We may be close to having it permanently stymied."" Continued U.S. failure to act makes an international agreement to replace Kyoto (which expires in 2012) a harder sell.\There's still the EPA, which is preparing an ""endangerment finding"" that would allow it to regulate carbon on the grounds it is a danger to public health. It is here the emails might have the most direct effect. The agency has said repeatedly that it based its finding on the U.N. science -- which is now at issue. The scandal puts new pressure on the EPA to accede to growing demands to make public the scientific basis of its actions.\Mr. Inhofe goes so far as to suggest that the agency might not now issue the finding. ""The president knows how punitive this will be; he's never wanted to do it through [the EPA] because that's all on him."" The EPA was already out on a legal limb with its finding, and Mr. Inhofe argues that if it does go ahead, the CRU disclosure guarantees court limbo. ""The way the far left used to stop us is to file lawsuits and stall and stall. We'll do the same thing.""\Still, if this Democratic Washington has demonstrated anything, it's that ideology often trumps common sense. Egged on by the left, dug in to their position, Democrats might plow ahead. They'd be better off acknowledging that the only ""consensus"" right now is that the world needs to start over on climate ""science.""\Credit: By Kimberley Strassel"
69," In his first speech as the recently confirmed head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Mike Leavitt said the Bush administration's plan for cleaning up air pollution would result in ""the most productive period of air-quality improvement in American history.""\ That was two weeks ago, and this week Mr. Leavitt proposed new regulations and standards he said would ""bring Americans the most rapid and significant air-quality improvement in a decade.""\ The rhetoric is forceful, but is it likely to be borne out in fact?\ Someone else will be president before that question can be answered, so it's not surprising that there's a sharp difference of opinion right now - particularly given the administration's controversial record in other areas of environmental protection.\ The focus this week is on reducing three forms of pollution: mercury, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide resulting mainly from power generation. Unlike his predecessor's tendency to rely on strict government regulation of such substances, George W. Bush wants to set mandatory industrywide standards, and then let the marketplace decide who takes the lead in cleaning up the air.\ It's called ""cap-and-trade,"" and it's the basis of the Bush administration's ""Clear Skies"" legislative proposal to reduce pollution. Or as President Bush told a White House gathering in September, ""Instead of government telling utilities where and how to cut pollution, we will tell them how much to cut and when we expect progress to be made.""\ Most of the attention is focused on mercury, the substance deemed most dangerous to human health.\ The Clinton vision\ The regulatory path begun by the Clinton administration would have reduced mercury emissions (now 48 tons a year) some 70 to 90 percent by 2008. This would have required coal-burning power plants (the largest human-generated source of mercury emissions) to install what the EPA calls ""maximum achievable control technologies.""\ The Bush administration plan pushes substantial mercury reductions back a decade by rolling it into less stringent EPA requirements and instituting cap-and-trade measures. One reason: It costs less for energy companies and consumers. Still, the proposal to reduce mercury emissions nationwide, as well as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide (which form smog and fine particles) in 30 eastern states, could cost the industry $5 billion or more to implement.\ Critics say cap-and-trade may be fine for less toxic pollutants. Since its inception in 1990, such a plan has helped curb acid rain, for example.\ But mercury can be far more harmful, potentially causing neurological and developmental damage to humans - especially infants. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 8 percent of American women of childbearing age have unsafe levels of mercury in their blood, putting more than 300,000 children at risk each year. Last week, a scientific advisory panel told the federal Food and Drug Administration that it needs to give clearer advice to pregnant women and young children on the risks of mercury in food - especially some tuna fish products.\ Mercury ""bioaccumulates"" in the environment, becoming more concentrated as it moves up the food chain. Forty-three states have issued warnings about eating fish with high concentrations of mercury. New research by academic scientists, announced this week, adds to the concern, showing ""severe"" impact to fish from mercury.\ ""For example, in our new research in New Hampshire we estimate that fish in 54 percent of lakes in the state violate the most stringent EPA standard for mercury,"" says Charles Driscoll, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Syracuse University in New York. ""This is a significant impact.""\ The problem with cap-and-trade, environmentalists say, is that it can create ""hot spots"" of dangerous pollutants (including mercury) near plants that have purchased ""credits"" to avoid lowering their emissions from plants that do better than federal standards - the basic way cap-and-trade works.\ Politically speaking\ The political context of the issue is as murky as the Los Angeles basin on a bad-air day. The US Supreme Court this week agreed to hear a case in which consumer and environmental groups are trying to find out whom Vice President Dick Cheney talked with in putting together the administration's energy plan.\ The groups charge that Mr. Cheney mainly listened to industry officials - campaign contributors among them - who stand to benefit from less-stringent standards. The White House says forcing Cheney to reveal details of his energy task force intrudes on the executive branch.(c) Copyright 2003. The Christian Science Monitor"
70,"HARRISBURG - Gov. Tom Wolf plans to join a coalition of states to set a mandatory, shrinking cap on the amount of carbon dioxide that can be released from Pennsylvania's fossil fuel power plants.\Mr. Wolf issued an executive order Thursday directing the state Department of Environmental Protection to draft regulations to join the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a carbon cap-and-trade program with a shared market that has netted its member states $3.2 billion since it took effect in 2009.\Owners of carbon-emitting power plants would pay hundreds of millions of dollars a year at current prices that Pennsylvania could direct toward energy efficiency, renewable energy and other projects designed to reduce the release of climate-warming gases.\The move would hasten Pennsylvania's shift away from dirtier fuels like coal and vastly expand the scope of the nation's first mandatory market-based carbon-cutting initiative.\Pennsylvania has the fifth-highest power sector carbon emissions in the country, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Power plants in the Keystone State emit more greenhouse gases than those in all of the initiative's current member states combined.\""We are in a climate crisis,"" Mr. Wolf said at a news conference, where he referred to hundreds of millions of dollars in property damage caused by record rains in Pennsylvania in 2018. ""Someone has to pay to fix the destroyed houses, roads and bridges and that's going to be all of us.""\""While setting goals and targets is absolutely important we cannot delay any longer in taking action.""\Mr. Wolf, a Democrat, had sought authorization from the Republican-controlled Legislature to start the process of joining the initiative during budget negotiations this spring but did not reach an agreement in time for the final spending deal.\Now, administration officials say Mr. Wolf has the authority under the state's existing air pollution law to join the program without the Legislature's approval, although they say the go-it-alone approach would limit the uses of the funds to state programs designed to curb air pollution.\Some Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative states have used proceeds from their carbon auctions for broader initiatives, like directly reducing consumer energy bills or making transfers to state general funds.\Mr. Wolf said he intends to work with the General Assembly and other stakeholders to help design the program and decide how to spend its revenues.\""We know that this cannot be done in a vacuum,"" he said.\Legislative pushback\Several state lawmakers are trying to block the Wolf administration's approach. Bills being drafted in the House and Senate would prohibit the governor from joining Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative or otherwise establishing a carbon price without the Legislature's approval.\House Republican leaders vowed on Thursday to use ""the fullest extent of our legislative power"" to demonstrate that the governor does not have the power to enlist Pennsylvania in a binding, multi-state agreement without the General Assembly's support.\""Our state is not an autocracy,"" they said in a statement, ""and one-sided decisions as significant as this leave out the important voices of Pennsylvania workers, communities and families whose livelihood is built upon important sectors of our energy economy.""\Senate Republican leaders named four factors that must be included in any carbon-cutting plan, including maintaining the diversity of Pennsylvania's energy portfolio - which is currently dominated by gas, coal and nuclear - and requiring that RGGI's other member states ""utilize all aspects"" of that portfolio.\They also called for keeping energy prices affordable and implementing the plan in ""an appropriate legal manner.""\The debate over a carbon price is not neatly partisan in Pennsylvania.\Some Republicans who want to preserve the state's existing fleet of nuclear plants support the idea because it would benefit electricity sources, like nuclear and solar, that don't have smokestack emissions of greenhouse gases. Some Democrats from areas that mine or burn coal oppose it out of concern that it may force power plants and mines to shut down.\Mr. Wolf may face a legal challenge either way.\A group of environmental, citizens and faith groups petitioned the state's environmental rule-making board last year to adopt an economy-wide carbon cap-and-trade program that would be much more sweeping than participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. One of the lead attorneys on the petition said Tuesday that he will sue the commonwealth if regulators reject the petition without offering a viable alternative.\How it works\The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative currently includes Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. New Jersey is rejoining the coalition in January after leaving in 2012 and Virginia may begin participating in 2021.\Each member state designs its own carbon budget and trading program - either through law or regulation - based on the coalition's model rule, but they agree to share broad goals and market infrastructure, Franz Litz, a consultant on cap-and-trade programs, told the state's climate change advisory committee on Tuesday.\Coal-, gas- and oil-fired power plants with a capacity of 25 megawatts or more must buy a credit for every ton of carbon they emit. The price for each carbon credit - or ""allowance"" - sold at the most recent auction in September was $5.20.\The regional emissions cap will shrink by about 3% a year from 2021 to 2030.\Mr. Wolf's executive order says Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative states have collectively reduced their power sector carbon emissions by over 45% since 2005.\Pennsylvania's power sector had a 28% reduction over the same time period, largely because lower-emitting natural gas plants are displacing coal plants in the competitive power market while improved energy efficiency has kept demand relatively flat.\'Modest program'\Members of the climate advisory committee questioned how much of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative states' reductions could be attributed to the cap-and-trade program.\Mr. Litz said an important feature of the program is that it ensures emissions keep declining.\""It's a fairly modest program that has managed to lock in reductions - whatever their cause,"" he said. ""It would seem to be a tool that could get a state, or a group of states, to where the electricity sector needs to be by mid-century.""\The United Nation's climate science coalition reported last year that global greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut to net zero by 2050 in order to avoid devastating increases in global temperatures.\Mr. Wolf's executive order is the beginning of a process that he estimated will take two years to complete. He directed DEP to present a draft rule to the state Environmental Quality Board by July 31, 2020.\He said the process of crafting the rule should include ""a robust public outreach effort"" to ensure that it ""results in reduced emissions, economic gains and consumer savings.""\Environmental groups praised the governor for what they called the most significant step Pennsylvania has ever taken to cut carbon pollution.\Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto said that by moving to join the initiative, Mr. Wolf ""is helping to further innovation, create green jobs and respond strongly to the challenge of climate change.""\Business and energy interests indicated they want to see how the process unfolds.\Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry CEO Gene Barr said his association supports market-based approaches to achieving environmental goals, but it also encourages legislative input in the process of developing greenhouse gas rules and an analysis of its impact on ratepayers.\A significant part of the review process will involve modeling the environmental and economic impacts of different policy paths, like what sources will be included in Pennsylvania's carbon budget.\Some states, for example, have exempted particular types of generators from their budgets. Power plants that burn waste coal piles in Pennsylvania are likely to seek such an exemption.\Regulators must also work with the existing Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative states, which will assess whether Pennsylvania's proposal is stringent enough, among other factors, before agreeing to accept a new partner.\CAPTION: \CREDIT: By Laura Legere, Harrisburg Bureau"

Cap-and-trade tax plan would damage Michigan
\
Cap-and-trade tax plan would damage Michigan
\
By Gary Wolfram
\
The proposed $650 billion ""cap and trade"" tax being pushed by the Obama administration will reduce economic growth in the United States, damage Michigan manufacturing, raise consumer costs sharply, increase our reliance on unstable sources of oil and harm free trade, all in the false hope of improving the environment.
\
The purpose of curbing carbon dioxide emissions is supposedly to prevent environmental damage from producing or using fossil fuels, which account for 85 percent of the energy used in the United States.
\
But to make any economic sense, the cap-and-trade tax in the proposed American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 would require that Congress compare the environmental cost per ton of carbon dioxide emissions to the benefit consumers get from the goods and services that are made possible from the use of oil, natural gas and coal. Then Congress would design a system where the benefit from reduced emissions was at least equal to the economic cost of reduced production.
\
No one in Congress has any idea what the cost to the environment of another ton of carbon dioxide is nor has a good idea of the lost value of production from requiring major emitters to purchase allowances. What is clear is that the allowances are being set to generate an enormous amount of tax revenue regardless of what the benefits are to the environment or the costs to the economy.
\
First, the primary argument that carbon dioxide emissions are a cost to the environment is that they contribute to global warming. That is debatable. S. Fred Singer, former director of the U.S. National Weather Satellite Service, argues persuasively in ""Unstoppable Global Warming"" that global warming is a naturally occurring phenomenon.
\
Second, it may be more cost effective to find a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than to prevent it from getting into the atmosphere in the first place. Richard Branson has offered a $25-million prize to anyone who finds a commercially viable method of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Third, the effect on the environment of reductions in U.S. emissions is likely to be overwhelmed by emissions from China, the largest and fastest growing emitter of greenhouse gases, and other emerging economies.
\
The requirement that electric utilities, oil companies and large manufacturers buy allowances to emit carbon dioxide would increase the cost of producing manufactured goods since they will have to invest in a more expensive production process or purchase carbon allowances. The increased costs will result in lower production, fewer jobs and higher prices.
\
Because Michigan relies on coal-fueled power plants for 65 percent of its electricity, our state will be particularly hard hit. Manufacturing is likely to move overseas to countries that are not beset by higher environmental costs. U.S. manufacturers will face added uncertainties since the cost of emission allowances will almost surely fluctuate. As the cost of allowances rise and fall, there will be less incentive to expand or add new manufacturing facilities.
\
The effect of the carbon tax and the administration's proposal for an additional $81 billion in taxes on the electric utilities and oil and natural gas companies would be increased reliance on energy supplies from regions of the world that are unstable or unfriendly. With increasing unemployment, financial instability and uncertain political conditions in the Middle East, this is no time to boost taxes on energy production.
\
The notion of a cap-and-trade tax on carbon dioxide emissions should be shelved until sound science has provided a reasonable estimate of the net cost of manmade emissions.

73,"As President Barack Obama capped a weeklong focus on climate change with a push for greater energy efficiency, his pitch was particularly attuned to reach two groups: big-dollar donors in the green movement and activists once inspired by his 2008 ambition to heal the planet.\Both groups will play a role in turning out Democratic voters in November -- a critical factor for the party's hope to retain control of the Senate. \But Obama has faced palpable frustration among some supporters who had hoped for more progress on his six-year-old promises. \While he notched some early accomplishments, such as increasing fuel economy standards for automobiles and placing limits on air toxins from new power plants, he abandoned his pursuit of cap-and-trade and major energy legislation because of opposition in Congress. \More recently, though, he has cheered the environmental community by again delaying a decision on the Keystone XL pipeline, which environmentalists oppose. \Next month, the administration plans to issue major new regulations that cut carbon emissions from existing power plants. \This week, the White House seized the moment to build greater credibility on climate change -- a push timed to the administration's release of a major report and a Senate debate over energy-efficiency legislation. \After the White House released the National Climate Assessment, which warned of the effects of climate change, Obama sought to highlight the issue in interviews with meteorologists, remarks at Democratic fundraisers across California and a speech Friday. \From a stage in a solar-powered Wal-Mart store in Mountain View surrounded by racks of tube socks and glitter-encrusted flip-flops, Obama announced a series of corporate pledges to increase use of renewable energy and several incremental steps to boost solar generation. \""Together, the commitments we are announcing today prove that there are cost-effective ways to tackle climate change and create jobs at the same time,"" Obama said. ""Inside of Washington, we've still got some climate deniers who shout loud, but they're wasting everybody's time on a settled debate."" \The message was a notable detour for Democrats, who have emphasized stagnant middle-class incomes and a higher minimum wage as their top-tier message in the midterm elections. \But the shift reflects a strategy to use every lever to push the party's base to the polls -- and ensure left-leaning groups have the money needed to execute that plan. \The White House said it thinks its climate push speaks to voters across the spectrum. \""For voters, any time you're taking an action that cuts pollution, it is as close as you can come to a position that has broad and deep appeal across the board,"" said one White House official, who would not be named talking about the politics of what the administration said was a policy effort. \The official said the message resonated with some of the groups Democrats are most worried may stay home -- particularly young people, who view acceptance of climate change as a threshold issue. \A number of pollsters and political scientists said, however, the approach has its limits. Many noted the voters who will be most excited by Obama's renewed focus on climate change form a sliver of the electorate. \Only 29 percent of Americans think global warming should be a top priority for the president and Congress, and it ranked second-to-last on a list of 20 issues, a Pew Research Center survey found this year. \But a Gallup poll in March found that about 70 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds said they either worried a ""fair amount"" or a ""great deal"" about climate change. \Next month, when the administration unveils regulations to cut carbon emissions from existing power plants, the renewed attention could also activate the environmental donor community, which has sought a more assertive voice in the 2014 cycle. \----------\mreston@tribune.com\Credit: By Maeve Reston and Kathleen Hennessey, Tribune Newspapers"

Editor: Is setting limits on carbon emissions necessary environmental policy? Remember air quality before Congress passed the 1970 Clean Air Act? I do.
\
Driving into the industrial Northeast along the New Jersey Turnpike in the 1960s you had to roll up the windows of your non-air-conditioned car in order not to breathe the polluted air and smell the stench that went with it.
\
After I graduated from college, I was driving around Atlanta looking for an apartment. I noticed my eyes burning and wondered what was going on, and then I realized that air pollution was causing it.
\
After I moved to North Carolina, I often traveled to the mountains to view the beautiful scenery. Today when you travel through the mountains the scenes are still beautiful, but in too many places you see the effects of acid rain. Many evergreen trees are denuded and instead of the sea of forest green, you see large areas of brown where the effects of drifting air pollutants from industries in the Ohio River Valley are clearly evident. These pollutants were carried by prevailing winds and fell to earth in rainfall on the North Carolina mountains. They caused considerable damage to our environment, until acid rain legislation was approved.
\
The improvements in our environment starting in the 1970s that resulted directly from congressional action by Democrats and Republicans on the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, and from EPA enforcement, can be continued with similar actions today. And despite those acts, the economy still continued to grow.
\
Today, climate change is the issue. The growing impact of human-induced carbon emissions is already felt in rising temperatures and rising sea levels. In order to preserve our planet, we must act to reduce these greenhouse gas emissions. The most effective way is through cap and trade, first introduced by President George H.W. Bush.
\
Cap and trade, simply put, is setting limits on emissions of pollutants into the air by industry. Those that can meet the limits get credits that they can then sell to industries that can't meet those limits. These non-attainment industries can continue to operate by buying the credits and paying for the cost of their pollution while the cleaner industries sell some of the benefits of their clean technology. The law becomes an incentive to all industries to operate in a cleaner manner, and the result is a healthier environment for all of us, a reduction in carbon emissions and a slowing of global warming.
\
This is about more than the air you and I breathe. It's about the planet that we want to leave to our children and their children. What will that planet be like? Will it be one with a continuing rise in temperatures, disappearing flora and fauna, melting glaciers and polar ice caps, and rising sea levels? Or, will we do what's right and be able to leave a planet to our children's children at least as healthy as the one we inherited?

75,"Cap and trade is the tax that dare not speak its name, and Democrats are hoping in particular that no one notices who would pay for their climate ambitions. With President Obama depending on vast new carbon revenues in his budget and Congress promising a bill by May, perhaps Americans would like to know the deeply unequal ways that climate costs would be distributed across regions and income groups.\Politicians love cap and trade because they can claim to be taxing ""polluters,"" not workers. Hardly. Once the government creates a scarce new commodity -- in this case the right to emit carbon -- and then mandates that businesses buy it, the costs would inevitably be passed on to all consumers in the form of higher prices. Stating the obvious, Peter Orszag -- now Mr. Obama's budget director -- told Congress last year that ""Those price increases are essential to the success of a cap-and-trade program.""\---\Hit hardest would be the ""95% of working families"" Mr. Obama keeps mentioning, usually omitting that his no-new-taxes pledge comes with the caveat ""unless you use energy."" Putting a price on carbon is regressive by definition because poor and middle-income households spend more of their paychecks on things like gas to drive to work, groceries or home heating.\The Congressional Budget Office -- Mr. Orszag's former roost -- estimates that the price hikes from a 15% cut in emissions would cost the average household in the bottom-income quintile about 3.3% of its after-tax income every year. That's about $680, not including the costs of reduced employment and output. The three middle quintiles would see their paychecks cut between $880 and $1,500, or 2.9% to 2.7% of income. The rich would pay 1.7%. Cap and trade is the ideal policy for every Beltway analyst who thinks the tax code is too progressive (all five of them).\But the greatest inequities are geographic and would be imposed on the parts of the U.S. that rely most on manufacturing or fossil fuels -- particularly coal, which generates most power in the Midwest, Southern and Plains states. It's no coincidence that the liberals most invested in cap and trade -- Barbara Boxer, Henry Waxman, Ed Markey -- come from California or the Northeast.\Coal provides more than half of U.S. electricity, and 25 states get more than 50% of their electricity from conventional coal-fired generation. In Ohio, it totals 86%, according to the Energy Information Administration. Ratepayers in Indiana (94%), Missouri (85%), New Mexico (80%), Pennsylvania (56%), West Virginia (98%) and Wyoming (95%) are going to get soaked.\Another way to think about it is in terms of per capita greenhouse-gas emissions. California is the No. 2 carbon emitter in the country but also has a large economy and population. So the average Californian only had a carbon footprint of about 12 tons of CO2-equivalent in 2005, according to the World Resource Institute's Climate Analysis Indicators, which integrates all government data. The situation is very different in Wyoming and North Dakota -- paging Senators Mike Enzi and Kent Conrad -- where every person was responsible for 154 and 95 tons, respectively. See the nearby chart (See accompanying illustration -- WSJ March 9, 2009) for cap and trade's biggest state winners and losers.\Democrats say they'll allow some of this ocean of new cap-and-trade revenue to trickle back down to the public. In his budget, Mr. Obama wants to recycle $525 billion through the ""making work pay"" tax credit that goes to many people who don't pay income taxes. But $400 for individuals and $800 for families still doesn't offset carbon's income raid, especially in states with higher carbon use.\All the more so because the Administration is lowballing its cap-and-trade tax estimates. Its stated goal is to reduce emissions 14% below 2005 levels by 2020, which assuming that four-fifths of emissions are covered (excluding agriculture, for instance), works out to about $13 or $14 per ton of CO2. When CBO scored a similar bill last year, it expected prices to start at $23 and rise to $44 by 2018. CBO also projected the total value of the allowances at $902 billion over the first decade, which is some $256 billion more than the Administration's estimate.\We asked the White House budget office for the assumptions behind its revenue estimates, but a spokesman said the Administration doesn't have a formal proposal and will work with Congress and ""stakeholders"" to shape one. We were also pointed to recent comments by Mr. Orszag that he was ""sure there will be enough there to finance the things that we have identified"" and maybe ""additional money"" too. In other words, Mr. Obama expects a much larger tax increase than even he is willing to admit.\Those ""stakeholders"" are going to need some very large bribes, starting with the regions that stand to lose the most. Led by Michigan's Debbie Stabenow, 15 Senate Democrats have already formed a ""gang"" demanding that ""consumers and workers in all regions of the U.S. are protected from undue hardship."" In practice, this would mean corporate welfare for carbon-heavy businesses.\And of course Congress is its own ""stakeholder."" An economy-wide tax under the cover of saving the environment is the best political moneymaker since the income tax. Obama officials are already telling the press, sotto voce, that climate revenues might fund universal health care and other new social spending. No doubt they would, and when they did Mr. Obama's cap-and-trade rebates would become even smaller.\---\Cap and trade, in other words, is a scheme to redistribute income and wealth -- but in a very curious way. It takes from the working class and gives to the affluent; takes from Miami, Ohio, and gives to Miami, Florida; and takes from an industrial America that is already struggling and gives to rich Silicon Valley and Wall Street ""green tech"" investors who know how to leverage the political class.\(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Carbon Footprints Are Tricky to Track"" -- WSJ March 13, 2009)\(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: America Needs Comprehensive Energy, Climate Laws"" -- WSJ March 17, 2009)\(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Reward Efficient Power Producers"" -- WSJ April 3, 2009)"

The Number: 50% -- Cap and trade
\
Half support the idea
\
As President Barack Obama and Congress prepare to tackle energy legislation, most Americans are not sure what a so-called ""cap-and-trade"" program is. In a Pew Research News IQ Quiz , less than a quarter (23%) of the public was able to identify cap-and-trade legislation as dealing with energy and the environment (11% said it dealt with health care, 13% banking reform and roughly half admitted they did not know). Not surprisingly, in a different Pew Research survey, just 14% said they had heard a lot about cap and trade; a majority reported hearing nothing at all. However, when such a program is described to Americans, it receives support. Half of the public favors setting limits on carbon dioxide emissions and making companies pay for their emissions, even if it may mean higher energy prices, while 39% are opposed and 11% unsure. Among those who have heard a lot about the policy, opposition to the program runs two-to-one (Republicans are more likely to have heard about cap and trade than Democrats). But political divisions are not that severe on this issue. Conservative Republicans are the only political group in which a majority opposes setting limits on carbon dioxide emissions (60%). Meanwhile, political independents as well as both moderate Republicans and Democrats roughly mirror the country as a whole in support of capping carbon dioxide. One wide divide on cap and trade is among regions of the country. While those on the Pacific coast (62%) and Northeast (56%) favor a cap-and- trade program, Americans in the South (46%), Midwest (44%) and Mountain West (42%) are far less supportive.

An occasional series on where the presidential candidates stand on some key issues
\
President Bush showed such antagonism toward the environment that the next resident of the White House can't help but be seen as an improvement. Bush scorned science, mocked climate change, shortchanged national parks and public land, undermined integrity at the Interior Department and made a joke of our most revered laws on clean air and water, and endangered species. Even former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, by admitting that human activity has contributed to global warming but stopping short of a remedy, sounds reasonable.
\
Voters deserve more, however, particularly on the greatest environmental challenge of our time - responding to the threat of climate change. So they should press the presidential candidates more closely on environmental issues and demand more detailed answers. Here is a starting point:
\
The only Republican candidate to spell out a progressive agenda on combating climate change is Sen. John McCain. In fact, he has been a leader on the subject, sponsoring serious legislation to reduce greenhouse gases. He favors a mandatory cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, a position that he came to first, and almost exclusively, among his Republican rivals.
\
Among the other Republicans only former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has spoken favorably of a mandatory cap on carbon emissions, though beyond that he has been vague or contradictory. Huckabee says he wants the nation to rely less on petroleum, then supports drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
\
Both Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney oppose any regulation linked to climate change that would be mandatory or require the United States to act on its own. Instead of focusing on the environmental consequences of our growing reliance on fossil fuels, both candidates prefer to talk about energy independence in terms of national security. Yet neither has a record of action.
\
Quite the contrary for Romney. When he had a chance to act on both state and regional plans to curb emissions while he was governor, he backed down. And Giuliani sounds suspiciously like Bush on energy choices, listing the range of options ""from nuclear power to increased energy exploration to more aggressive investment in alternative energy sources."" No mention of conservation, which could explain why Giuliani has gotten the most money of any candidate from the oil industry.
\
Democrats are traditionally stronger on environmental issues, and such is the case in the presidential primary. That doesn't mean those candidates have always been forthcoming with details, particularly on asking for individual sacrifice or addressing the cost of an aggressive response to climate change.
\
All of the Democratic candidates support a mandatory cap-and- trade system on carbon emissions. New York Sen. Hillary Clinton has acted on her positions, sponsoring various bills that would reduce greenhouse gases, invest in clean energy and improve fuel efficiency. Illinois Sen. Barack Obama signed on to some of the same legislation, and he takes the same stance as Clinton on limiting support for use of liquid coal: only if it proves to be cleaner than similar petroleum products.
\
Unlike North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, Clinton and Obama are more careful not to offend. Neither has a strong objection to an expansion of nuclear power, while Edwards opposes it.
\
Clinton has gotten more contributions from the oil industry than her Democratic rivals, although she proposes policies that wouldn't make those influential donors happy, such as paying for renewable energy research by cutting oil subsidies. Obama, from a corn- growing state, not surprisingly favors more ethanol production, even though it could be detrimental to global warming and food prices.
\
No candidate from either party has had the courage to tell voters there can be no gain without pain. Any serious response to climate change, our reliance on foreign oil or our desire for diverse energy choices will be expensive, even chaotic, in the short term. America will not be able to fight the coming climate and energy battles on the cheap or without widespread public buy-in. At least McCain and the Democratic candidates have proposed real solutions. Yet even they each would have to provide more leadership if our nation is to act before it is too late.

On June 26, U.S. Reps. Carol Shea-Porter and Paul Hodes answered President Obama's call and helped pass the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill, which greatly increases energy taxes.
\
You will love this bill if you have the following problems: You don't pay enough for gasoline, heating fuel or electricity. Your cost of living is too low. Your total taxes are not high enough. You want a bigger, more expensive government.
\
The Wall Street Journal estimates that costs for the average family of four will ramp up to $1,800 per year in 2020 and to over $6,800 per year as all aspects of this bill are implemented.
\
This bill will destroy between 1.1 million to 2.7 million American jobs every year. Increased energy costs will drive American businesses, along with their jobs, overseas.
\
Claims that this bill will help the environment are false. Similar cap-and-trade schemes in Europe have not been beneficial. Moving American jobs overseas will increase CO2 production and total pollution because U.S. industry is clean compared to many others.
\
Shea-Porter and Hodes voted for a bill to raise your cost of living, destroy millions of American jobs, and increase pollution, most likely without even reading the bill. It is time to replace them with people who care about the well-being of their fellow Americans.

\
CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch said Thursday he wants the state to remain a member of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative aimed at reducing carbon emissions.
\
Lynch announced he is opposing House legislation that would repeal that participation.
\
In a letter to The House Science, Technology and Energy Committee, Lynch said repealing the law will cost electric ratepayers up to $6 million in higher costs while forfeiting $12 million a year in funding.
\
""Withdrawing from RGGI would be a blow to our economy and to our state's efforts to become more energy efficient and energy independent,"" Lynch wrote.
\
The committee held a hearing Thursday on a bill to repeal the program started three years ago.
\
New Hampshire is one of 10 Northeastern states participating in a cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide. Under the program, generators must reduce pollution or bid at auction for allowances giving them the right to produce certain amounts of carbon dioxide.
\
Proceeds from the auction are used for energy efficiency programs. Critics complain electric users are funding efficiency programs that don't directly benefit them.
\
""Through this initiative, we have invested significantly to help increase the energy efficiency of homes, public buildings and businesses,"" said Lynch. ""In many cases, these funds help to leverage additional private resources to achieve even greater benefits.""
\
Last year, New Hampshire raided its fund to help pay for other state spending -- a move Lynch supported and defended by saying the overall goal of reducing energy demand was being met through a mix of state and federally funded programs.
\
The repeal bill's prime sponsor, Republican state Rep. Richard Barry of Merrimack, said his main concern was government's involvement. He also criticized its funding source.
\
""RGGI is a stealth tax that never shows up. It's hidden on your electric bill,"" he said.
\
State Rep. Andrew Manuse, a Derry Republican and bill co-sponsor, argued the law is hurting, not helping New Hampshire's economy.
\
""Even if carbon dioxide emissions are a problem for the environment, the regional greenhouse gas initiative has simply not impacted the overall reduction of emissions, yet it has had and will continue to have a significant negative impact on the economy,"" he said.
\
Any benefit from New Hampshire's emissions reductions is nullified by growing emissions in other countries, he said.
\
State Air Resources Director Robert Scott testified that the program was never intended to solve the climate change problem. When the program was established, the Legislature intended for it to be revisited to see if it was working, he said.
\
""It was a beginning,"" he said.
\
Environmental groups including the New Hampshire chapter of the Sierra Club and Environment New Hampshire are urging the bill's defeat as is House Democratic Leader Terie Norelli.
