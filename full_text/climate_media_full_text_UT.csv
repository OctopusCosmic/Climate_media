This fall, Congress faces a major economic and environmental decision that will affect the lives of all Americans: what to do about climate change. While some Americans question whether global warming is threatening our future, many federal legislators agree it must be addressed. How to do that is the multibillion-dollar question.
\
Congress' answer is to create a cap-and-trade market. Under this approach, the government caps the amount of carbon dioxide companies can emit. The government then auctions or gives away ""emission allowances"" -- each allowance being the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide. Experts estimate these auctions could amount to more than $100 billion annually. Companies could then trade allowances on a ""carbon market"" open to everyone, including Wall Street players.
\
As a not-for-profit public power utility, we have a huge stake in this debate. Since our mandate is to provide reliable, reasonably priced electric service, while protecting the environment, the cost of climate change legislation is immensely important to us. Unlike investor-owned utilities, we can't absorb new cap-and-trade costs by trimming profit margins or reducing shareholder dividends. Especially in tough economic times, customers don't want us passing on additional costs or sacrificing service.
\
This month, the U.S. Senate debates the American Clean Energy and Security Act (HR2454), a cap-and-trade bill that passed the U.S. House in June. The bill has shortcomings that could result in costs harmful to consumers, the economy and the reliability of our electric system, without providing any environmental benefit.
\
If Congress addresses climate change with a new multibillion-dollar market, they need to get it right.
\
The most important thing the Senate can do is place a ceiling on carbon allowance prices to ensure a cap-and-trade market does not result in runaway prices. Some want a ceiling and a floor to keep prices high enough to motivate changes in behavior without harming our economy. Since HR2454 also contains mandatory reduction targets, emission reductions will occur. But prices must be capped to avoid volatility and limit risk to electricity customers.
\
Any cap-and-trade legislation should also allocate (not auction) emission allowances at no cost to public power and other local distribution utilities so they can pass their value directly to customers. Whether allowances are auctioned or allocated, the emissions cap means greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced. Competitive auctioning allowances would just increase prices.
\
To ensure unregulated generators do not receive windfall profits at the expense of consumers, allowances should be given only to local distribution utilities that directly serve retail customers. These entities are regulated by state and local governments that will require the value of allowances be passed on to customers. Unregulated ""merchant"" generators face no such restrictions and will likely pass that value on to their shareholders. The House climate change bill would allocate up to 10 percent of emission allowances for the electricity industry to merchant generators.
\
If lawmakers want to reduce greenhouse gas, community-owned power groups are asking our leaders to pass laws that are both fair and affordable. Current legislation falls woefully short of this goal. We urge citizens join us in asking Sen. Orrin Hatch (202-224-5251) and Sen. Bob Bennett (202-224-5444) for a law that balances the needs of consumers, our economy and our environment.

The Number: 50% -- Cap and trade
\
Half support the idea
\
As President Barack Obama and Congress prepare to tackle energy legislation, most Americans are not sure what a so-called ""cap-and-trade"" program is. In a Pew Research News IQ Quiz , less than a quarter (23%) of the public was able to identify cap-and-trade legislation as dealing with energy and the environment (11% said it dealt with health care, 13% banking reform and roughly half admitted they did not know). Not surprisingly, in a different Pew Research survey, just 14% said they had heard a lot about cap and trade; a majority reported hearing nothing at all. However, when such a program is described to Americans, it receives support. Half of the public favors setting limits on carbon dioxide emissions and making companies pay for their emissions, even if it may mean higher energy prices, while 39% are opposed and 11% unsure. Among those who have heard a lot about the policy, opposition to the program runs two-to-one (Republicans are more likely to have heard about cap and trade than Democrats). But political divisions are not that severe on this issue. Conservative Republicans are the only political group in which a majority opposes setting limits on carbon dioxide emissions (60%). Meanwhile, political independents as well as both moderate Republicans and Democrats roughly mirror the country as a whole in support of capping carbon dioxide. One wide divide on cap and trade is among regions of the country. While those on the Pacific coast (62%) and Northeast (56%) favor a cap-and- trade program, Americans in the South (46%), Midwest (44%) and Mountain West (42%) are far less supportive.
"
2," Utah is joining a regional push to cut greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming through a carbon cap-and-trade program, Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. announced Tuesday.\A proposal crafted through the Western Climate Initiative aims to reduce carbon dioxide and other gas emissions by 15 percent by 2020.\But the plan for now is just a framework, ""the beginning of extensive discussions that will continue with our Legislature and stakeholders to ensure the design works for Utah,"" said Dianne Nielson, Huntsman's energy policy adviser.\Already, though, some state lawmakers worry that the initiative could hinder the state's economic growth.\""We want to protect the environment. We want to protect the air quality and do all those things . . . but we want to make sure that the coal industry and some of these that are important economic drivers for our state"" are not harmed, said House Speaker Greg Curtis, R-Sandy, who was briefed on the program Monday.\As proposed, the Western Climate Initiative, which includes seven Western states and four Canadian provinces, will use emissions from 2010 as a baseline for cap-and-trade.\Beginning in 2012, each partner will be granted emission ""allowances"" that will move the state to the WCI's goal.\It then will be up to each state or province to decide how to distribute its allowance.\Carbon ""offset"" credits from uncapped sectors or entities that reduce emissions could be auctioned.\Nielson said that Utah's approach to greenhouse gas reductions would be spelled out in a bill to be written for the 2010 Legislature.\A task force - composed of lawmakers, executive branch representatives, industry, utilities, energy producers, consumer groups, environmental advocates, local government and others - would be assembled to nail down the details the bill would include, she said.\Under the WCI framework, emissions would be rigorously monitored. If a company, utility or some other entity doesn't have enough allowances to cover its emissions, it could lose some of its allowances as a penalty, forcing it either to buy more credits or cut its emissions.\When Huntsman enlisted the state in the Western Climate Initiative in 2007, some lawmakers were irritated that they weren't consulted first. A bill aimed at limiting the governor's power to enter into such agreements in the future passed the Legislature by an overwhelming margin last session, but Huntsman vetoed it and agreed to consult with legislative leaders before he commits the state to future partnerships.\Curtis said lawmakers want to know more about the cap-and-trade plan.\""I don't feel like we've been deeply consulted,"" said Curtis, who had a planned meeting on the proposal with the governor Monday, but it was replaced with discussion of the state's $272 million budget shortfall.\WCI proponents say that, in addition to reducing emissions, the plan would ease dependence on fossil fuels and spawn new ""green"" industries.\Utah Clean Energy executive director Sarah Wright said Utah's approach likely would be conservative because the state could achieve the ""cap"" part of the plan largely through an aggressive energy efficiency program Huntsman already has in place.\""It's not a sea change in the way we generate and use energy,"" Wright said. ""We're not going to be closing down coal plants.""\Nielson said the WCI wanted a cap-and-trade plan rather than a carbon tax, which would have been more expensive.\""We want it to be an affordable system,"" she said. ""We're looking to be sure we have a diversified energy base, and that includes coal,"" she said.\Britt Weygandt, executive director of the Western Business Roundtable, a pro-industry group, said the organization is still examining the WCI plan. However, he said, a regional cap-and-trade system ""would dramatically increase costs to consumers in the West of virtually everything we buy.""\That's not how the Union of Concerned Scientists sees it. Christopher Bush, a UCS climate economist, said analyses conclude that region's economy would benefit from investments in global warming solutions.\Plan includes seven Western states, four Canadian provinces The Western Climate Initiative includes Arizona, California, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington and Canadian provinces British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec.\The group has advanced a plan to reduce global warming pollution by capping greenhouse gas emissions and allowing auctions or trades of credits allocated according to a monitored system.\Each state and province will create its own path to the overall goal of reducing emissions to 2005 levels by 2020.\In Utah, a panel of interest groups will craft necessary policy for consideration by the 2010 Legislature.\All large utilities and industries that emit more than the equivalent of 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases must by federal law submit a report on their actual emissions by 2011.\The deadline for WCI member states and provinces to implement their cap-and-trade systems is 2012.\Credit: Robert Gehrke and Patty Henetz The Salt Lake Tribune"
3,"The Western Climate Initiative's cap-and-trade system for reducing CO2 emissions among WCI members - seven Western states and four Canadian provinces - is just a baby step toward substantially cleaner air.\Gov. Jon Huntsman and the other governors know that their state legislators, Utah's perhaps most of all, are not likely to pass legislation to enact the cap-and-trade program if it threatens industries like coal mining. So they are moving slowly. Too slowly.\While the WCI goal to reduce emissions to 2005 levels by 2020 - about a 15 percent reduction - is a start, it is a weak goal that will not bring about real change. It falls far below the action urged by many climate scientists, who warn that global temperatures are rising faster than predicted and that we are facing global castastophe if we don't act fast. It must be considered only a beginning, not an ultimate end point.\The cap-and-trade system would allocate carbon-emission ""allowances"" to each member state. According to state laws still to be adopted, those allowances would go to polluters within the state. If any state or province exceeded the emissions allowed, it would have to purchase credits from another member.\Utah House Speaker Greg Curtis is already setting the stage for opposition in the Legislature. He told a Salt Lake Tribune reporter, ""We want to protect the environment. We want to protect the air quality and do all those things . . . but we want to make sure that the coal industry and some of these that are important economic drivers for our state"" are not hurt. In other words, we want to do all those things, but we don't want to change the status quo.\Unfortunately, that's not possible. Utah's economic focus has to shift from coal-fired power, the worst contributor to global warming, to alternative sources of energy. Some jobs will inevitably be lost, but other jobs will be created in the process of making the change.\Huntsman says Utah would achieve its share of emission reduction largely through an aggressive energy-efficiency program. But much more will have to be done to save the planet.\Our leaders must understand that we cannot avoid making changes in the way we live and do business if we are to avoid the worst effects of fouling our air with fossil fuels.\Credit: Tribune Editorial"
4,"Bill Barron is the last guy you'd think of as a politician. Soft-spoken and admittedly shy, the unaffiliated, unlikely candidate is trying to unseat Sen. Orrin Hatch because he's concerned about something other politicians don't talk about -- climate change. So, like Democratic challenger Scott Howell, he's spent months jabbing yard signs into supporters' lawns and handing out fliers.\""I see it as an opportunity to get the message out,"" Barron says, canvassing his own central Salt Lake City neighborhood on a brilliant fall morning, his pocket stuffed with brochures and green placards tucked under his arm. ""It's a central issue that's not being addressed.""\Many of the people he meets agree with Barron, that candidates and voters ought to be talking more about the environment, even though it's not getting much traction this campaign season.\The presidential candidates haven't mentioned wildlands, clean air or fishable water. Nor have they uttered the words ""climate change"" in three debates.\Only Friday did President Barack Obama mention climate change in an interview on MTV. After noting the impact on future generations, he pointed to his administration's emissions-cutting steps, including stepping up energy conservation, fuel-efficiency and clean-energy production.\""We are not moving as fast as we need to,"" said Obama .\Republican challenger Mitt Romney, meanwhile, has recently said that, while he believes the climate is changing, he does not think climate science is settled enough to take steps to reduce the emissions blamed for the rapid buildup of greenhouse gasses. As Massachusetts governor, Romney's administration helped develop a regional cap-and-trade program, then abandoned it over fear about cost.\Political insiders say there's nothing new to the short shrift voters give to environmental issues.\""In poll after poll,"" energy-industry lobbyist Frank Maisano told a gathering of reporters this month, ""it ranks at the bottom of [voters' priority lists] every time.""\James Browning, a regional director for the government watchdog group Common Cause in the Midwest, said industry, with its big image-making budget, has sidelined concern about the environment.\""A lot of people who are very concerned about climate change don't have very good electoral options,"" he said.\Which is where the third-party candidates come in, both nationally and in Utah.\Salt Lake City-based presidential candidate Rocky Anderson calls environmental issues a driving force behind his own presidential bid. In every appearance, he raises the problem of climate change, ""the most urgent and consequential issue on the planet."" He blames the power of money in Washington for making Democrats and Republicans alike beholden to campaign contributors in the fossil fuel industry.\""We could overcome that if there was the interest and the energy at the grass-roots level,"" he said, adding that the mainstream media ignore candidates like himself who raise the climate change issue.\As an unaffiliated candidate running in Utah's second congressional district against Republican Chris Stewart and Democrat Jay Seegmiller, Joe Andrade also regards climate change as a central issue in his campaign -- and one that voters struggle to reconcile with a healthy economy. He tries to tell them there are reasonable answers.\""It can't be dealt with just as climate change,"" he said, suggesting dealing with climate is actually a solution for creating jobs and the strengthening the economy.\For Barron, there have been disappointments, like the people who say climate change is not a problem. There was also the guy who blasted his horn during a honk-and-wave last week so he could brandish an insulting middle finger.\But many have been like Bradley Bassie and his sweetheart Cassie Craig, who promised Barron their votes after he told them about carbon-control legislation that would increase jobs and boost the economy.\""I don't know why it's not"" a big election issue, says Craig, ""and I think its egregious.""\fahys@sltrib.com\Twitter: @judyfutah\Environmental issues overlooked in race 2012\Environmental issues: A concern in Utah's state races\The Utah Chapter of the Sierra Club has a list of endorsements for Utah candidates in races for the state Legislature and some local offices: http://tinyurl.com/8e8ewdk The group also has a scorecard to help voters learn about key environmental votes in the Legislature: http://tinyurl.com/8eea9g6\The non-partisan Utah Foundation surveyed voters this year and found environmental issues were the seventh highest priority in the election year, making them a consistent top-ten issue for Utah voters.\In the group's latest ""Utah Priorities Survey,"" 53 percent of Utahns said they are concerned or very concerned with environmental issues in general.

Yet, he noted his concern that controlling pollution blamed for climate change will increase energy prices and drive jobs overseas.\""We need to be thoughtful as we move forward,"" Herbert said.\In addition, Herbert cited concerns about conserving disposal capacity for domestic radioactive waste as a key reason to oppose foreign waste.\""We have been very consistent on saying that we don't think we want to have foreign waste imported into Utah,"" he said.\The Salt Lake City-based nuclear waste company EnergySolutions Inc. won a federal court ruling last week that would allow it to use its Tooele County disposal site for low-level radioactive waste from foreign countries.

BURNT WOODS, Ore. -- Driving through the verdant timberlands of Oregon's Coast Range, Matt Fehrenbacher pointed out a mountainside where every tree had been clearcut.
\
""That's business as usual,"" said Fehrenbacher, a forester with The Pacific Forest Trust, a conservation group that manages private forests, both to produce lumber and to store carbon as a hedge against global warming.
\
Later Fehrenbacher walked through the forest he manages for the Van Eck Forest Foundation, showing off tall Douglas firs that are breaking into a new growth spurt after trees around them were cut to let in more sun, dead logs with mushrooms sprouting from them left behind on the forest floor, and hemlock seedlings planted next to stumps left from logs sold for lumber.
\
""There's a sweet spot where a landowner can potentially balance your timber value with your carbon values,"" said Fehrenbacher. ""As this market emerges, it's becoming more of a reality. Landowners' interest is very high right now.""
\
The Van Eck Oregon Forest that Fehrenbacher manages is not yet getting paid for the carbon it stores, but it is positioning itself for the day when it will be, either under an emerging voluntary market for carbon credits, or if climate legislation -- one of President Obama's top priorities -- is enacted in the U.S. Senate.
\
Trees naturally absorb carbon dioxide as part of photosynthesis, and store it in their leaves and wood. When trees burn, rot or are cut down, they return carbon to the atmosphere. The trick is to maximize the amount that gets stored.
\
While the climate bill has drawn strong opposition from conservatives wary of creating a cap and trade system that charges carbon producers, like coal-fired power plants, it has united two longtime adversaries.
\
Timberland owners and environmental groups both want to see the bill pass. For timberland owners, it means new sources of revenue immune to the boom and bust of the housing industry. One comes from the cap and trade market paying for leaving trees standing. Another comes from promoting the sale of biomass -- small trees cut to reduce fire danger and make room for other trees to grow -- that can be mixed with coal in power plants, or turned into pellets for wood-fired furnaces.
\
For conservation groups, it is a way to stop millions of acres of forest land from falling to development, leaving it standing for fish and wildlife habitat.
\
""A lot of people in the Senate want to get the whole thing through without cap and trade,"" said Andrew Light, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington, D.C. ""Some are starting to realize ... that if you don't get cap and trade, you don't get all the great forestry stuff, which is bringing together a lot of strange bedfellows.""
\
As yet, the bill does not address national forests or the desire of wood products manufacturers to get credit for lumber and plywood that will store carbon in buildings for a century or more.
\
The ""forestry stuff"" does have timberland owners very interested.
\
""We're taking it on the chin right now,"" said Dave Tenny, a former Bush administration timber official now heading the National Alliance of Forest Owners. ""Markets are down. The economics pressures are real for every class of landowner. Now, here comes an opportunity for new incentives or markets for these forests to make a contribution, not only to the environment, but to landowners as well.""
\
Landowners are already starting to reap the benefits of leaving trees standing as companies look for ways to voluntarily offset their carbon footprint.
\
Walt Disney Co. recently pledged $7 million to protect or restore tens of thousands of acres of forest in the Congo basin, the Amazon basin, California's North Coast and the lower Mississippi Valley.
\
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. is paying the city of Arcata, Calif., $400,000 to manage part of its city forest to store carbon for the next 100 years.
\
Brian C. Murray, director for economic analysis at Duke University's Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions, said carbon credits could move tens of millions of acres of cropland into forest, particularly in the Southeast and Midwest, where they have moved back and forth since the Civil War.
\
""It would be largest land movement we've ever seen in such a short period of time,"" he said.

WASHINGTON -- In the 1970s and early '80s, having seized control of the U.N. apparatus (by power of numbers), Third World countries decided to cash in. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was pulling off the greatest wealth transfer from rich to poor in history. Why not them? So in grand U.N. declarations and conferences, they began calling for a ""New International Economic Order.""
\
The NIEO's essential demand was simple: to transfer fantastic chunks of wealth from the industrialized West to the Third World.
\
On what grounds? In the name of equality -- wealth redistribution via global socialism -- with a dose of post-colonial reparations thrown in.
\
The idea of essentially taxing hard-working citizens of the democracies in order to fill the treasuries of Third World kleptocracies went nowhere, thanks mainly to Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher (and the debt crisis of the early '80s). They put a stake through the enterprise.
\
But such dreams never die. The raid on the Western treasuries is on again, but today with a new rationale to fit current ideological fashion. With socialism dead, the gigantic heist is now proposed as a sacred service of the newest religion: environmentalism.
\
One of the major goals of the Copenhagen climate summit is another NIEO shakedown: the transfer of hundreds of billions from the industrial West to the Third World to save the planet by, for example, planting green industries in the tristes tropiques.
\
Politically it's an idea of genius, engaging at once every left-wing erogenous zone: rich man's guilt, post-colonial guilt, environmental guilt. But the idea of shaking down the industrial democracies in the name of the environment thrives not just in the refined internationalist precincts of Copenhagen. It thrives on the national scale too.
\
On the day Copenhagen opened, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency claimed jurisdiction over the regulation of carbon emissions by declaring them an ""endangerment"" to human health.
\
Since we operate an overwhelmingly carbon-based economy, the EPA will be regulating practically everything. No institution that emits more than 250 tons of CO2 a year will fall outside EPA control. This means more than a million building complexes, hospitals, plants, schools, businesses and similar enterprises. (The EPA proposes regulating emissions only above 25,000 tons, but it has no such authority.) Not since the creation of the Internal Revenue Service has a federal agency been given more intrusive power over every aspect of economic life.
\
This naked assertion of vast executive power in the name of the environment is the perfect fulfillment of the prediction of Czech President (and economist) Vaclav Klaus that environmentalism is becoming the new socialism, i.e., the totemic ideal in the name of which government seizes the commanding heights of the economy and society.
\
Socialism having failed so spectacularly, the left was adrift until it struck upon a brilliant gambit: metamorphosis from red to green. The cultural elites went straight from the memorial service for socialism to the altar of the environment. The objective is the same: highly centralized power given to the best and the brightest, the new class of experts, managers and technocrats. This time, however, the alleged justification is not abolishing oppression and inequality but saving the planet.
\
Not everyone is pleased with the coming New Carbon-Free International Order. When the Obama administration signaled (in a gesture to Copenhagen) a U.S. commitment to major cuts in carbon emissions, Democratic Sen. Jim Webb wrote the president protesting that he lacks the authority to do so unilaterally. That requires congressional concurrence by legislation or treaty.
\
With the Senate blocking President Barack Obama's cap-and-trade carbon legislation, the EPA coup d'etat served as the administration's loud response to Webb: The hell we can't. With this EPA ""endangerment"" finding, we can do as we wish with carbon. Either the Senate passes cap-and-trade, or the EPA will impose even more draconian measures: all cap, no trade.
\
Forget for a moment the economic effects of severe carbon chastity. There's the matter of constitutional decency. If you want to revolutionize society -- as will drastic carbon regulation and taxation in an energy economy that is 85 percent carbon-based -- you do it through Congress reflecting popular will. Not by administrative fiat of EPA bureaucrats.
\
Congress should not just resist this executive overreaching, but trump it: Amend existing clean air laws and restore their original intent by excluding CO2 from EPA control and reserving that power for Congress and future legislation.
\
Do it now. Do it soon. Because Big Brother isn't lurking in CIA cloak. He's knocking on your door, smiling under an EPA cap.

9,"I recently attended a panel discussion organized by Sen. Orrin Hatch and Gov. Gary Herbert on the purported financial costs of a carbon cap-and-trade program. The panel consisted entirely of representatives of local energy companies, such as Rocky Mountain Power and the Utah Petroleum Association. Glaringly absent were environmental groups and those who support the bill. The program was discussed solely on the basis of the economic impact to consumers of energy in Utah.\One question brought up the indirect costs from allowing unchecked climate change -- the negative effects on health and the environment, which could significantly affect tourism. She was met by boos.\I was appalled both by the lack of civility and by the arrogance and ignorance of individuals who are only concerned with immediate profits and who refuse to see how their actions impact the future.\If we are going to have a real discussion on cap and trade, as opposed to a tutorial from the energy sector on preserving their profits, Hatch and Herbert need to invite representatives from both sides to discuss the costs and benefits of a cap-and-trade program in social, environmental and economic terms.\Kate Whitbeck\Salt Lake City\Credit: Public Forum Letter"

NEW YORK -- One would expect some diversity of opinion at a gathering of heads of government, CEOs and nonprofit organizations from different sides of the political spectrum. That was not the case at the Clinton Global Initiative meeting last week, devoted mostly to climate change. From the CEO of Duke Energy Corp. to the president of the Natural Resources Defense Council to Al Gore, everyone agreed on the need for draconian limits on carbon emissions worldwide. The proposals varied from taxes to a carbon ""cap and trade"" system, but the assumptions on which they were all basing them were the same -- and they seem somewhat premature. No one was too concerned with the costs that a blanket limit on emissions worldwide could inflict on millions of desperate people trying to pull themselves out of poverty.
\
The main assumption was that most of the warming has been caused by rising levels of carbon dioxide. But scientists have not yet reached a consensus on that. The average temperature has risen a bit less than 1 degree Celsius in the last 100 years. While greenhouse gases have risen substantially since the 1950s, half of the warming took place in the early half of the 20th century -- according to professor Phil Jones of the School of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia, in a study titled ""Global Temperature Record.""
\
The second assumption is that all CO2 is poison. Actually, about 40 percent of it is reabsorbed by plants and trees, as a paper by Stephen Pacala in the journal Science has shown. The statistics on carbon emissions usually disregard the percentage that is reabsorbed.
\
The third assumption is that the climate-change models used to predict global warming are consistent. Actually, as a recent pamphlet by the National Center for Policy Analysis demonstrates with the use of clear graphics, those predictions have varied widely in recent years.
\
Finally, everyone seemed to assume that government imposition works better than voluntary action. They kept citing the case of the European Union, where a cap and trade system establishes a general limit on carbon emissions and allows companies to exchange carbon ""rights."" However, in the last 10 years the rate of growth of carbon emissions has been much lower in the United States, where there is no federal limit, than in Europe.
\
There was even a reduction of 1.3 percent in carbon emissions in the United States last year.
\
There are those who argue that even if these assumptions turn out to have been premature, there is no harm in protecting the environment. That, of course, is a comfortable position to take if you happen to live in a prosperous nation where you can afford to make costly mistakes. But developing nations are already being hurt. According to the International Monetary Fund, the price of food worldwide went up by an average 23 percent in the last 18 months because of the rising demand linked to biofuels. It is true that biofuels will eventually create business opportunities for developing countries, too, but for that to happen, Europe and the U.S. will need to scrap their protectionist policies. Brazilian sugar cane ethanol is the obvious example. The U.S. imposes a 54 percent tariff in order to protect corn farmers in Iowa, Kansas and other states. Corn is a much less efficient source of ethanol than is sugar cane.
\
Private companies are well ahead of the politicians with regard to the environment. They are investing in new technologies, making more efficient use of energy and beginning to develop financial instruments that will provide liquidity to nascent ecological markets. For instance, Jeff Bortniker, the CEO of Equator Environmental, is creating financial assets and carbon credits linked to reforestation in Brazil that can then be traded internationally. ""The market is by far a better solution,"" he tells me, ""and we are already showing that without bureaucratic interference we can create value and at the same time protect the environment.""
\
Brazilians will appreciate it -- they have lost nearly 150,000 square kilometers of Atlantic forest since 2000, not to mention the hundreds of thousands of Amazon rain forest lost in recent decades because no one felt the need to protect land that was nobody's property.
\
Governments need to look at the science more closely before taking actions that could have damaging consequences. We also must remember that, when it comes to protecting the environment, private enterprise can be more successful than governments.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- All airlines flying to and from Europe should trade carbon emissions permits from 2012, EU states governments said.
\
The deadline is a year later than the date set by EU lawmakers.
\
EU environment ministers agreed there should be only one single starting date for the cap-and-trade program, scrapping the original idea of giving non-EU airlines an extra year to adjust to the plan that U.S. officials claim will spark a trade war.
\
But they must still strike a compromise with the European Parliament which voted in November for all carriers to launch the plan in 2011.
\
EU nations said the first year's cap should be based on average yearly emissions from 2004 to 2006, drawing complaints from airlines who say aviation will have grown by then and the tight limit would cripple them with extra costs of $5.4 billion a year.

By the tender age of 13, Robert Santholzer was half deaf and had a crippled knee thanks to what he says was faulty medical care in Czechoslovakia's socialized health-care system.
\
The Czech native, who says he has received ""much better"" care during the nearly 40 years he has spent in America, says he fears President Barack Obama's health-reform plans threaten to bring his childhood fears of socialized medicine to reality.
\
More than 400 people joined Santholzer to line the grassy lawn in front of Utah's Capitol Saturday in a ""tea party"" protest reminiscent of the revolutionary Tea Party in 1773 when colonists threw tea into the Boston Harbor to protest unfair taxes.
\
""We're bringing in natural gas from Russia and putting Americans out of jobs,"" said Travis Loss, who helped organize the Vernal tea party protest in April and the current rally. ""America doesn't have a never-ending credit limit. Our children will be stuck with that bill.""
\
More than 1,400 nationwide Independence Day rallies were planned for people to protest what they call unfair government actions.
\
Organizers offered speeches and helped set up booths to inform the people about some of the government changes being planned, including socialized health care and the cap and trade plan that would put a cap on greenhouse emissions.
\
Sandy resident Andrew Pullens proudly held a ""Liberty or Death"" flag representing the flag flown during the American Revolution.
\
""They're trying to push the cap and trade bill under while Michael Jackson died,"" said 25-year-old Kathleen House from Wallsburg. ""It would be capping what we could produce in energy and hike up the price. It would kill our economy.""
\
Others like Santholzer call the plan a move toward socialism.
\
""The idea of everyone having health care is a wonderful concept. The idea of having a clean environment is wonderful, too,"" Loss said. ""But who's financially responsible for it?""
\
Pullens spent 10 years overseas in Germany and other places with the U.S. Army, fighting against communism and watching people struggle in Berlin.
\
After 20 years of fighting for others to be free, Pullens said America must hold tightly to its own freedom.
\
""I was there when President Reagan said to (Mikhail) Gorbachev to take that wall down,"" said Pullens, 45.
\
Yet with the hot sun beating down and the July 4 holiday promising fireworks ahead, the crowd dispersed to about 200 after about an hour of speeches.
\
""The ultimate goal is to get people in our government who are going to represent us,"" Loss said. ""Right now, we just want to educate people on what's going on in our government.""

WASHINGTON -- Thursday, Mike Leavitt announced his first big decision as Environmental Protection Agency chief, proposing new rules aimed at reducing pollution from coal-fired power plants, mostly in the Eastern states.
\
Some environmental groups and Democratic presidential candidates, however, say that is not enough and that the move would benefit industry too much and the environment too little.
\
In response, Leavitt, the former Utah governor, said, ""These actions are the largest single investment in any clean air program in history"" and ""represent a historic achievement"" by helping protect the environment without unduly harming local economies.
\
Leavitt actually announced two rules proposals. The first set of rules aims to reduce power plants' emissions of mercury, which is highly toxic and can impair cognitive skills and harm reproductive, immune and endocrine systems in unborn children.
\
The other aims to reduce long-range transport of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which form ozone and fine-particulate pollution that contribute to respiratory problems.
\
If, after going through a review process, the rules are enacted, the EPA estimates the rules would reduce sulfur dioxide from current levels by 40 percent by 2010 and 70 percent by 2015.
\
The agency also estimates nitrogen oxides would be reduced by 50 percent by 2015 in the 30 states covered by the rules, and that mercury levels would be reduced by 70 percent when the rules are fully implemented after 2018.
\
Included in the proposal is a controversial pollution-trading system that would allow states, utilities and companies to trade pollution allowances as long as overall national caps are maintained. Environmental groups contend that could create local ""hot spots"" of danger.
\
Leavitt said in a speech earlier this week that the proposal follows his vision of ""national standards, local solutions."" He said cap-and-trade systems offer market incentives for plants to find ways to reduce emissions and offer flexibility in how standards will be achieved.
\
When the mercury proposal was leaked to the press earlier this week by the National Wildlife Federation, which had obtained a draft of it, it was quickly blasted by environmental groups and Democrats.
\
""To portray this rulemaking as a major step forward in cleaning the air . . . is complete hypocrisy,"" said Felice Stadler of the National Wildlife Federation. ""A cap-and-trade system doesn't work for mercury. Dangerously high levels of mercury will continue to pollute waterways near the worst polluters and endanger people and wildlife eating contaminated fish.""
\
Democratic presidential candidate Wesley Clark said the mercury rule amounts to ""giving power plants free reign to pollute."" Presidential candidate Howard Dean said the administration is ""selling our health, our environment and our economic security to its campaign contributors.""
\
And Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., accused the administration of ""choosing special interests over the health of children and families.""
\
The new proposals largely mirror -- and would administratively accomplish -- much of President Bush's ""Clear Skies"" legislative proposals in Congress, where they have stalled.
\
""While we continue to believe that the Clear Skies Act is the best approach to reducing power plant emissions, and we are committed to working with our congressional sponsors to move this landmark legislation through Congress, we must move forward with these steps now,"" Leavitt said.
\
The EPA plans to formally publish the proposed rules in the Federal Register and to take public comment later this month with the ultimate aim of finalizing the rules by 2005.
\
President Bush's current term ends in January, 2005.

NEWTON, Iowa -- Marking Earth Day with a pitch for his energy plan, President Barack Obama on Wednesday called for a ""new era of energy exploration in America"" and argued that his proposal would help the economy and the environment at once.
\
""The choice we face is not between saving our environment and saving our economy -- it's a choice between prosperity and decline,"" Obama said in his first post-election trip to Iowa, the state that launched him toward the White House. ""The nation that leads the world in creating new sources of clean energy will be the nation that leads the 21st century global economy.""
\
But Obama's promise of preserving natural resources and jump-starting the economy ran smack into the reality of this economically struggling town about 30 miles east of Des Moines. The wind energy plant where he spoke, and received a tour beforehand, is a shadow of what it replaced -- a Maytag Corp. appliances plant that built washers, dryers and refrigerators.
\
It employed some 4,000 in a town of 16,000 residents in jobs that paid about $30,000 to $40,000 a year.
\
Trinity Structural Towers has roughly 90 people working at the old Maytag site, a number that is expected to grow to about 140. Mark Stiles, a senior vice president at Trinity, which builds the towers that support wind turbines, said workers at his factory make about $17 an hour, plus benefits.
\
""This is a piece of the recovery, but we think it's a nice piece,"" Stiles said.
\
Newton Mayor Chaz Allen said many are still trying to recover after the loss of Maytag in 2007.
\
""You know, 115 years with one company was a great thing, but it's a different world now,"" Allen said. ""Our economy has to be diverse and we can't put all of our eggs in one basket.""
\
Obama was at the plant to highlight his energy proposal that has slowed on Capitol Hill. Skeptical Republicans and some Democrats from coal-producing states complain that it will increase costs for consumers, send jobs overseas and hurt businesses.
\
Obama said the nation needs more domestic production of oil and natural gas in the short term. But ""the bulk of our efforts,"" he said, must focus on transitioning the U.S. to more renewable energy.
\
He pushed personal responsibility, calling on every American to replace one incandescent light bulb with one compact fluorescent. The president also said the leaders of the world's major economies will meet next week to discuss the energy crisis.
\
For his remarks, Obama chose Iowa, second only to Texas in installed wind capacity.
\
He announced his administration is creating the nation's first program to authorize offshore projects to generate electricity from wind turbines and ocean currents. The Interior Department on Wednesday issued the long-awaited regulations governing how leases will be issued for the development of such energy sources and how revenue will be shared with coastal states.
\
Obama said that wind could generate as much as 20 percent of the U.S. electricity demand by 2030 if its full potential is pursued on land and offshore. It would also create as many as 250,000 jobs, he said.
\
""As with so many clean energy investments, it's win-win: good for environment and great for our economy,"" the president said.
\
But wind-produced electricity totals just under 2 percent of all electricity generated, according to the American Wind Energy Association, a trade group.
\
Obama's energy plan would reduce greenhouse gases by 20 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, and by 83 percent by mid-century. It calls for a series of measures aimed at reducing the use of fossil energy, such as requiring utilities to produce a quarter of their electricity from renewable sources.
\
The House began four days of hearings on its version of climate legislation on Tuesday.
\
GOP lawmakers have criticized the ""cap-and-trade"" portion of the measure, calling it a massive energy tax because it will put a price on carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels. But Obama defended it, saying, ""My hope is that this will be the vehicle through which we put this policy in effect.""
\
Obama's energy plan would drive more investments to companies such as Trinity.
\
The administration's economic stimulus plan also included some $5 billion for low-income weatherization programs and $2 billion for electric car research. Another $500 million was set aside to train workers for ""green jobs,"" such as those at Trinity.
\
Obama's post-inauguration travel itinerary reads like a list of battleground and Republican-leaning states that helped lift him to the presidency and will be critical in any re-election bid. He's visited Colorado, North Carolina, Indiana, Ohio, Florida and now Iowa.
\
Obama staged a surprise upset over one-time rival Hillary Rodham Clinton to win Iowa's caucuses in January 2008, giving him much-needed momentum that sparked a marathon nomination struggle. His Iowa field operation for 2012 is up and running, with town-hall meetings scheduled this week.
\
In Landover, Md., on Monday, Vice President Joe Biden marked Earth Day by announcing that $300 million in federal stimulus money will go to cities and towns to purchase more fuel-efficient vehicles.
"
15,"This fall, Congress faces a major economic and environmental decision that will affect the lives of all Americans: what to do about climate change. While some Americans question whether global warming is threatening our future, many federal legislators agree it must be addressed. How to do that is the multibillion-dollar question.\Congress' answer: Create a cap-and-trade market. Under this approach, the government caps the amount of carbon dioxide all companies can emit. The government then auctions or gives away ""emission allowances""-- each allowance being the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide. Experts estimate these auctions could amount to over $100 billion annually. Companies could then trade allowances on a ""carbon market"" open to everyone, including Wall Street players.\As a not-for-profit public power utility, we have a huge stake in this debate. Since our mandate is to provide reliable, reasonably priced electric service, while protecting the environment, the cost of climate change legislation is immensely important to us. Unlike investor-owned utilities, we can't absorb new cap-and-trade costs by trimming profit margins or reducing shareholder dividends. Especially in tough economic times, customers don't want us passing on additional costs or sacrificing service.\This month, the U.S. Senate debates the American Clean Energy and Security Act, H.R. 2454, a cap-and-trade bill that passed the U.S. House in June. The bill has shortcomings that could result in costs harmful to consumers, the economy and the reliability of our electric system, without providing any environmental benefit.\If Congress addresses climate change with a new multibillion-dollar market, they need to get it right.\The most important thing the Senate can do is place a ceiling on carbon allowance prices to ensure a cap-and-trade market does not result in runaway prices. Some want a ceiling and a floor to keep prices high enough to motivate changes in behavior without harming our economy. Since H.R. 2454 also contains mandatory reduction targets, emission reductions will occur. But prices must be capped to avoid volatility and limit risk to electricity customers.\Any cap-and-trade legislation should also allocate (not auction) emission allowances at no cost to public power and other local distribution utilities so they can pass their value directly to customers. Whether allowances are auctioned or allocated, the emissions cap means greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced. Competitive auctioning allowances would just increase prices.\To ensure unregulated generators do not receive windfall profits at the expense of consumers, allowances should be given only to local distribution utilities that directly serve retail customers. These entities are regulated by state and local governments that will require the value of allowances be passed on to customers. Unregulated ""merchant"" generators face no such restrictions and will likely pass that value on to their shareholders. The House climate change bill would allocate up to 10 percent of emission allowances for the electricity industry to merchant generators.\If lawmakers want to reduce greenhouse gas, community-owned power groups are asking our leaders to pass laws that are both fair and affordable. Current legislation falls woefully short of this goal. We urge citizens to join us in asking Sen. Orrin Hatch and Sen. Bob Bennett for a law that balances the needs of consumers, our economy and our environment.\Jack Taylor , public services director of Santa Clara, is chairman of the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems.

Utah and other members of the Western Climate Initiative on Tuesday announced support of an emissions-trading plan to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in the West.
\
After 18 months of discussions and public meetings, the coalition released what it calls its design recommendations for a cap-and-trade system. The coalition, which was established last year, includes seven Western states and four Canadian provinces.
\
""We're sending a strong message to our federal governments that states and provinces are moving forward in the absence of federal action, and we're setting the stage for national programs that are just as aggressive,"" California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said in a statement.
\
But some environmental groups said the recommendations don't go far enough and put too much control in states' hands. Business groups contended that Utah, with most of its energy coming from coal-fired power plants, would shoulder too much of the burden to reduce emissions in the region and then pass the cost on to consumers. Some Utah lawmakers also worried about the recommendations' potential impact on Utah businesses.
\
House Speaker Greg Curtis, R-Sandy, called reducing emissions a ""laudable"" goal. ""But we need to make sure we don't just wholesale forget about the economic impacts and the energy impacts of the policies we advance,"" he said. ""Doing it at the stake of driving away jobs and driving down the economy is something we need to be very mindful of.""
\
Senate President Jon Valentine, R-Orem, said he feared a carbon-trading program might put the state's businesses at a disadvantage in a global economy.
\
""We want to make certain we do not unnecessarily harm Utah businesses,"" Valentine said Tuesday. ""You can end up with such an aggressive approach that it hurts businesses in Utah and makes us not competitive.""
\
Dianne Nielson, Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr.'s energy adviser, said the coalition's recommendations mark the start of discussions at the state level ""that will continue with our Legislature and stakeholders to ensure the design works for Utah.""
\
Nielson said the next step will be to form a task force to figure out what type of legislation will be required to implement the coalition's recommendations. ""We're going to take a year, work with stakeholders, with legislative leaders, and figure out the best way to accomplish this and then deal with this in the 2010 legislative session,"" she said.
\
Only states' legislatures and regulatory agencies, not the coalition, have the power to enact or enforce the recommended emissions changes.
\
The coalition has focused on a ""market-based"" cap-and-trade system intended to dramatically cut climate-changing emissions. The Northeast and Midwest also have a similar Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.
\
Nielson said the Western initiative gives Utah a ""critical"" seat at the regional table to communicate a need for all energy resources while maintaining the state's coal-powered viability in a changing market.
\
The first phase of the cap-and-trade program is expected to begin Jan. 1, 2012, with coalition partners agreeing to begin reporting emissions in 2011 for emissions that occurred in 2010. A cap system for transportation fuels would be put in place in 2015.
\
The gases covered by Tuesday's recommendations are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. Emission sources include electricity generation, combustion at industrial and commercial facilities, and oil- and gas-process emissions.
\
The recommended strategy would limit emissions from major sources of greenhouse gases, while providing flexibility and economic benefits intended to spur continuous innovation of clean technologies, the coalition said.
\
The Environmental Protection Agency defines a cap-and-trade program as a means to limit overall emissions. Emitters would be allowed to release only a certain amount of pollutants. Emitters that stayed below their emissions limit and didn't use all of their allowances would be allowed to sell off the remaining allowances to other emitters that were either unable to meet their own limit or who found it cheaper to buy allowances instead if installing new pollution-control equipment.
\
Britt Weygandt, executive director of the Colorado-based Western Business Roundtable, said Tuesday in a prepared statement that Utah, which gets 90 percent of its electricity from coal-fired power plants, would need to do more to meet the limits than California, which gets less than 30 percent of its electricity from coal-fired power plants. Power companies would pass the costs of purchasing and installing pollution controls on to consumers, he said.
\
""Thus, Utah consumers will be forced to bear a disproportionately higher burden under this regulatory approach than will California consumers,"" Weygandt contended.
\
But Utah Department of Environmental Quality Executive Director Rick Sprott said Utah is in a position to provide leadership in the West and nationally to increase energy efficiency.
\
""This market-based approach can help achieve the reductions that are needed to meet Utah's goal of reducing our emissions to 2005 levels by 2020,"" Sprott said. The Western coalition's regional goal is to reduce emissions to 15 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.
\
Sen. Michael Waddoups, R-Taylorsville, said he's not a big believer in a cap-and-trade system that lets some polluters with money to spend on credits slip by without doing their share of reducing emissions.
\
""Everybody should be trying to cut back, not just find a way financially to continue to pollute,"" said Waddoups, a member of the Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment committee. National Wildlife Federation regional outreach coordinator Doug Howell said Tuesday that the coalition's recommendations ""did not send a strong enough signal that the interests of the public need to come before the interests of polluting industries.""
\
""Today's agreement gives significant discretion to individual states on whether to require industries to buy their pollution permits,"" he said. ""Giving away the right to pollute will undercut investments needed to move to a clean energy future and protect consumers and the region's natural resources.""

17,"Utah lawmakers appear receptive to bankrolling a $2 million legal challenge against the state of California over its climate policies, which they claim unfairly penalize electricity produced with Utah coal.\California’s laws aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions make Utah’s coal a more expensive choice for generating power, industry advocates and legislators complain — and rural Utah is paying a huge price in terms of lost employment and royalties that could support the state’s schools.\“It basically costs $28 more per ton of coal than other types of energy. That’s an impossible burden for the Utah coal industry,” said Denise Dragoo, attorney for mine operator Alton Coal Development, based in Cedar City.\In hopes of reversing the trend, Rep. Mike Noel, R-Kanab, is seeking to funnel $2 million to lawyers at Dragoo’s law firm in Salt Lake City to mount a federal counter-attack in what Noel has called “California’s war on Utah coal,” on grounds its policies violate the U.S. Constitution.\Noel’s budget proposal has drawn initial support from members of the Legislature’s Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee.\At Noel’s request, Dragoo’s firm Snell & Wilmer put together a spending plan budget for its private lawyers to litigate the case in Utah’s federal court. Dragoo said she would like to file the suit within two months, but it was not clear who the plaintiff would be.\“It would be helpful to have the state of Utah involved as a plaintiff because of interstate commerce,” Dragoo said.\Her proposed budget — which calls for spending $845,000 on expert witnesses and consultants, paid $650 an hour — covers court action only through a motion for summary judgment. A trial and any appeals would boost the cost substantially, but Noel isn’t worried.\“I’m thinking we win the case and we get our money back,” he said.\‘More bark than bite’\One California environmental policy expert, however, predicted the lawsuit Noel is pushing will accomplish little, aside from enriching industry lawyers at taxpayer expense.\“This law is not new to California,” Dan Jacobson, state director for Environment California, said of the state’s cap-and-trade system, passed in 2006. “The oil industry has tried to repeal the law in legislation, in the courts and at the ballot box. They lost every single time.”\“My guess is Utah is throwing $2 million at something that has more bark than bite,” Jacobson said.\While Noel derided California leaders for setting an example of how not to run a state, Jacobson contends the Golden State’s climate policies have helped spur a green-energy revolution that other states would be wise to embrace.\“California has every right to pursue clean-energy policies… and to use its place in the market as the world’s 6th-largest economy to help move California and the rest of the world away from fossil fuels toward clean energy,” Jacobson said.\He said he suspects the lawsuit seeks to set up “a race to the bottom,” where the dirtiest fuel sources get an advantage.\California ‘way out of bounds’\Noel — whose Utah legislative district includes Alton and immense untapped coal deposits under land removed from the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument — has decried California’s emissions-reducing program as an “excise” tax that unfairly renders Utah coal uncompetitive, in violation of the Constitution’s Commerce Clause.\In testimony earlier this week, Noel argued that California is imposing its values on other states, regardless of the cost to local economies that have invested heavily in fossil-fuel extraction.\“There is a contract and we have filled that contract for years and years to supply power to the people in that area and all of the sudden their political philosophy changes, and they don’t want the power,” Noel told colleagues.\“We have geared up and put these power plants in and we have our people working and we have our coal,” he continued. “It’s cut off and they don’t give a whiff about it.”\Added Rep. Carl Albrecht, R-Richfield, “California’s law is way out of bounds,” because there is no way to distinguish between electrons generated by coal or other fuels.\“For them to determine that there is a coal-fired electron is absurd to the maximum degree,” said Albrecht, a retired utility executive.\‘Coal is not dead’\Others argue that the impact of California’s system on Utah’s coal-reliant rural economies has been substantial.\The Coal Hollow mine employed 50 miners when it began digging coal from an open pit near Alton in 2011, with most of its output going to Intermountain Power Project outside Delta to generate electricity bound for southern California.\But IPPs purchases have since dropped off and are set to completely end by 2025, casting a pall of uncertainty over the mine which expects to land a fresh 30-million-ton federal lease this year, according to Larry Johnson, general manager for Alton Coal, which operates the mine.\“We are now [producing] under 600,000 tons a year and in turn that causes us a reduction in manpower,” Johnson told legislators. “We are under 40 percent than what we started with.”\Though it is opposed by the Sierra Club and other environmental groups, the proposed lawsuit has earned letters of support from the Utah Mining Association; Bowie Resource Partners, Utah’s largest coal producer and a key supplier to IPP; Bronco Utah Operations, which runs a mine in Emery County; leaders in Kane County; and Barney Trucking, a dry-bulk hauling company in West Valley City.\Officials with the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration, or SITLA, are also back the legal action.\“Every one loves to tell you coal is dead. I can tell you coal is not dead,” said SITLA director David Ure, whose agency has acquired coal deposits in land exchanges with the federal government.\“Over the last 60 days,” Ure said, “we are having more and more people knock on our doors asking what is the availability of coal in the state of Utah, specially under trust lands.”\Ure hopes to see five new mines similar to Coal Hollow open to tap reserves on SITLA land holdings, which he says would generate $155 million in annual royalties\‘Small price to pay’\In addition to seeking legal fees and an injunction against California’s “carbon tax,” the lawsuit would also challenge another California law banning the importation of coal-fired electrons after the expiration of existing contracts, according to documents marked “confidential” that were unintentionally posted online.\North Dakota has successfully challenged a similar Minnesota law, according to Dragoo. Snell & Wilmer has assembled a legal team that includes the firm that won that case, as well as the lawyer who represented the California Chamber of Commerce in its efforts to block California’s rules.\The Utah Attorney General’s Office would oversee the litigation, but all the work would be done by outside counsel and consultants.\Sen. Jim Dabakis, D-Salt Lake City, said he was troubled that the firm recommending the suit would also get the lucrative contract to run the case. Other House committee members wanted coal companies to foot some of the bill.\But for Noel, the state’s investment could pay huge dividends given the vastness of Utah’s coal deposits that could be generating royalties and jobs.\Spending $2 million, Noel said, “to protect several hundred million in funding for the school children is a small price to pay. I’m confident in this law firm that we can win this lawsuit.”\Credit: By Brian Maffly"

SALT LAKE CITY -- With most Democrats voting no, the Utah House approved a resolution Tuesday that questions global warming while asking the federal government not to proceed with ""cap-and-trade"" legislation or CO2 regulation.
\
Sponsor Rep. Kerry Gibson, R-Ogden, a dairy farmer, agreed to have his HJR12 amended to take out some inflammatory wording, like calling global warming and those who advocate it guilty of ""tricks,"" and a ""conspiracy"" and ""flawed"" research.
\
Gibson said some argue that if the Environmental Protection Agency goes forward with cap and trade on CO2, it could lead to a ""cow tax.""
\
Then cows like his own could be measured for ""belches"" and other gases they produce, which in turn could lead to a head tax that would increase the cost of milk and meat to consumers.
\
""I believe in global warming,"" Gibson said. ""I believe in global cooling, in (weather) cycles. We've had an ice age, extreme heat,"" but can humans, ""in our everyday lives,"" change the environment around us?
\
Instead, through inaccurate data and a general type of hysteria, the public has been pushed to make improper judgments, he said. And adopting CO2 cap and trade would be a diabolical mistake. Such action is really ""an energy tax"" that will harm all Americans, harm jobs in this country and likely have little or no effect on global warming.
\
Reps. Sheryl Allen, R-Bountiful, and Christine Johnson, D-Salt Lake, said should the EPA actually follow the advice of HJR12, Utah could lose EPA grants for research on clean air and funds for refitting school buses to make them less polluting.
\
EPA money ""has helped Utah schoolchildren,"" Johnson said.
\
But the idea that CO2 is somehow detrimental to humans, or to the earth, brought Rep. Mike Noel, R-Kanab, out of his chair.
\
""CO2 does not give us red days"" of air pollution warnings on the Wasatch Front, he said. ""That is absolutely untrue.""
\
""First do no harm,"" said Noel. And cap and trade will do great harm, he added.
\
Rep. David Litvak, D-Salt Lake, read from a letter by scientists ""at that radical university -- BYU,"" which said politicians should not be attacking scientists or science that they, for political reasons, disagree with.
\
That is a reference to Noel, who has criticized local scientists who have testified that global warming is a fact, that human activity contributes to it, and that actions should be quickly taken to fight it.
\
HJR12 passed 56-17 and now goes to the Senate for consideration. A resolution is a sentiment of the Legislature, has no force of law, and it's questionable whether congressmen or federal agency officials even read those sent to them.

There are parallels to be drawn between indulgences of the 16th century and today's cap and trade. The complaints Martin Luther nailed to the church door at Wittenberg suggest he doubted that the driving force behind the sin license was the welfare of the sinner's soul. Congressional motives behind the carbon tax are not any purer. Would this government seizure of industrial earnings be used to rescue the environment? Social Security stands as a monument to the pains taken by Congress to apply funds to the purposes for which they are collected.

In August, New York-based Och-Ziff committed up to $500 million (with an additional $500 million available) for new greenhouse gas reduction projects to be managed in partnership with Blue Source.
\
Two months later, Goldman Sachs bought a minority stake in the Holladay carbon-management firm for an undisclosed amount. The deal represented an equity stake of less than 10 percent, said Bill Townsend, co-founder and chief executive officer of Blue Source. Townsend declined to comment on the financial terms of the deal.
\
""As European and now U.S. regulators adopt regulations addressing climate change and create a market for carbon, we are developing new products to address these new commodities risk to our clients,"" a Goldman Sachs spokesman said in an e-mail to the Deseret News regarding the decision to form a business alliance with Blue Source. ""The alliance, which will offer our clients access to a diverse selection of emission reductions to manage their carbon risks, is one of the key components of our carbon strategy in the U.S.""
\
As Utah and the rest of the nation consider ways to reduce its carbon footprint, companies like Blue Source have developed technologies that mitigate carbon emissions. Townsend said he is hopeful the U.S. will follow the lead of Europe, which has begun its own regulated carbon-trading market, permitting entities to buy and sell credits or reductions as a way to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.
\
Though some analysts have supported the idea of a federally regulated American carbon-trading market, critics have expressed concerns about how well such a program would work when put into practice. Would it be administered fairly? And would trading carbon credits on the open market achieve the desired result of mitigating climate change and reducing the amount of pollutants in the air?
\
Regulating the market
\
Currently, there is no nationally regulated carbon-trading market, though companies are able to exchange carbon offsets on their own. A carbon offset is a financial instrument representing a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
\
One carbon offset represents the reduction of one metric ton of carbon dioxide, or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases.
\
The two primary markets for carbon offsets are the larger compliance market and the smaller voluntary market.
\
In the compliance market, companies, governments or other entities buy carbon offsets in order to comply with caps on the total amount of carbon dioxide they are allowed to emit into the atmosphere. In the voluntary market, individuals, companies or governments purchase carbon offsets to mitigate their own greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, electricity use, industrial production or other sources.
\
Last week, Blue Source announced the first issuance of U.S.-based greenhouse gas offsets from projects approved by the Voluntary Carbon Standard. The offsets totaled more than 1.6 million voluntary carbon units, according to a news release.
\
The offsets were registered on the VCS Registry system, a global benchmark standard for voluntary greenhouse gas emission reductions and removals developed by The Climate Group, the International Emissions Trading Association and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, along with numerous business, government and non-government organizations, the release said.
\
""Interest in the pre-compliance carbon market in the U.S. is growing rapidly, and we are excited to be able to offer our clients immediate access to a diverse selection of emission reductions to manage their carbon risk,"" said Leslie Biddle, Goldman Sachs' global head of commodity sales.
\
Europe already has a regulated carbon-trading market -- the European Trading System -- that has drawn some criticism from analysts and observers.
\
Hans Ehrbar, economics professor at the University of Utah, said the European market has had its share of issues since its inception in January 2005.
\
Carbon credits were initially dispersed for free, Ehrbar said, with most of the available credits allocated to companies that were already among the biggest polluters in Europe. Issuing valuable credits at no cost to companies because they were responsible for the greatest amount of carbon emissions was a flawed strategy on the part of European policymakers, he said.
\
""The fair way would be to have those carbon credits auctioned off so that everyone who needs them has to pay for them,"" Ehrbar said. ""Basically, they want to buy the support of the big polluters for programs like this.""
\
Cap and trade
\
Ehrbar also expressed concern about a proposed ""cap-and-trade"" program that would take an administrative approach to control pollution by providing economic incentives for achieving reductions in the emissions of carbon pollutants.
\
During a nationally televised February speech to Congress, President Barack Obama voiced his administration's support for the development of a cap-and-trade system to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency defined cap and trade as ""a market-based policy tool for protecting human health and the environment.""
\
The cap-and-trade program favored by the president would set limits on carbon-dioxide emissions and let companies trade pollution allowances on a market.
\
That approach is also favored by state energy advisor Dianne Nielson, who told the Deseret News that a potential carbon-trading market could be the key to a successful emissions reduction program in Utah.
\
""The market forces, we believe, are in fact the best approach in terms of looking at the value and reduction of CO2 and other greenhouse gases,"" Nielson said.
\
An important component of any market-based plan, she said, would be the ability to verify the existence of offsets.
\
""The climate registry is one mechanism where you can provide information on carbon reductions,"" Nielson said.
\
In addition, there should be an independent audit process that would verify that the actual carbon reductions were truly achieved and long-lasting, she said.
\
""That's something that's going to be important to all state agencies as we move forward in carbon management,"" Nielson said.
\
Taking initiative
\
Utah is among the seven American states and four Canadian provinces involved in the Western Climate Initiative, she said. WCI was created to identify, evaluate and implement collective and cooperative ways to reduce greenhouse gases in the region, focusing on a market-based cap-and-trade system, according to its Web site, www.westernclimateinitiative.org.
\
Members of the Western Climate Initiative include Arizona, California, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec.
\
Nearly 90 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in the states and provinces will be covered by the cap when it is fully implemented in 2015, according to the Web site.
\
The plan has drawn opposition from some observers, including many members of the Utah Legislature.
\
According to the Associated Press, a Colorado-based business group issued a report last year criticizing a carbon-trading plan offered by the seven U.S. governors and four Canadian provincial premiers, saying it would be ineffective and would discourage investment.
\
The Western Business Roundtable report, issued in September 2008, took aim at the Western Climate Initiative, claiming the plan was based on ""problematic assumptions.""
\
The Denver-based Western Business Roundtable includes CEOs and leaders of organizations doing business in the West.
\
Setting limits, reaching goals
\
Environmental advocates note that the development of carbon-trading markets in North America has already begun and could increase with continued support from the new presidential administration.
\
""Even if it doesn't happen at the national level, there are various proposals for regional cap-and-trade programs,"" said Bill Magavern, director of the California chapter of the Sierra Club.
\
A small program exists in the Northeast, but it ""only applies to power-plant emissions,"" Magavern said.
\
Because the limits or cap imposed on the emissions in that program were so high, meaning they were too lax, he said, the impact on the environment would likely be minimal.
\
For any cap-and-trade program to be effective, realistic limits need to be required and ""the polluters should have to pay for"" any allowances or credits they would have under the system, Magavern said. An auction would be the best way to distribute those credits, with entities holding surplus offsets able to sell them or preferably retain them, he said.
\
Trading on the open market would probably be minimal if companies were required to purchase offsets, Magavern said, because it would be in their best interest to keep them in order to reduce their future greenhouse gas output.
\
""We don't think the goal is to have trading,"" he said. ""The goal is to bring emissions down. ... You need to have a system that's got strong oversight by a governmental entity to make sure that any kind of offsets are permanent and verified.""
\
An emerging market
\
In the United States, credits or offsets from projects that reduce global-warming gases are voluntarily traded by companies and others seeking to enhance their environmental image. Congress is debating legislation that would mandate emissions reductions, a move that could expand the market for the type of credits offered by Blue Source.
\
More customers are buying emissions credits with the expectation that they may be used to meet mandatory pollution targets in the future, Townsend said. Credits from projects that destroy methane from landfills or that capture and bury carbon dioxide underground are worth about $10 a ton, less than half the cost of credits in the European Union greenhouse gas market.
\
With its strong financial backing, Blue Source is poised to become one of the biggest players in the emerging world of climate-change capitalism in the U.S. and abroad. The firm has developed technology that captures carbon dioxide emissions from various industrial production processes, including methane gas from coal mining, wastewater treatment, landfills and animal waste, as well as storage of carbon dioxide from fertilizer, natural gas production and industrial gas destruction.
\
Building Blue Source
\
Prior to his involvement with Blue Source, Townsend was co-owner of seven energy or environmental businesses. He said that he performed his first carbon trade in 1996, but little did he know that it would lead to the opportunity that was before Blue Source today.
\
""We were the second one in the nation done,"" he said. Since then, his companies have developed carbon-reduction projects in several states, including Kansas, Louisiana, Texas and Wyoming, Townsend said.
\
Eventually, that experience served him well as he watched the climate market grow and then met the man who would become his friend and business partner.
\
Greg Spencer, Blue Source's president and co-founder, said he came upon the partnership opportunity after his job was eliminated following a merger.
\
""He and I got together and decided to build a business with the objective of creating the largest, most diversified carbon portfolio in North America,"" Spencer said.
\
When they started out in 2000, there were few people who even comprehended the idea of carbon trading, he said. Traditional pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide had already been trading under the Clean Air Act for some time.
\
""Very few people in the U.S. had heard about or been involved with trading of greenhouse gases,"" Spencer said.
\
Townsend and Spencer got together in the fall of 2000 and decided on a corporate business plan to build a portfolio based on the development of carbon trading, Spencer said. Soon after, they introduced the concept to executives with large companies such as Tyson Foods, trucking firm J.B. Hunt, International Paper, energy company Kinder Morgan and Albertsons.
\
Spencer described them as ""big organizations with huge energy footprints"" that presented the opportunity for significant reductions in carbon emissions.
\
""We put together a business approach that enabled us to take all of the up-front costs and a significant amount of the risk, and really just give them the opportunity to participate,"" he said.
\
Townsend said they typically look for ""large single-point sources of carbon dioxide that are being emitted into the atmosphere.""
\
That would usually be large facilities such as refineries, natural gas treatment plants or other industrial facilities.
\
Leading the way
\
Currently, the company has more than 30 projects in nine states across the country, Townsend said. The only Blue Source-built project located in Utah is a small hydro-electric generator at the Big Canyon Ranch in the Summit County town of Wanship.
\
The 3-kilowatt generator was constructed with funds donated by Blue Source and utilizes an underground stream to supply a clean source of energy that provides all of the electricity needs of the 1,500-acre Christian adventure retreat, director Brian Zwahlen said.
\
With its experienced leadership and proven technologies, Blue Source is already one of the top carbon-management companies in the nation, Townsend said, and he's excited about the prospects for growth in the coming years. He said it was his company's overall profitability that piqued the interest of investors such as Goldman Sachs and Och-Ziff that resulted in the current billion-dollar business relationships.
\
Blue Source's alliances with major capital firms could help the company become a global leader in carbon-management industry, he said.
\
""In a very positive way, we are leading the way in climate change, and the state should be proud of that,"" Townsend said.

21,"A legislative committee Tuesday advanced to the full Senate a nonbinding resolution advising Utah Gov. Gary Herbert to withdraw from the Western Climate Initiative.\Former Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. signed on to the multistate alliance to help develop a regional carbon cap-and-trade program, which advocates say could be a way to lessen global climate disruption from greenhouse gas emissions.\HJR21 sponsor Rep. Mike Noel, R-Kanab, told members of the Senate Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Environment Committee that scientists accused of manipulating climate data were involved in ""criminal activities"" and that it is time to leave the alliance but still observe its activities.\University of Utah bioengineering professor Joseph Andrade urged continued participation in the initiative as a way to show leadership on climate matters, even though Utah is a small state, for the sake of coming generations.\The bill already has cleared the House.\Patty Henetz\Credit: The Salt Lake Tribune"
22,"By Stephen Stromberg\The Washington Post\Will states take the easy way?\The Environmental Protection Agency will soon demand that states cut their greenhouse-gas emissions. You would think that state leaders, particularly Republicans warning of an EPA regulatory apocalypse, would be frantically reaching for the least onerous strategies to comply. But so far many have shown more interest in lambasting the EPA than in accepting the sorts of policies that would make new carbon regulations easiest on people.\The way states comply with the EPA matters. The agency figures that if states banded together into regional greenhouse-gas-cutting pacts, the total cost of the Obama administration's clean-power rule would drop by 17 percent. Even absent a push from the EPA, states should adopt regional, market-based carbon policy because it's the cheapest way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, a goal all states should share. With the EPA's impending carbon mandate, it's an even easier policy choice. But with a few exceptions, it's one that states still aren't making.\California is one of the exceptions. Gov. Jerry Brown, Democrat, touted his state's carbon dioxide program at a Friday meeting with Post writers and editors, drawing particular attention to its cap-and-trade program. Cap-and-trade has endured a lot of right-wing abuse over the past several years, but a well-designed program is, in fact, a market-based approach and among the most efficient ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Indeed, several Western states moved to cooperate with California to create a multi-state cap-and-trade agreement. But California was the only state that followed through.\One would expect Western governors to beat down Brown's door, revive the regional cap-and-trade plan and ask the EPA to give them credit for the resulting carbon dioxide cuts. But, astonishingly, Brown said that not a single governor has asked him about this.\Around the same time California created its carbon market, a group of Northeastern states established their own cap-and-trade scheme, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Eastern states can join RGGI and take that to the EPA. Some Republicans have acknowledged the idea's merit. Virginia Del. Ronald Villanueva tried to persuade his fellow GOP legislators to join RGGI this year. They didn't take his advice.\The positive view is that state leaders still have time before the EPA's rules phase in, and more will accept the smart approach as the EPA clarifies its requirements and as deadlines approach.\The negative view is that, whether out of ideology or poor judgment, state officials will continue their negligent approach to carbon dioxide emissions. States such as Texas have made a virtue of defying the EPA in the past. But states will have to comply, the easy way or the hard way. Which to choose should already be a matter of bipartisan consensus in every statehouse.\Stephen Stromberg is a Washington Post editorial writer. He specializes in domestic policy, including energy, the environment, legal affairs and public health."
23,"
WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats are pushing for a 20 percent cut in greenhouse gases by 2020 -- deeper than what the House has passed and what President Barack Obama wants -- according to a long-awaited bill that will test how serious the U.S. is about slowing global warming.
\
The Democratic bill is to be released Wednesday by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee with a vote by the panel likely in late October.
\
House Democrats could win passage of only a 17 percent emission cut by 2020, and Obama originally had sought only a 14 percent cut. However, aides who worked on the Senate version said it includes measures that will make the Senate's target easier to achieve and cheaper for consumers.
\
The bill obtained by The Associated Press remains subject to change. But the overall carbon reduction requirements are expected to stand.
\
The bill includes an economy-wide cap and trade system that would require power plants, industrial facilities and refineries to cut carbon dioxide and other climate-changing pollution. While there would be an overall emission cap, polluters would be able to purchase emission allowances to limit reductions. The bill, however, does not lay out how emission allowances would be distributed, a contentious issue left for resolving later.
\
The bill will become the starting point for difficult Senate negotiations in coming months as Democratic leaders seek to work out compromises to garner the 60 votes needed for passage.
\
""It's a bill with all comers in mind,"" said David Doniger, climate policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, adding there are several blank spots to be filled in.
\
The 800-page bill calls for a ceiling on greenhouse gas emissions beginning in three years, to be tightened annually so that emissions would be 20 percent lower in 2020 than they were in 2005. Emissions would have to be 83 percent lower by 2050. While the long-term cuts are the same as required by the House in June, the Senate bill has bigger early targets, something many in industry oppose.
\
Democratic aides said information released since the House acted the 20 percent reduction by the end of the next decade will be easier to meet. U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping gas targeted in the bill, already are 6 percent lower than what they were in 2005, a reduction attributed largely to the economic recession, according to the Energy Department.
\
The bill includes provisions that its sponsors argue would help avoid severe energy price spikes as the economy shifts more and more away from cheaper fossil fuels, especially coal for electricity production. It would hold emission allowances in reserve so they can be made available if energy prices soar, said the Democratic aides who spoke on condition of anonymity in advance of the bill's release.
\
The Democratic bill will be co-sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., the environment committee's chairman, and Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., two of the Senate's strongest advocates for aggressive action to counter global warming. It is expected to be taken up, and likely be approved, by Boxer's committee in the coming weeks despite opposition from GOP members.
\
Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the committee's ranking Republican and a sharp critic of climate legislation, said he expects that Democrats will be able to push the bill through committee. But he urged Boxer to have a ""fair, open and transparent process"" and not add key parts of the bill ""at the last minute"" as did House Democrats.
\
As the bill began to circulate among environmental organizations, it became clear the legislation is viewed by both supporters and opponents as largely a beginning for what is expected to be intense and difficult discussions and debate among senators in the coming months over climate legislation.
\
""It's a starting point for negotiations,"" said Anthony Kreindler, a spokesman for the Environmental Defense Fund, a leading proponent of cap-and-trade measures to deal with climate. ""There are going to be efforts to strengthen it and efforts to weaken it.""
\
Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's trade group, said the bill fails to make clear how it will constrain carbon dioxide emissions and ""appears to be following the (House) pattern ... which resulted in a political bidding process that picked winners and losers.""
\
Republicans, with few exceptions, have voiced strong opposition to cap-and-trade climate legislation calling it a massive energy tax on consumers as energy prices increase amid the shift away from fossil fuels. And many centrist Democrats -- especially from rural areas and from states with energy intensive industries -- have expressed reluctance to support any bill that does not protect against energy cost spikes and protect domestic industries.
\
The Senate draft does not spell out how emission allowances will be distributed, leaving one of the most contentious issues to further negotiations. The House would provide for free 85 percent of emission allowances to various industries, especially electric utilities to help reduce the cost to consumers.
"
24,"Republicans are trying to sell the false premise that protecting the environment inevitably means sacrificing jobs. President Obama should denounce this snake oil for what it is rather than appear to accept it.\The GOP presidential candidates are in remarkable agreement on two articles of faith: The human imagination, apparently, is incapable of conjuring any circumstance under which any tax may ever be raised. And the Environmental Protection Agency is a sinister laboratory where Birkenstock-shod evildoers conjure regulations purposefully designed to rob Americans of their jobs.\Actually, I'm being somewhat unfair to Mitt Romney, who tempers his EPA-bashing with the admission that he supports the agency ""in much of its mission."" When he was governor of Massachusetts, Romney favored initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, perhaps even a regional cap-and-trade system. He doesn't bring this up much on the campaign trail, but his opponents do.\The other contenders range from anti-EPA all the way to ... well, to Michele Bachmann's pledge to abolish the agency. Bachmann told an Iowa crowd last month that if she is elected president, ""I guarantee you the EPA will have doors locked and lights turned off, and they will only be about conservation. It will be a new day and a new sheriff in Washington.""\At the GOP debate in New Hampshire, Bachmann added that ""there is no other agency like the EPA. It should really be renamed the Job-Killing Organization of America."" Newt Gingrich agrees that the EPA - established in 1970 by that noted tree-hugger, Richard Nixon - should be dismantled.\Rick Perry has an actual record as an EPA-basher, having taken the agency to court in an effort to block rules on greenhouse gas emissions. Obama's ""EPA regulations are killing jobs all across America,"" Perry said. His book ""Fed Up!"" cites an estimate by the conservative Heritage Foundation of catastrophic job losses from greenhouse gas rules. Perry also refers to Al Gore as ""a false prophet of a secular carbon cult,"" whatever on Earth that means.\Ron Paul says most environmental questions should be resolved through the courts. Herman Cain and Jon Huntsman take the orthodox position: that any new environmental regulations should be put on hold because enacting them would kill jobs.\Last week, Obama appeared to cede the point. He blocked new EPA rules limiting ground-level ozone - otherwise known as smog - as part of a larger effort to reduce ""regulatory burdens and regulatory uncertainty"" for U.S. businesses. The move came hours after a disappointing labor report showing that the economy added no new jobs in August.\The move to block the ozone rules may make sense politically since it defuses an issue on which Republicans were prepared to hammer Obama and the Democrats all year. As a matter of public policy, however, it's wrong.\In developing the rule that Obama nixed, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson was simply fulfilling the agency's prime mission: protecting human health.\As for the predictions of massive job losses, they sound just like the warnings we heard when environmental regulations ended acid rain, or ensured that the citizens of Cleveland no longer had to worry about the Cuyahoga River catching fire.\There is plenty of evidence that the net effect of smart environmental regulation is to create jobs, not destroy them. New, more efficient plants are built; older, dirtier facilities are retrofitted. Companies innovate by developing new technology - ultimately making U.S. industry more competitive. And everyone is a little healthier.\We don't have to choose between jobs and health. History demonstrates we can have both.\Write Eugene Robinson at eu generobinson@washpost.com."
25,"One of the world's biggest energy companies also is a big backer of putting a price on carbon.\On Wednesday, Rio Tinto, the parent company of Kennecott, will tell the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming why it wants sensible climate-change regulation -- whether a carbon tax, cap-and-trade or some other pollution-fighting policy -- to bring more certainty to its business.\Preston Chiaro, who oversees Rio Tinto's Technology & Innovation Group from a Salt Lake Valley office, said the international mining company is eager for more predictability -- and soon -- so that it can plan for the future. The company has tried to figure carbon pricing into its strategy for more than a decade, he added, amid mounting scientific evidence of human-caused climate disruption.\""These changes are happening. They sure seem to be caused by human emissions, and we think that at some point governments will act,"" Chiaro said. ""We, as a business, have to figure out how we can survive and succeed in that changing world. We ultimately think there will be a price on carbon.""\Rio Tinto has a lot on the line. The company reported worldwide revenues of $41.8 billion last year and profits of $4.9 billion. It boasts 65,000 employees. In Utah, its largest enterprises are the Bingham Canyon copper mine and Kennecott Land development.\Last fall, Chiaro warned the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works that Rio Tinto sees unmanaged climate change as ""a threat to our assets, our shareholders and our employees, and also to civil society and political institutions in many of the countries in which we operate across the globe.""\The company is the only coal producer in the 14-member U.S. Climate Action Partnership, a coalition of major companies and environmental groups.\Not only is Rio Tinto concerned about higher costs for energy required to run its business, but it also sees opportunities to sell more commodities, such as copper and aluminum, that could be used in climate-control technologies.\Energy industry lobbyist Frank Maisano said he expects at least part of Wednesday's hearing to shift its attention to industry-safety issues after the recent deaths of 29 miners in West Virginia.\""This is going to put a big spotlight back on [Rep. Ed] Markey's committee,"" Maisano said, by focusing on the news of the day rather than climate legislation.\Utah Rep. Roger Barrus, R-Centerville, said he hasn't heard about Kennecott or other Utah companies calling for carbon regulation. He said he has heard just the opposite.\""I wish we could move forward without putting a value on carbon,"" Barrus said. ""The question of [regulation certainty] is on everybody's mind, but that's just not the kind of certainty most Utah companies want, because they don't want to be taxed twice, once on carbon and once on technology"" to control it.\Dianne Nielson, Gov. Gary Herbert's energy adviser, agrees that Rio Tinto's view is uncommon in Utah. She pointed to testimony and legislative measures earlier this year, including a resolution opposing federal efforts to regulate carbon emissions.\Instead of looking to state and federal government to address climate change, she noted, many have opted to do what they can on their own.\""There's quite a bit that can be accomplished,"" Nielson said, ""by individuals as well as companies that are interested in doing something.""\Hearing set\The House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming will hear from coal industry representatives Wednesday morning in Washington, D.C.\Credit: By Judy Fahys The Salt Lake Tribune"
26,"Jon Huntsman Jr. saw a bright future for Westerners when, shortly after signing up his state for a regional cap-and-trade program four years ago, he touted what they had to gain from tackling climate pollution.\""If we do this right,"" said Huntsman, who would win a second term as Utah's governor the following year, ""our citizens are going to have a better quality of life, we're going to spawn new technologies and industries, and we're going to leave our most important belongings in better shape for the next generation.""\But now, in a political environment rocked by recession and a rowdy tea party, and with Huntsman's eyes on a possible presidential run in 2012, his position has evolved. He's still defending the science of climate change, but he's ditched his support for cap-and-trade.\Huntsman said in Time magazine a few weeks ago, soon after stepping down as U.S. ambassador to China, that the regional cap-and-trade program he formally endorsed and promoted, the Western Climate Initiative, ""hasn't worked."" Because of the recession, ""this isn't the moment"" for climate change policies, he added.\It's a position shared in varying degrees by other GOP contenders, including Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich and Tim Pawlenty, all of whom were past supporters of cap-and-trade -- a strategy to reduce greenhouse gases using a sort of commodities-trading model.\But Huntsman -- in contrast to Gingrich, Pawlenty and tea party favorites like Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul -- maintains that scientists are right --- climate change is a real concern, ""an issue that ought to be answered by the scientific community.""\""All I know is 90 percent of the scientists say climate change is occurring,"" he told Time. ""If 90 percent of the oncological community said something was causing cancer, we'd listen to them.\""I respect science and the professionals behind the science,"" he continued. ""...though we can debate what [the scientific community's conclusion] means for the energy and transportation sectors.""\The comments -- that climate science is right but climate policy is not for right now -- stake out a position for Huntsman, the former head of the Huntsman Cancer Foundation, as a moderate. And that could be just the sort of candidate voters are looking for in the general election.\Lexi Shultz, who watches climate and energy policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said candidates snub the climate issue at their own risk.\""There's a lot of general public support for climate solutions,"" she said. ""The GOP may be painting themselves into a box by denying climate science and resisting climate solutions when it comes to the general election.""\But the reality is, Huntsman, like any other GOP hopeful, first has to survive the conservative-dominated Republican primaries.\That's a highly questionable proposition for Huntsman, say climate-change skeptics like Marc Morano.\A former GOP Senate staffer who runs the prominent blog ClimateDepot.com, Morano declared Huntsman ""DOA"" as a GOP nominee, at least in part because of his positions on climate change.\""That's not going to fly with the GOP voters,"" he said, adding that many Republican voters won't be able to trust Huntsman given his former support for cap-and-trade and his continuing support for climate science. ""I don't think they'll even consider him in the first place.""\Rejection of the notion of man-caused climate change and of the solution of cap-and-trade appears to be an article of faith for conservatives. For evidence, one has to look no further than the Utah Legislature and the demise of the former governor's climate-related initiatives shortly after his departure.\Last year, just a few months after Huntsman became U.S. Ambassador for China, lawmakers passed resolutions urging the governor to pull out of the Western Climate Initiative and resisting greenhouse-gas regulation given, among other things, ""questionable climate data.""\This year, the Republican-dominated Legislature repealed the four-day workweek that Huntsman had implemented at the suggestion of his two-year Blue-Ribbon Advisory Committee on climate change. Lawmakers even mustered the two-thirds vote to override a veto by Huntsman's successor, Gov. Gary Herbert. At the same time, executive branch staff members who used to work on climate change have been reassigned.\Myron Ebell of Freedom Action, a Web-based political action group affiliated with the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute, called Huntsman ""a disappointment"" as governor who, as an urbanite, was always ""out of touch"" with the interests of the rural West. His positions on climate change make Huntsman ""pretty close to being disqualified for the GOP,"" Ebell said.\""Global warming as an issue is dead,"" said Ebell, a native of rural western Oregon. ""The American people have made up their mind.""\The assessment is far different from those who see climate policy as a continuing concern for a majority of Americans.\Earlier this year, before Huntsman backed away from cap-and-trade, the progressive magazine Mother Jones called him ""the most climate-cognizant contender for the Republican presidential nomination.""\""In fact,"" the article said, ""he downright looks like a climate hawk.""\That, of course, was then, and now some wonder if Huntsman might eventually back away from the science, too.\At least for now, Navin Nayak, who leads the League of Conservation Voters' candidate advocacy program in Washington, gives Huntsman credit for standing behind scientific conclusions about climate change, which have actually grown stronger in recent years as political fashion has tilted against the scientific evidence.\Meanwhile, the GOP presidential contenders who disavow climate science could actually be creating a political liability for themselves, he said.\""I'm not sure the GOP electorate is going to buy those phony changes in positions,"" Nayak said. ""People who flip-flopped have raised questions about their character.""\Huntsman's climate views shift with an eye on the future\--\A Huntsman-climate timeline\2006 - Utah's GOP Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. organizes a panel to assess climate change that commissions a science report and develops a climate to-do list. Recommendations that are implemented in 2008 include emissions targets to reduce greenhouse gasses to 2005 levels by 2020, an energy-saving four-day workweek for state government employees and a non-binding renewable portfolio standard.\2007 - Utah becomes the 31st state to join the Climate Registry, an organization focused on measuring, tracking and verifying emissions of greenhouse gasses blamed for climate pollution.\A few weeks later, Huntsman signs onto the Western Climate Initiative, making Utah the seventh state (and one of two states led by GOP governors) to be part of an effort to create a regional cap-and-trade program.\The Western Governor's Association leaders, with Huntsman as vice chairman, throws its support behind the regional climate efforts the following month, and Huntsman appears in a climate-action television commercial with fellow governors California Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger and Montana Democrat Brian Schweitzer. Huntsman continues that priority during his term as chairman, from 2008-2009.\2009 - President Barack Obama taps Huntsman to be U.S. Ambassador to China.\2010 - The Legislature scales back Utah's climate program with resolutions to opt out of the Western Climate Initiative and to protest a new federal climate regulation, which lawmakers say is based on corrupt and faulty science.\--\What is cap and trade?\Cap-and-trade proposals use market forces to reduce the pollution blamed for climate disruption by making avoidance of greenhouse gases a commodity that can be traded like metals or crops.\Credit: By Judy Fahys The Salt Lake Tribune"
27,"Caution: Do not confuse this column with the accurate and unbiased reporting of facts - while the following facts may be accurate, I freely admit that I'm extremely biased in the way I present them!\A visiting alien might assume by watching recent news programming that Michael Jackson was the head of state of a G-8 country. The truth is the heads of state of those countries received far less media attention during the past few weeks than Jackson did.\Because the M.J. coverage preempted most real news stories recently, I feel it incumbent to report on the news that we have missed - news on government-run heath care, the California budget debacle, state lotteries and news in the global warming arena (also known as Cap and Trade).\Writing on these topics gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling that falls somewhere between the anticipation of a vasectomy and the dull ache of having to endure a Michael Moore film.\As far as health care is concerned, politicians speaking in the news media would have us believe that government-run health care would end up operating about as efficiently as F.E.M.A.\Recently my opinion has been swayed a bit by this observation broadcast on the BBC: ""Which would be better for the Americans: Government-run health care or what they now have, which is Wall Street-run health care?""\During the time we were experiencing an abundance of Michael Jackson coverage there was a dearth of coverage on California's $26.3 billion budget shortfall. The ""Golden State's interim solution was to issue IOUs.\Even Bank of America Corporation, which was so inept in recognizing bad debt risks that it recently needed $20 billion in government bail-out money, isn't too keen on accepting IOUs from the state of California, since the IOUs can't be redeemed until Oct. 2 at the earliest.\If Bank of America won't accept California's IOUs (even with the Feds guaranteeing up to $118 billion in ""Bad assets"") then, perhaps it's time for the state of California to visit a ""Payday Lender"" to meet its fiduciary responsibilities.\The M.J. coverage also eclipsed news in the world of state lotteries. There are currently 42 states that run lotteries. In my travels this past week I conducted in-depth interviews with more than two store clerks who are actually involved in selling lottery tickets.\Here are the shocking facts I unearthed:\The current recession has had little impact on the sale of beer and lottery tickets in the three states where my comprehensive study was conducted. Ironically, all three states have some pretty daunting budget issues, with California being one of them.\Maybe the state lotteries should begin issuing IOUs to their winners. We all know what happens to gamblers in Las Vegas that issue IOUs to cover their losses!\Concerning global warming: During the recent, round-the-clock M.J. coverage it was nearly impossible to get information concerning the plans of our enlightened politicians to solve the global warming dilemma.\It turns out that while Americans were being fed a steady diet of heart-warming M.J. stories, politicians have been using global warming as an excuse for implementing a policy referred to as ""Cap and Trade.""\If implemented, the government's plan would allow it to issue ""Emission Permits"" which authorize companies, corporations, and groups to emit X amount of pollutants.\If a particular entity exceeded their allotted emission of pollutants they would then have to buy emission credits from parties that are emitting less than their allotted amounts - costing them enormous amounts of money. (By applying the ""Trickle Down"" theory it's easy to see how it would cost us too!)\To understand how well Cap and Trade would work in cleaning up the environment, we simply have to envision a similar program that could be implemented by the department of motor vehicles. Try to imagine drivers being issued permits to have crashes - if they don't crash, they could sell their crash permits to people who have exceeded their personal crash quota.\Cap and Trade will be as effective in reducing pollution as it would be in making us safer drivers. Then again, what do I know, I'm the one who is convinced that the recent heat wave is being caused by global warming ... either that or it's July!"
28," Mike Leavitt says the Bush administration hasn't gotten as much credit as it deserves for its environmental stewardship. But he thinks that will change during the next four years -- and he believes there will be another four years.\ Leavitt, sworn in last year as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency after serving nearly three terms as Utah's governor, told The Salt Lake Tribune editorial board Thursday that the indicators -- primarily a shift in poll numbers following the Republican National Convention -- are now pointing to the president's re-election in November.\ If that occurs, Leavitt claims his agency is poised to make big strides -- erasing at least some of the criticisms of Bush's first- term environmental policies.\ ""We're talking about preventing pollution, as opposed to just cleaning it up,"" said Leavitt. ""I think what we'll see is the biggest decrease in air pollution in history. I think the stage is set for that.""\ Leavitt says he intends to sign the Clean Air Interstate Rule, aimed at reducing coal-fired power plant emissions by up to 70 percent through the ""cap and trade"" methods that EPA used to successfully reduce acid rain levels in the last decade.\ At $50 billion, ""this is the most expensive rule ever promulgated by the EPA,"" Leavitt said. ""Instead of traditional command-and- control, we can use a market approach to get that 70 percent decrease.""\ Leavitt is similarly upbeat about the administration's plan to reduce mercury levels nationwide, leaning heavily on developing technologies and turning mercury into a global issue. Leavitt says more than half of all mercury-related pollution in this country comes from overseas.\ But the Sierra Club earlier this year called the EPA's proposed mercury controls weak compared wit those in states such as Florida, saying ""the Bush administration has once again put the interests of corporate polluters ahead of America's public health.""\ In keeping with the administration's broader theme on the topic, Leavitt says the environment and marketplace are inextricably connected.\ ""We're competing in a world where the competition is global,"" he said. ""And many of our competitors don't hold the same environmental standards we do. . . . The question isn't whether we make environmental progress. It's how we can make environmental progress and have economic prosperity.""\ jbaird@sltrib.com"

And he has discovered legislation -- which he describes as a ""no regrets"" strategy -- that addresses these concerns.\So this year the soft-spoken Sugar House carpenter and ski patroller launched a Utah chapter of the national Citizens Climate Lobby.\""Building relationships, creating communication, talking as adults,"" he said, ""even if we disagree -- it's going to be way more effective than the alternative"" of bickering about carbon-dioxide emissions.\""The stakes,"" Barron said, ""are so high.""\Scientists have documented dozens of signs that greenhouse gases such as CO2 are disrupting global climate patterns.

Nonetheless, Schmidt said, the meetings were productive. ""They are listening more than people might think.""\Mark Reynolds, the group's national executive director based in San Diego, noted that historically it has taken time for many key movements to take hold.

Not long ago, a gallon of gasoline cost mroe than $3.80. It has now fallen to less than $2 in many areas. Few saw such a decline coming, but it creates an intriguing opportunity to take action on climate change as well as address transportation needs that depend heavily on gas taxes.
\
Despite the plummeting price of oil and gasoline, most elected officials are loath to raise the gas tax and invite public displeasure. Yet many also recognize the need to supplement falling revenues from current gas taxes and to reduce risks from climate change.
\
The current federal gas tax of 18.4 cents a gallon was set in 1993. Congress failed to index it to inflation, so revenue was destined to decline even as transportation maintenance needs grew. States gas taxes also are fairly low, averaging about 31 cents a gallon.
\
Revenues from gas taxes fell as people drove less and used more fuel-efficient vehicles. The high cost of gasoline encouraged these desirable trends, but that also meant less money for transportation infrastructure repairs.
\
Vehicle fuel efficiency is slated to increase more over the next decade, which is great news. Yet the change will further erode transportation revenue.
\
California's experience suggests what might be done. The state leads the nation in taking climate change seriously and in promoting alternatives to fossil fuels.
\
Burning those fuels in our cars, trucks, and planes is responsible for 28 percent of the country's greenhouse gas releases. Just recently, Governor Brown proposed striking new goals: cutting in half the state's use of fossil fuels in vehicles and in 15 years generating half of the state's electricity from renewable sources.
\
The component of California's policy that other states should consider is its cap-and-trade program that puts a price on use of carbon-based fuels. The state just extended it to transportation fuels. In effect, beginning on January 1 of this year, California raised its gas tax by an estimated 10 cents a gallon.
\
A carbon or greenhouse gas tax like this can be designed for different purposes. Government could add the tax to all fossil fuels, as California has done, thereby raising their price to reflect at least some of the social costs of using them, such as impacts on climate change, the environment and public health that gas prices do not now include.
\
Over time, the higher price should discourage use of fossil fuels, promote a search for alternatives and stimulate energy efficiency while also improving air quality and public health. Such a market-based policy might even appeal to political conservatives who prefer market solutions to government regulation.
\
Because the higher cost for energy can be a serious burden on many citizens, other taxes could be lowered by the same amount. That is, there need be no net increase in taxes, only a shift of taxes to carbon releases.
\
The Citizens Climate Lobby has proposed such a revenue-neutral carbon tax, which it calls a carbon fee and dividend system in which all the fees collected are returned to households as a dividend to help pay for the increased cost of fossil fuels.
\
One recent study found that the plan could reduce carbon emissions sharply, create millions of jobs, and greatly improve air quality and public health.
\
Variations on such a policy might hold even more appeal for some policymakers and the public. These include dedication of some portion of the fees to highways, mass transit, research on energy technologies or other policy goals.
\
Low gasoline prices will not last. If we're smart, we'll take advantage of current prices to build public support for increasing the gas tax and pegging it to inflation. Even better, states could enact revenue-neutral carbon taxes on all fossil fuels to help combat climate change. California shows that it can be done.

\
The most preposterous thing about a carbon tax, which California is in the process of implementing under the guise of a cap-and-trade program and which some other states are now considering, is the pretense that it will curb carbon emissions.
\
This notion - the idea that states can save the planet from getting too hot - is great soap opera, but it is just a way to bring more revenue to state governments regardless of its stated intent.
\
Whether it's called cap-and-trade or a carbon tax, California is now stuck with a fee on the carbon content of fuels. It's the first of its kind in the United States, but environmental groups are urging other states to do the same.
\
The California Air Resources Board, whose goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, claims the tax is a cost for oil refineries. But that's disingenuous.
\
Oil companies will simply pass the carbon tax along to California consumers in the form of higher prices. Experts estimate that the tax - which took effect at the start of this year - has the potential to increase gasoline prices by as much as 75 cents per gallon.
\
Guess who would pay the bill for the carbon tax? A carbon tax would disproportionately impact those who are most vulnerable in our economy - low-and-middle class families and small businesses. It would be foolish to think otherwise.
\
Make no mistake, the tax on transportation fuels will push gas and diesel prices upward and burden drivers, businesses, and schools, effectively erasing the economic benefits that Californians currently enjoy at the pump.
\
Think about its impact: To save money, some drivers may fill up at service stations in neighboring states that don't have a carbon tax.
\
And companies might be tempted to relocate elsewhere in the country to save on energy costs. Other companies might have no choice but to shut down, resulting in a loss of jobs. States without a carbon tax would gain economically at the expense of those with one.
\
In Vermont, a coalition of environmental groups has proposed a state tax of between $50 and $150 per ton of carbon emissions to be levied on businesses that distribute gasoline, heating oil, natural gas, propane and diesel. The groups claim the tax would produce $35 million in revenue by 2017 and as much as $700 million by 2030. Of the new revenues, 10 percent would automatically go to renewable energy companies.
\
State government is a great milieu for ""pass the buck"" politics, but carbon taxation is merely a way to reduce a staggering debt and reward political allies.
\
What someone like California Gov. Jerry Brown might not be able to achieve through tighter controls on spending, he can certainly gain by using public concern about climate change to ratchet up taxes. And you can be sure it won't stop at the gas pump.
\
The next target for carbon taxes could be electricity utilities and their customers. Environmentalists say it's no big deal. But fossil fuels account for about 60 percent of the nation's electricity supplies.
\
The irony is that the largest U.S. environmental groups oppose nuclear power, arguably the most important energy source in the battle against global warming.
\
The U.S. fleet of 100 nuclear plants accounts for nearly two-thirds of the nation's zero-carbon energy. But environmentalists don't recognize nuclear power's environmental value or its critically important role in maintaining a diverse mix of energy sources for reliable electricity.
\
To my mind, the path forward begins with environmentalists recognizing the importance of keeping existing nuclear plants in operation and realizing that nuclear power can collaborate well with other forms of emission-free energy such as solar and wind. If something better comes along, fine.
\
But carbon taxes should be the last resort - they won't help the environment much, they'll expand the size of government, and they'll damage the economy.

A green initiative to fight global warming signed by Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. on Monday is being heralded by environmentalists, but Utah industry leaders say the pact could hurt the state's economy and impede the implementation of clean coal technologies.
\
The Western Regional Climate Action Initiative calls for an overall regional goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from six Western states, including Utah, and calls for a cap and trade program whereby emission credits could be sold.
\
But the implementation of such a program could mean a hit in the pocketbook for Utah industries and consumers, who currently pay among the lowest prices nationally for electricity.
\
In fact, Utah residential electricity prices are about half of what California residents pay.
\
Utah Sen. Mike Dmitrich, D-Price, said if Utah implements laws regulating carbon dioxide emissions, electricity rates in the state will skyrocket.
\
""It really surprises me that Gov. Huntsman got in bed with California when they have had severe brownouts not that long ago and they are predicted again this year,"" Dmitrich said. ""We have to look at the many, many jobs that could be lost if something this drastic takes place. The income to the state and the economy from electric power generation and the coal industry is enormous.""
\
Huntsman has said the initiative does not mean coal-fired power plants will become a relic of the past. In addition, Huntsman is unwilling to say he opposes the building of new coal-fired power plants.
\
But in California a new law implemented this year bars utilities and cities from renewing or negotiating new contracts from high- polluting sources, like coal-fired power plants.
\
Major California cities -- like Anaheim, Burbank, Glendale, Pasadena and Riverside -- currently rely on Utah coal-fired power plants for their electricity needs. By 2027, those cities will no longer be allowed to purchase coal-fired power.
\
""We don't have such a thing as Democratic air or Democratic water or Republican air or Republican water,"" said California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger at a news conference Monday. ""Three and a half years ago when I campaigned to become governor I said I want to take care of the economy and take care of the environment. They said, 'You can't do both.' But we have proven that you can do both.""
\
Still, for Utah consumers, a cap and trade program could have tremendous economic impacts, according to Dave Eskelsen, a spokesman for Rocky Mountain Power, which serves 75 percent of the state's residents.
\
""A cap and trade program doesn't in and of itself reduce emissions. It makes emissions more expensive,"" Eskelsen said. ""We want to be part of these discussions to make sure that energy policy changes are well informed as to their impacts on consumers. Our experience has been that customers generally do not favor rate increases for any reason.""

32," We may not have succeeded in clearing the air about what standards will be expected of power plants and other factories that discharge their wastes into the sky. But we have apparently determined a new definition of the term ""environmental extremist.""\ That, according to the Republican chairman of the Senate Environment Committee, is anyone who worries more about the air in his children's lungs than the money in someone else's pockets.\ In blaming Wednesday's smothering of President Bush's so-called Clear Skies initiative on ""environmental extremists,"" Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe ignored the fact that about the only thing that would be made clearer by the proposed legislation is the right of industry to pollute our air without interference from the federal government, the states or individuals brazen enough to sue to protect their health.\ The core of the idea is the ""cap-and-trade"" approach, in which the government sets national limits for the amount of certain chemicals sent skyward. Rather than simply fine plants that don't meet standards, the system would encourage compliance by allowing plants that do reduce pollution to be rewarded by selling emission credits to plants that cannot or will not follow suit.\ The basic idea certainly has its good points. It could reduce overall air pollution by a significant amount, using the levels of the marketplace instead of the blunt instrument of government as its main tool.\ But, as reduced and distorted in the bill that was before the committee, Clear Skies was all hot air.\ It would include mercury in the list of chemicals that factories could pay to emit. That's a bad idea because mercury tends to settle near its place of origin and plants that kept emitting it would really poison their neighborhoods.\ It would handicap the ability of states to enforce their own limits. And that's a bad idea, according to Republican governors George Pataki of New York and Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, because states have a better handle on what they face and what to do.\ And it would do nothing to limit the amount of carbon dioxide sent into the air. Which is a really bad idea because that is a primary source of global climate change. That's a threat that seems to be taken seriously everywhere but in Washington, D.C., coincidentally one of the few places where people are given large sums of money to be blind to such facts.\ There must be some carrot-and-stick approaches that could help clean up our air. This bill, clearly, wasn't one of them."

Fervent. 1. Hot, burning, glowing, boiling. -- Oxford English Dictionary
\
WASHINGTON -- ""Fervently"" is how America will henceforth engage in talks on global warming. So said the president's climate change negotiator Sunday in Germany, at a U.N. conference on reducing carbon emissions. This vow was fervently applauded by conferees welcoming the end of what AP's news story called the Bush administration's ""eight years of obdurate participation"" in climate talks.
\
Reducing carbon emissions supposedly will reverse warming, if it resumes after the current period without warming, a period that began, according to statistics published by the World Meteorological Organization, 11 years ago. Regarding the reversing, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change has many ambitions, as outlined in a working group's 16-page ""information note"" to ""facilitate discussions."" For example:
\
""Tariffs can be lowered to grant special preference to climate-friendly goods, or they can be maintained at high levels to discourage trade in GHG (greenhouse gas)-intensive goods and services."" The working group says protectionism ""in the service of climate change objectives"" might virtuously ""shelter domestic producers of climate-friendly goods.""
\
Furthermore, using ""border carbon adjustment,"" a nation might virtuously ""impose costs on imports equivalent to that (sic) faced by domestic producers"" operating under a carbon tax. Or a nation with a cap-and-trade regime regulating carbon emissions by domestic manufacturers might require foreign manufacturers ""to buy offsets at the border equal to that (sic) which the producer would have been forced to purchase had the good been produced domestically.""
\
Cynics will see only potential for mischief by governments, including the U.S. government, using such measures to give a green patina to protectionism. Meanwhile, the U.S. government is having its own problems with one ""climate-friendly good"" that might not be. Last week The New York Times front page carried this headline: ""The Bulb That Saved the Planet May Be a Little Less Than Billed.""
\
The story recounted some Americans' misadventures with the new light bulbs that almost all Americans -- all but those who are filling their closets with supplies of today's incandescent bulbs -- will have to use after the phaseout of today's bulbs in 2014. (You missed that provision of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007?)
\
A San Francisco -- naturally -- couple emerged from Al Gore's movie ""An Inconvenient Truth"" incandescent with desire to think globally and act locally, in their home. So they replaced their incandescent bulbs with the compact fluorescents that Congress says must soon be ubiquitous. ""Instead of having a satisfying green moment, however,"" the Times reported, ""they wound up coping with a mess.""
\
Although supposed to last 10,000 hours and save, the Times says, ""as much as"" $5.40 a year in electricity costs, some bulbs died within a few hours. Some experts, reports the Times, ""blame the government for the quality problems,"" saying its push to cut the bulbs' prices prompted manufacturers to use inferior components.
\
Furthermore, some experts have written a guide saying the new bulbs require ""a little insight and planning."" The Times says that ""may be an understatement.""
\
The bulbs, says the Times, ""do not do well in hot places with little airflow, like recessed ceiling fixtures,"" and some do not work ""with dimmers or three-way sockets."" And: ""Be aware that compact fluorescents can take one to three minutes to reach full brightness. This is not a defect.""
\
Well, if you say so. Because all fluorescents contain mercury, a toxic metal, they must never be put in the trash, so Home Depot and other chains offer bins for disposing of dangerous bulbs. Driving to one of these disposal points might not entirely nullify the bulbs' environmental benefits. Besides, the Times summarizes the Environmental Protection Agency's helpful suggestions for coping with the environmental dangers caused when one of these environment-saving bulbs breaks:
\
""Clear people and pets from the room and open a window for at least 15 minutes if possible. Avoid vacuuming. Scoop up larger pieces with stiff paper or cardboard, pick up smaller residue with sticky tape, and wipe the area with a damp cloth. Put everything into a sealed plastic bag or sealed glass jar. In most cases, this can be put in the trash, but the EPA recommends checking local rules.""
\
Worrywarts wonder what will happen when a lazy or careless, say, 10 percent of 300 million Americans put their worn-out bulbs in the trash. Stop worrying. What do you think? That Congress, architect of the ethanol industry and designer of automobiles, does not think things through?

WASHINGTON -- Last week, a draft memo surfaced from the Homeland Security Department suggesting ways to administratively circumvent existing law to allow several categories of illegal immigrants to avoid deportation and, indeed, for some to be granted permanent residency. Most disturbing was the stated rationale. This was being proposed ""in the absence of Comprehensive Immigration Reform."" In other words, because Congress refuses to do what these bureaucrats would like to see done, they will legislate it themselves.
\
Regardless of your feelings on the substance of the immigration issue, this is not how a constitutional democracy should operate. Administrators administer the law, they don't change it. That's the legislators' job.
\
When questioned, the White House downplayed the toxic memo, leaving the impression that it was nothing more than ruminations emanating from the bowels of Homeland Security. But the administration is engaged in an even more significant power play elsewhere.
\
A 2007 Supreme Court ruling gave the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to regulate carbon emissions if it could demonstrate that they threaten human health and the environment. The Obama EPA made precisely that finding, thereby granting itself a huge expansion of power and, noted The Washington Post, sending ""a message to Congress.""
\
It was not a terribly subtle message: Enact cap-and-trade legislation -- taxing and heavily regulating carbon-based energy -- or the EPA will do so unilaterally. As Frank O'Donnell of Clean Air Watch noted, such a finding ""is likely to help light a fire under Congress to get moving.""
\
Well, Congress didn't. Despite the ""regulatory cudgel"" (to again quote the Post) the administration has been waving, the Senate has repeatedly refused to acquiesce.
\
Good for the Senate. But what to do when the executive is passively aggressive rather than actively so? Take border security. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., reports that President Barack Obama told him about pressure from his political left and its concern that if the border is secured, Republicans will have no incentive to support comprehensive reform (i.e., amnesty). Indeed, Homeland Security's abandonment of the ""virtual fence"" on the southern border, combined with its lack of interest in completing the real fence that today covers only one-third of the border, gives the distinct impression that serious border enforcement is not a high administration priority absent some Republican quid pro quo on comprehensive reform.
\
But border enforcement is not something to be manipulated in return for legislative favors. It is, as the administration vociferously argued in court in the Arizona case, the federal executive's constitutional responsibility. Its job is to faithfully execute the laws. Non-execution is a dereliction of duty.
\
This contagion of executive willfulness is not confined to the federal government or to Democrats. In Virginia, the Republican attorney general has just issued a ruling allowing police to ask about one's immigration status when stopped for some other reason (e.g., a traffic violation). Heretofore, police could inquire only upon arrest and imprisonment.
\
Whatever your views about the result, the process is suspect. If police latitude regarding the interrogation of possible illegal immigrants is to be expanded, that's an issue for the legislature, not the executive.
\
How did we get here? I blame Henry Paulson. (Such a versatile sentence.) The gold standard of executive overreach was achieved the day he summoned the heads of the country's nine largest banks and informed them that henceforth the federal government was their business partner. The banks were under no legal obligation to obey. But they know the capacity of the federal government, when crossed, to cause you trouble, endless trouble. They complied.
\
So did BP when the president summoned its top executives to the White House to demand a $20 billion federally administered escrow fund for damages. Existing law capped damages at $75 million. BP, like the banks, understood the power of the U.S. government. Twenty billion it was.
\
Again, you can be pleased with the result (I was), and still be troubled by how we got there. Everyone wants energy in the executive (as Alexander Hamilton called it). But not lawlessness. In the modern welfare state, government has the power to regulate your life. That's bad enough. But at least there is one restraint on this bloated power: the separation of powers. Such constraints on your life must first be approved by both houses of Congress.
\
That's called the consent of the governed. The constitutional order is meant to subject you to the will of the people's representatives, not to the whim of a chief executive or the imagination of a loophole-seeking bureaucrat.

Welcome to the world of dueling campaign rhetoric in the midst of today's tightly contested winner-take-all Florida Republican primary.
\
Voters hit the polls today to eventually award 57 Republican delegates as well as a first-place finish that could give the winner a boost the week before Super Duper Tuesday on Feb. 5. More than 20 states, including Utah, hold primary elections or caucuses for one or both major political parties that day.
\
It got ugly on the campaign trail Monday as Romney and McCain upped the rhetoric and their attacks on each other.
\
Romney used a sunrise press conference at a Texaco station in West Palm Beach as the backdrop for his continued criticism of McCain. His go-to example was the McCain-Lieberman climate change bill, which Romney says will increase gas and electricity prices to the tune of $1,000 per year for a Florida family of four.
\
""What's particularly troubling about the bill is that the effect on the global environment would be negligible,"" Romney said. ""The bill does not require other nations to participate.""
\
Romney said that missing requirement would merely force high- emitting industries to leave the United States to go to countries with lower requirements -- taking their jobs with them.
\
""As someone who has spent his life in business, I know how business people think, and they will follow the course of least resistance,"" Romney said. ""If we put a huge burden on our industries and homeowners, the industries will move to places where those burdens don't exist.""
\
Romney pounded home his point at airport hangar stops across the state -- that McCain-Lieberman and two other McCain-sponsored bills illustrate how he is the wrong choice for Florida and the nation.
\
""If somebody wants to know where he would lead the country they simply need to look at the three pieces of legislation with his name at the top,"" Romney said.
\
He told crowds that the McCain-Feingold law on campaign finance ""has not reduced the influence of money and politics, it's made it worse."" And he lambasted the McCain-Kennedy proposal on immigration as an ""amnesty bill.""
\
Romney said, ""All three are bills evidence a lack of understanding of our economy, the very lack of understanding that Sen. McCain has admitted on numerous occasions.""
\
McCain's campaign, also on the final-day stump, shot back quickly with a statement.
\
""Mitt Romney has proven in this campaign that he will say anything to anyone at anytime if he thinks it will help him politically. His stunning capacity to reverse his position on virtually every issue casts serious doubt on his ability to lead. Floridians need to ask themselves: If he changes his position today, what prevents him from reversing himself again tomorrow?"" according to a statement from McCain communications director Jill Hazelbaker. ""Today, desperate to attack John McCain in the heat of a political campaign, Mitt Romney has changed his position once again.""
\
McCain's campaign latched onto the ""flip-flopper"" tag often given to Romney, saying that two years ago he fully supported a ""cap and trade"" system to deal with global climate change. McCain's campaign quoted him as saying, ""I'm convinced it is good business,"" and said Romney cited its ""positive effect on development of technologies and economic growth.""
\
McCain also released a Web ad on YouTube called a ""Tale Of Two Mitts"" showing video clips from Romney's 1994 Senate race against Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and other video that appear to contradict statements made in 2007 while campaigning for the White House.
\
After a rally in Sanford, Fla., Monday afternoon, Al Cardenas, chairman of the Romney campaign in Florida, said the campaign received word from supporters that they were getting automated calls saying that Romney was in favor of opening relations with Fidel Castro in Cuba. The source of the calls was unknown.
\
Cardenas said it was a ""dirty tactic and strategy"" and while he did not outright say the McCain campaign was behind it, he said that only the Romney and McCain campaigns were doing automated calls in the state.
\
McCain spokeswoman Crystal Benton said the calls were not being made by the campaign. She said, though, that automated calls that say they were from the Romney campaign were inaccurately characterizing McCain's record on abortion. Benton said, noting McCain has a 24-year pro-life record.""
\
The back and forth between McCain and Romney lasted all day.
\
In a send-off rally at the West Palm Beach airport, Romney was back painting McCain as a liberal, pointing to the fact he one time considered being Sen. John Kerry's running mate on the Democratic ticket in 2004.
\
""Had someone asked me that question, there would not have been a nanosecond of thought about it; it would have been an immediate laugh,"" Romney said. ""And, of course, if someone asked him if he would consider me as a running mate, he would have also laughed immediately.""
\
During an airport stop at Fort Myers, Romney told a crowd of supporters that McCain has pressed for legislation that ""would have pulled the nation to the left. I just don't think those liberal answers are what America is looking for,"" Romney said.
\
Then it was the McCain campaign's turn to hang the liberal tag on Romney with senior policy adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin comparing Romney's health care plan he signed into law in Massachusetts as ""Hillary Clinton's health care plan.""
\
""At stake in the November election is a conservative Republican vision of low taxes, rapid job growth and families in charge of health care,"" Holtz-Eakin said. ""Governor Romney's record is the opposite: raising taxes, sluggish job growth and a Democrat's big government health plan. His record speaks louder than his words.""
\
Monday's skirmishes between McCain and Romney signify that Florida -- once thought to be former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani's state to lose -- has basically become a two-man race, each holding leads in recent polls.
\
Romney, who is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints, opened his press conference at the West Palm Beach gas station Monday ""on a personal note,"" talking about the death of LDS Church President Gordon B. Hinckley.
\
""Like millions of other members of my faith, I didn't get to know President Hinckley on a very personal one-to-one basis. Instead, I knew him as a member of my church and saw him as a leader of great capacity, of great ability to reach out and touch a large number of people with a very personal and human connection,"" Romney said. ""His humility and gentleness I think will always be a part of the memory that we have of President Gordon B. Hinckley.""
\
Romney said he met President Hinckley a few times during the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City to ask for help from the church for funding or access to property. He said he was impressed by President Hinckley's knowledge of the church's holdings.

\
Forget about the first 100 days of a president's term. Since Franklin Roosevelt established that artificial benchmark in 1933, newly elected presidents have accomplished more in their second 100 days than in their first.
\
Dwight Eisenhower signed the armistice ending the Korean War on July 27, 1953. Ronald Reagan steered his landmark 25 percent across-the-board tax cuts through Congress on Aug. 4, 1981, and George W. Bush gained passage of his signature $1.35 trillion tax cut on May 26, 2001.
\
It takes time for a president to put his team in place, formulate policies, steer legislation through Congress and conduct foreign negotiations. President Barack Obama accomplished much in his first 100 days.
\
He won congressional approval of his budget and a $787 billion stimulus bill, and he changed policy on stem cell research, abortion, the environment, labor rights and national security through executive orders.
\
Obama will be more sternly tested in his second 100 days, when Congress considers proposals for overhauling financial regulations, fixing the health-care system and controlling global warming, arguably humanity's greatest challenge. He will face intense opposition from interest groups and cannot presume unified Democratic support or cooperation from Republicans.
\
Obama will not enact his full agenda during his second 100 days, but he needs to make significant progress. In foreign policy he needs to show results from controlling nuclear arms, negotiating with Iran and expanding a dubious war in Afghanistan that could become his Vietnam. Check in again on Aug. 6.

\
The next 100 days may be even more critical and productive as the president's legacy on health-care reform is likely to be written. Unfortunately, working legislative days will be limited, and the list of demands for his attention will continue to grow. But health-care reform will happen only if the president is directly, personally and wholeheartedly active in this effort. It is critical that he bring stakeholders to the table and keep pressure on everyone, including all members of Congress, to work together. He must cajole, educate, persuade and negotiate. Only he can engage the entire country in this fight.

\
Much of what will occupy President Obama's time during his second 100 days is unpredictable. But the banking crisis will soon grab the headlines again. On May 4, Day 105 of the Obama presidency, America will learn the ""stress test"" results for 19 top banks. With that announcement, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and, by implication, Obama will start tiptoeing through financial and political minefields.
\
Up to now, Treasury has been vague about what happens next, other than saying that public capital will be provided as necessary. As necessary? Hazards abound. If the authorities announce very small capital needs, markets may scream ""whitewash,"" conclude the government has lost touch with reality and panic.
\
But if regulators announce huge capital needs, markets may conclude the problem is worse than they thought, see the needs as overwhelming the Troubled Assets Relief Program and panic. Even if the Treasury and the Fed somehow thread the needle, the bank-by-bank specifics are likely to roil markets. And did I mention that getting Congress to vote more money for bank ""bailouts"" won't be easy?
\
Which brings me to a tremulous prediction: that sometime within the second 100 days, Geithner will return to Congress asking for precisely that.

\
President Obama should soon begin to translate into tactics and strategy his ongoing conceptual revolution of U.S. foreign policy.
\
Through his statements Obama has started to redefine the basic concepts that guide U.S. foreign policy. But to change actual policies he will have to make specific decisions, with the assistance of his top foreign policy team, regarding how to proceed, at what pace, how to overcome various obstacles and with what sense of urgency to act.
\
He will also have to deal with maneuvers from the secondary levels of his administration and from Congress to water down his goals and slow his efforts. The usual arguments that ""the time is not ripe"" for this or that will be raised; efforts will be made to attach conditions and time limits on the negotiations he favors to make certain that the negotiations remain fruitless; congressional resolutions to restrict his freedom of action will burst forth. And so on.
\
That is when President Obama, still commanding high popular support, will have to demonstrate why he was elected.
\
I think he will.

\
President Obama's election sent a powerful message about the openness of American society, and his eloquence can do a lot to improve the way the world views the United States. His travels in his first 100 days have further enhanced his popularity abroad.
\
Now he should use that popularity and eloquence to address some fundamental foreign policy challenges.
\
The president should use his popularity to convince our European allies that Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons and support for terrorism are truly dangerous. He should use his eloquence to explain to the people of Pakistan that our policies there advance common interests, not just our own. He should reassure the people of India that we have not forgotten India's importance as the world's largest democracy. He can speak up forcefully for the rights of women and advance the cause of freedom.
\
And by explaining clearly to the American people the need to sustain the burden of long-term commitments to protect our fundamental interests, he can build the confidence of those whose help we need but who may doubt America's staying power.

\
Many presidents quickly lose their sense of political direction.
\
The distractible Bill Clinton got derailed by the explosive issue of gays in the military, which savvy conservatives threw in his way early on.
\
Likewise, Jimmy Carter lost hold of party unity while micromanaging the White House tennis court schedules.
\
What are the potential distractions out there now? Although questions about torture prosecutions are in the news, the quagmire of Afghanistan and the dangers in Pakistan are more likely to give Obama what Lyndon Johnson got -- a foreign mess to ruin even the best domestic agenda.
\
Moreover, presidential focus can be especially difficult during hard economic times, which tend to bring out unruly and irrational forces. Think of how Roosevelt had to face down demagogue Huey Long, pitchfork anarchists and would-be anti-government conspirators.
\
But Obama brings to the job a fierce determination unequaled in recent presidential history. He plans to fight hard to win universal health care, clean energy and education reform. And, so far, he is undaunted.

\
Over the next 100 days the ownership of our problems will begin to pass to Obama, and the biggest challenge will be reconciling the president's leftist agenda with our economic realities.
\
Obama says he didn't create our problems, but that doesn't mean he won't pay a price when things get worse. Cap-and-trade that will increase power bills, taxes that will increase gasoline costs, health-care plans that will produce shortages and increase costs -- in the best of times these plans would depress manufacturing, cost jobs and increase the deficit.
\
Already, even his most ardent defenders blushed at his demand to cut $100 million from his $3.5 trillion budget.
\
We can really cut the budget by reducing the number of government employees and by limiting entitlements. Does anyone think Obama will do either?
\
We could grow our way out of the deficit if we had a few years of 4 percent GDP growth. Does Obama have a pro-growth plan? Does he even want it to happen?

As cap-and-trade advocates tie their knickers in knots over so-called ""global warming,"" Mother Nature refuses to cooperate. Earth's temperatures continue a chill that began 11 years ago. As global cooling accelerates, global-warmists kick, scream and push their pet theory -- just like little kids who cover their ears and stomp their feet when older children tell them not to bother waiting up for Santa Claus on Christmas Eve.
\
Consider how the globe cooled last month:
\
June in Manhattan averaged 67.5 degrees Fahrenheit, 3.7 degrees below normal -- the coldest average since 1958. The National Weather Service stated July 1: ""The last time that Central Park hit 85 in May ... but not in June was back in 1903.""
\
In Phoenix, June's high temperatures were below 100 degrees for 15 days straight, the first such June since 1913. In California's desert, Yucca Valley's June average was 83.5, 8.5 degrees below normal. Downtown Los Angeles averaged 74.5 degrees, five below normal.
\
Boston saw temperatures 4.7 degrees below normal. ""This is the second coldest average high temp since 1872,"" veteran meteorologist and Weather Channel alumnus Joseph D'Aleo reports at Icecap.com. ""It has been so cool and so cloudy that trees in northern New England are starting to show colors that normally first appear in September."" Looking abroad, D'Aleo noted: ""Southern Brazil had one of the coldest Junes in decades, and New Zealand has had unusual cold and snow again this year.""
\
New Zealand's National Climate Centre issued a June 2 press release headlined, ""Temperature: Lowest Ever for May for Many Areas, Colder Than Normal for All.""
\
South African officials say cold weather killed two vagrants in the Eastern Cape. Both slept outdoors June 26 and froze to death.
\
Simmer down, global-warmists retort. These are mere anecdotes, hand-picked to make them look silly.
\
Well, one would be foolish to challenge space-born satellites that gauge Earth's mean temperatures -- cold, hot and average. Here again, evidence of global cooling accumulates like snow drifts.
\
""There has been no significant global warming since 1995, no warming since 1998, and global cooling for the past few years,"" former U.S. Senate Environment Committee spokesman Marc Morano writes at ClimateDepot.com. Citing metrics gathered by Dr. Roy Spencer of the University of Alabama, Huntsville, Morano adds: ""The latest global averaged satellite temperature data for June 2009 reveal yet another drop in Earth's temperature ... Despite his dire warnings, the Earth has cooled 0.74 degrees F since former Vice President Al Gore released 'An Inconvenient Truth' in 2006.""
\
Earth's temperatures fall even as the planet spins within what global-warmists consider a thickening cloud of toxic carbon dioxide.
\
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth System Research Laboratory at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, consistently and reliably has measured CO2 for the last 50 years. CO2 concentrations have risen steadily for a half-century.
\
For December 1958, the Laboratory reported an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 314.67 parts per million. Flash forward to December 1998, about when global cooling reappeared. CO2 already had increased to 366.87 ppm. By December 2008, CO2 had advanced to 385.54 ppm, a significant 5.088 percent growth in one decade.
\
This capsizes the carbon-phobic global-warmist argument. For Earth's temperatures to sink while CO2 rises contradicts global warming as thoroughly as learning that firefighters can battle blazes by spraying them with gasoline.
\
So, to defeat so-called ""global warming,"" there is no need for the $864 billion Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill, the Kyoto Protocols, elaborate new regulations or United Nations guidelines. Instead, let the cold times roll.
\
It is one thing to have a national debate about a serious problem, with adults differing over which solution might work best. Reasonable people, for instance, can dispute whether growing federal involvement would heal or inflame our health-care system's serious maladies.
\
But as so-called global warming proves fictional, those who would shackle the economy with taxes and regulations to fight mythology increasingly resemble deinstitutionalized derelicts on an urban street corner, wildly swatting at their own imaginary monsters.

38,"Washington -\Salt Lake City Mayor Ralph Becker joined several environmental leaders in the nation's capital Wednesday to urge Congress to pass sweeping climate change legislation by Earth Day in April.\""There is now more to do than ever,"" Becker said at a news conference at the National Press Club with the founder of the original Earth Day celebration in 1970.\Becker, who has pushed to make Utah's capital city more eco-friendly, said that local officials, from mayors to counties, across the United States have worked to turn their communities green but that the federal government needs to step up and pass climate change legislation.\""We're not going to do this alone,"" said Becker, who was in Washington for a U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting. ""We need federal partners.""\The House passed the so-called cap-and-trade legislation last year that would put a limit on how much a company can pollute but allow businesses to buy credits to pollute more, a move aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions. The Senate has yet to act.\Becker, together with Earth Day founder Denis Hayes and officials from the National Wildlife Federation, Greenpeace USA and the Earth Day Network, pressed that the Senate should act by April 22 to pass the House version of cap-and-trade bill and then adjourn on that day to celebrate.\""We are at the beginning of a new revolution,"" said Kathleen Rogers, president of the Earth Day Network, which lobbies on behalf of a sustainable environment. Rogers said that like the industrial revolution, the green revolution could allow the United States to lead out on conservation.\""We can't really wait any longer,"" Rogers said.\Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, however, said in a recent op-ed that proponents of cap-and-trade legislation are trying to pitch their effort as the ""equivalent of a giant magic job Pez dispenser,"" when it would kill jobs.\Bishop, who voted against the bill, wrote in the new online news outlet Daily Caller that the Democrats' legislation would raise the price of gasoline, electricity, food and destroy millions of jobs and prolong the recession, all for a 0.22-degree temperature drop at the end of the century. He proposed allowing individual states to decide their own path forward.\""If cap-and-trade is the Shangri-La supporters think it will be, let it be proven and other states will follow,"" Bishop said in the editorial. ""Likewise, if it doesn't work, other states can learn from its failure and avoid the same mistakes.""\tburr@sltrib.com\Credit: by Thomas Burr The Salt Lake Tribune"
39,"Washington -\The fate of President Barack Obama's landmark climate change proposal rests largely in the hands of moderate Democrats, including Utah Rep. Jim Matheson.\And that has not gone unnoticed by miners, oil companies, environmentalists and an assortment of political operatives.\Matheson, a former energy consultant, has been the target of a big money media campaign including online, newspaper, radio and TV ads pushing him to either support or reject the president's plan to set a limit on pollution and spur the development of renewable energy.\What makes this high profile lobbying unusual is that it's focused on a committee debate, which is only the first in a long series of votes before the full House would even consider the bill.\""It's an interesting dynamic to see how many folks have taken a position on this bill before it has actually been written,"" said Matheson, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\Committee Chairman Henry Waxman released details of the so-called ""cap and trade"" proposal late last week in a 932-page bill, and plans to call for a vote on it this Friday. But first, the committee will try to work through hundreds of proposed amendments.\The legislation would set a nationwide cap on pollution and sell or give away allowances to emit greenhouse gas. Companies that pollute less can sell their allowances to companies that need more, creating a pollution market. Over the years, the cap on pollution would drop, spurring industries to find ways to lower their emissions.\All 23 of the committee's Republicans are expected to vote against the bill, which they argue will harm businesses and create a new ""tax"" on consumers. About the same number of Democrats have announced their support, saying the bill will help wean the nation off of foreign oil and help the environment.\That leaves a small number of moderate Democrats who remain on the fence.\These moderates ""Are like the political fulcrum of the committee,"" said Scott Segal, a Washington, D.C. lawyer representing utilities and refineries in the ongoing cap-and-trade negotiations.\""Without a full airing of what the moderate Democrats are interested in, it would be literally impossible for Chairman Waxman to produce a bill,"" he said.\And Matheson is more influential than most, Segal said, because he is the chairman of the Blue Dog energy task force, a conservative Democratic caucus. Hence the ad campaign.\The pro cap-and-trade group Alliance for Climate Protection is one of the groups that produced ads targeting Matheson, because of his swing vote status.\In one-minute radio spots that appeared in the last few weeks, the group says the nation must make a choice: ""try our luck with business as usual or invest in a clean energy future."" The ad then urges listeners to call Matheson's D.C. office.\""Rep. Matheson is certainly a key undecided vote and an influential voice among moderate democrats,"" said the Alliance's Keven Kennedy. ""We just hope to convince him of the great positive impact the creation of a clean energy economy will have on his district.""\The congressman calls all the attention this early in the legislative process ""pretty unique"" but it hasn't pushed him to make up his mind any faster.\He says the philosophy behind a cap-and-trade system could work, but he's worried his fellow Democrats are moving too fast on a complicated program.\Matheson's also concerned the legislation could harm certain areas of the country more than others, including Utah, which relies on coal for much of its own electricity and to export outside the state. And he doesn't want the proposals to increase people's utility bills too much, the major complaint raised by Republicans.\""I still have concerns with the bill,"" Matheson said. ""There's a lot to work through.""\mcanham@sltrib.com\Credit: by Matt Canham The Salt Lake Tribune"

WASHINGTON -- A year ago, then-Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt packed his bags for Washington, promising the nation's air and water would be cleaner under his stewardship as the newly appointed administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
\
But after a year of on-the-job schooling, Leavitt is finding out the grades others give his performance aren't nearly as good as the ones he gives himself.
\
On Thursday, the Property and Environmental Research Center (PERC), based in Bozeman, Mont., issued a 2004 report card on the Bush administration's environmental policies and gave the administration's approach to air quality -- which falls under Leavitt's domain -- an F grade.
\
Drinking water garnered a C-plus, Superfund and brownfields a C- minus, and water quality a B. Overall, the administration earned a C- plus grade on the environment.
\
The group, which encourages environmental policy based on free- market incentives and creative solutions rather than regulatory mandates, gave the lackluster grades for entirely different reasons than did another recent study.
\
That study by the Center for American Progress and OMB Watch thrashed the Bush administration -- and Leavitt in particular -- in its own report, asserting that industry special interests have been given carte blanche to rewrite air pollution regulations to the detriment of public health.
\
The study points out the Bush plan, called Clear Skies, would allow ""three times more toxic mercury, 50 percent more sulfur and hundreds of thousands more tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxides.""
\
According to another study by OMB Watch, the EPA ""has continued its record of doing little for the environment"" and that ""what little it has done in this time shows a pattern of placing corporate interests over the public interest.""
\
The study found the EPA had failed to achieve 73 percent of its ""benchmarks"" for cleaning up the environment that the agency announced in December 2003, just after Leavitt took office.
\
Both report cards stand in contrast to a recent report by EPA that boasted that total emissions of the six principal pollutants identified in the Clean Air Act dropped again in 2003, ""signaling that America's air is the cleanest ever in three decades.""
\
""Thanks to this progress, today's air is the cleanest most Americans have ever breathed,"" Leavitt said. ""Now, EPA is taking up the challenge to accelerate the pace of that progress into the future.""
\
How can Leavitt make a claim of ""substantial improvement"" when groups on all sides are taking shots at what his agency isn't doing?
\
Leavitt's claim is based on measuring results from when the Clean Air Act was first implemented in 1970, and from the implementation of a new acid rain program that went into effect in 1990. Improvement in recent years has been slow, and even Leavitt admits that the dramatic reductions seen after 1970 and 1990 are likely not in the forecast.
\
""Cleaning the air gets more difficult as the maximum benefits from existing rules are achieved and the low-hanging fruit is gone,"" Leavitt said. ""The sharp cuts of the early years of the acid rain program are behind us now, and it's time to take the next step to protect people's health.""
\
The next step, Leavitt says, is the Clean Air Interstate Rule, which would use the same cap-and-trade approach as the acid rain program. It would create financial incentives for electrical utilities to look for new low-cost ways to reduce emissions.
\
Leavitt predicts dramatic reductions akin to the acid rain program if implemented.
\
Cap-and-trade is a process where industry is given a capped number of ""credits"" -- in effect, an amount of pollution companies are allowed to emit legally -- that can then be traded with other companies.
\
That approach, the OMB Watch report states, means that ""some companies will be allowed to pollute more than others . . . , and the communities sited near them will be subjected to more intense levels of emissions than others.""
\
And in areas where companies choose to buy up pollution credits rather than install new pollution controls, air quality could actually diminish, even though regional air quality improves, it charges.
\
The PERC report takes Leavitt to task for his three-pronged approach to meeting federal ozone standards, which includes (1) mandatory automobile inspection and maintenance programs, (2) reducing pollution before new sources would be permitted, and (3) making certain transportation plans are consistent with air quality plans, in effect reducing how much people drive.
\
The report found that auto inspections ""are relatively ineffective"" and they ""waste money by testing mainly clean cars."" Yet the EPA has fought programs that identify the cars on the road that pollute the most, it said.
\
Leavitt's approach on new pollution sources is too costly and creates ""perverse incentives"" in the marketplace, the study found.
\
The third Leavitt approach, the study found, is doomed to fail because it requires spending thousands of dollars per capita to reduce auto use by only a few percentage points.
\
""Furthermore, such efforts are poorly targeted since only a few percent of cars contribute most of the pollution, but conformity targets everyone,"" the study reported. ""Technology has proven to be far more effective for dealing with air pollution.""

41,"Bill Townsend is a brainy, easy-speaking former Louisianan and oilman who founded a couple of companies and spent 16 years in the energy business before migrating to Utah about 20 years ago.\Partner Greg Spencer grew up in the Midwest and came to Salt Lake City in the 1970s to study geography and to ski. He eventually became a lawyer, working for American Stores. In 1999, he helped sell the Salt Lake City-based grocery chain to rival Albertsons Inc. in an $8.7 billion deal.\The two are evangelical Christians who met at a Bible study class just a stone's throw from where the carbon trading company they later founded is located, in the Cottonwood Corporate Center in Holladay.\Townsend, 55, and Spencer, 52, are self-styled environmental capitalists. Others have called them Christian capitalists and carbon entrepreneurs. Whatever they're called, their company, Blue Source LLC, is at the vortex of a growing, but controversial, voluntary carbon emissions offset sector advocated by strategies that serve as one of the cornerstones of the Obama administration's energy policy..\Proponents, such as Townsend and Spencer, claim carbon trading has the potential to cleanse millions of cubic tons of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, while providing a bridge from a carbon-based economy to a future where energy comes from hydrogen fuel cells, solar, wind or some other technology yet to be discovered.\Critics contend that carbon trading simply pushes pollution from one place to another, and that although strides have been made, the market-based technique for controlling global warming hasn't lived up to promises.\""The way we would judge the voluntary program is whether it has successfully reduced emissions to a level where the problem is going away or under control. The voluntary approach has not succeeded in doing that,"" said John Coequyt, senior Washington representative for The Sierra Club.\--\Market emerges - A carbon market has emerged in the United States, even though Congress has not enacted caps on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Polluting companies buy offset credits, a financial derivative generated from emissions reduction, principally to get ahead of regulations they expect Congress will eventually impose.\Globally, the market for trading emissions reductions is expected to reach close to $670 billion in 2013, according to SBI Reports, a market research firm. The U.S. market could be about $100 billion.\An energy bill introduced last month by Democrats Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, could spur domestic carbon trading further. It would establish a market-based program to reduce global warming pollution, possibly modeled on the strategy Blue Source developed.\The Waxman-Markey bill has pushed the intensely private Townsend and Spencer into the limelight. Representatives from several states have contacted the pair, hoping to learn from their experience. Since 2001, Blue Source has amassed 300 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission offsets, said to be the country's largest collection of credits that can be bought and sold with the aim of reducing global warming.\The company has projects in 45 states and three Canadian provinces, including efforts to capture methane from landfills and bury carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants. In Colorado, Blue Source developed a project to pipe carbon dioxide from a natural gas processing plant in Colorado to a line that, in turn, pumps it into an aging oil field in Texas. Blue Source expects the CO2 reduction to be equivalent to taking 70,000 cars off the road.\""So many times when we would visit with CEOs and chief financial officers, there was a cultural mind-set in this country that you could not do something that was good for the environment and good for the bottom line at the same time.

There the CO2 was injected into mature oil fields to sweep more crude toward otherwise depleted wells.\The experience gave Townsend an insight. A carbon offset market was developing in North America, spurred by growing certainty that greenhouse gas emissions eventually would be regulated. With that in mind, Petro Source approached Ontario Power Generating Inc., a Canadian utility that produces electricity with coal-fired plants. After a year, Ontario Power agreed to buy 1 million tons of offsets from the west Texas project.\Townsend was living in Salt Lake City.

Ontario Power, one of the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide in Canada, knew Blue Source was buying large volumes of carbon credits from CO2 producers that had developed methods of cutting their gas emissions, Spencer said.\Ontario Power struck a five-year deal with Blue Source, agreeing to buy credits worth 9 million tons of carbon dioxide. The agreement allowed Ontario Power to meet its voluntary commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without building expensive stack scrubbers.\The transaction was ""the largest publicly announced firm purchase of 'carbon dioxide equivalent' in the history of the global greenhouse gas market,"" according to Co2e.com, which helped arrange the deal.\Since then, Blue Source has clinched contracts with clients in several industries, including grocery giant Albertsons, Tyson Foods, trucking company J.B.

At two landfills, in Nebraska and Maryland, Blue Source has built systems to capture and burn off methane, a greenhouse gas with 21 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. Capture systems at the other landfills belong to the owners.\""Then we create the carbon credits that are associated with the capture system,"" said Annika Colston, a Blue Source vice president. ""They are highly marketable.""\Money to finance Blue Source has been rolling in. In 2006, First Reserve Corp., a private-equity investor, bought a 50 percent stake in the company.

It also purchased a piece of Blue Source.\And in November investment bank Goldman Sachs acquired an equity stake, while also promising to market Blue Source offset credits to its clients.\""We have a long tradition of working with our clients to help them hedge risks associated with various commodities,"" said Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally.\""As European, and now U.S. regulators, adopt regulations addressing climate change and creating markets for carbon, we are developing new products to add this new commodity risk to our clients.

42,"Bill Townsend is a brainy, easy-speaking former Louisianan and oilman who founded a couple of companies and spent 16 years in the energy business before migrating to Utah about 20 years ago.\Partner Greg Spencer grew up in the Midwest and came to Salt Lake City in the 1970s to study geography and to ski. He eventually became a lawyer, working for American Stores. In 1999, he helped sell the Salt Lake City-based grocery chain to rival Albertsons Inc. in an $8.7 billion deal.\The two are evangelical Christians who met at a Bible study class just a stone's throw from where the carbon trading company they later founded is located, in the Cottonwood Corporate Center in Holladay.\Townsend, 55, and Spencer, 52, are self-styled environmental capitalists. Others have called them Christian capitalists and carbon entrepreneurs. Whatever they're called, their company, Blue Source LLC, is at the vortex of a growing, but controversial, voluntary carbon emissions offset sector advocated by strategies that serve as one of the cornerstones of the Obama administration's energy policy..\Proponents, such as Townsend and Spencer, claim carbon trading has the potential to cleanse millions of cubic tons of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, while providing a bridge from a carbon-based economy to a future where energy comes from hydrogen fuel cells, solar, wind or some other technology yet to be discovered.\Critics contend that carbon trading simply pushes pollution from one place to another, and that although strides have been made, the market-based technique for controlling global warming hasn't lived up to promises.\""The way we would judge the voluntary program is whether it has successfully reduced emissions to a level where the problem is going away or under control. The voluntary approach has not succeeded in doing that,"" said John Coequyt, senior Washington representative for The Sierra Club.\--\Market emerges - A carbon market has emerged in the United States, even though Congress has not enacted caps on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Polluting companies buy offset credits, a financial derivative generated from emissions reduction, principally to get ahead of regulations they expect Congress will eventually impose.\Globally, the market for trading emissions reductions is expected to reach close to $670 billion in 2013, according to SBI Reports, a market research firm. The U.S. market could be about $100 billion.\An energy bill introduced last month by Democrats Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, could spur domestic carbon trading further. It would establish a market-based program to reduce global warming pollution, possibly modeled on the strategy Blue Source developed.\The Waxman-Markey bill has pushed the intensely private Townsend and Spencer into the limelight. Representatives from several states have contacted the pair, hoping to learn from their experience. Since 2001, Blue Source has amassed 300 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission offsets, said to be the country's largest collection of credits that can be bought and sold with the aim of reducing global warming.\The company has projects in 45 states and three Canadian provinces, including efforts to capture methane from landfills and bury carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants. In Colorado, Blue Source developed a project to pipe carbon dioxide from a natural gas processing plant in Colorado to a line that, in turn, pumps it into an aging oil field in Texas.

I enjoyed the article ""Gore and LDS leaders meet."" The article noted how Gore speaks of three crises facing the country: the environment, economics and security. The solution is not ""cap and trade"" but protective vigilance, thorough preparation and wise conservation of resources, which protect the planet, while not impairing the productive fields of human endeavor.

44,"Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. announced today that Utah will help create a regional program aimed at reducing the West's greenhouse-gas emissions.\The carbon cap-and-trade proposal, conducted through the Western Climate Initiative, is part of a push to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 15 percent by 2020. It would be phased in over several years and proponents say that, in addition to reducing emissions, it would ease dependence on fossil fuels and spawn new ""green"" industries.\The group, which includes seven Western states and four Canadian provinces, unveiled its recommendations for implementing the cap-and-trade program this morning.\""Today's plan is just the beginning of extensive discussions that will continue with our Legislature and stakeholders to ensure the design works for Utah,"" said Dianne Nielson, Huntsman's energy adviser. ""We will also continue to review economic analyses to ensure the recommendations provide cost-effective results.""\But some state lawmakers worry that the initiative could hinder the state's already laboring economy.\""We want to protect the environment. We want to protect the air quality and do all those things ... but we want to make sure that the coal industry and some of these that are important economic drivers for our state"" are not harmed, said House Speaker Greg Curtis, R-Sandy, who received a short briefing on the program Monday.\The Western Climate Initiative program will use emissions from 2010 as a baseline. Beginning in 2012, each partner will be granted emission ""allowances"" that will move the state to the WCI's goal - a 15 percent reduction by 2020. It then will be up to each partner to decide how to distribute its allowance. They could be given away or auctioned to industries that produce carbon emissions.\Emissions would be rigorously monitored. If an company or entity doesn't have enough allowances to cover its emissions, it could lose some of its discharge allowances as a penalty, forcing it either to buy more credits or cut its emissions.\When Huntsman enlisted the state in the Western Climate Initiative in 2007, some lawmakers were irritated that they weren't consulted first. A bill aimed at limiting the governor's power to enter into such agreements in the future passed the Legislature by an overwhelming margin last session, but Huntsman vetoed it and agreed to brief legislative leaders before he commits the state to future partnerships.\Curtis said lawmakers want to know more about the cap-and-trade plan.\""I don't feel like we've been deeply consulted,"" said Curtis, who had a planned meeting on the proposal with the governor Monday, but it was replaced with discussion of the state's $272 million budget shortfall. ""If the Western Climate Initiative wants to announce they're going in a direction, more power to them. We just want to make sure we're not getting co-opted into something.""\gehrke@sltrib.com\Credit: Robert Gehrke The Salt Lake Tribune"
45,"The United States and the United Kingdom have battled great challenges together over the years. Now we must do so again, against the greatest challenge of all: delivering a healthy and prosperous future for our children and grandchildren.\Beginning Sunday, the Western Governors Association is meeting in Park City to take on some of the hardest issues of our time: climate change, future energy supply and water scarcity. The UK is honored to be participating in the WGA meeting and we look forward to working further with the U.S. so that our children may inherit a world that their health and their pocketbooks can afford.\In a global recession, some argue that our economies cannot afford action to reduce the impact of emissions on the environment. The opposite is true. First, action on the environment does not damage economic growth. UK emissions have declined 16 percent since 1990 while the economy has grown by over 40 percent.\Secondly, there really is no choice between helping the economy or helping the environment. They go together. To rebuild our economies for the long term we must have sustainable energy sources and more efficient energy use.\Fortunately, for you in the United States and for us in Europe, our countries are well placed to build great new companies and create millions of new jobs in a low-carbon world. History shows us that the countries who adjust first to new energy technologies become the economic winners of the new era. We saw this when Britain was first to exploit the potential of coal, and then again when the United States was first to embrace the age of oil. Governments and business should work together now to ensure that we are once again ahead of the curve.\The British government offers a number of sustainable energy incentives, to encourage, for example, energy-efficient buildings and low-carbon vehicles. Several American companies are taking advantage of these incentives. We are delighted to welcome them and help them succeed in the UK. What is good for their bottom line is good for our energy and climate security.\Because it makes such compelling economic sense, this should not be a matter of political ideology. In Britain, and throughout Europe, there is consensus on climate action across the political divide. The 27 countries of the European Union have established a greenhouse gas cap and trade program, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.\Launched in 2005, it is the largest multinational emissions trading system in the world. By putting a price on carbon, the ETS encourages industry to use less of it, thereby cutting our energy imports among other advantages; and at the same time it incentivizes businesses to adopt new energy technologies, thereby helping the companies offering those new technologies.\The ETS is still young but we can already see that it is working. Participating companies are finding that energy efficiency means cost savings. Our hope is that the success of the ETS can and will prompt global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.\The scientific evidence for man-made climate change is overwhelming. We owe it to future generations to act now to give them a viable future. And those few who may still doubt the science should ask themselves whether they really want to remain hostage to spiking oil prices, and whether they really want to take the risk of handing their descendants a toxic legacy, toxic in terms of both health and economic consequences, when there is absolutely no need to do so.\We have the means to avoid that risk. We just need the will. All of us.\Bob Peirce has been British Consul-General in Los Angeles since June 2005.\Credit: By Bob Peirce"
46,"The following editorial appeared in Thursday's Washington Post:\So the climate talks at the Group of Eight summit in L'Aquila, Italy, with the world's 17 major greenhouse gas emitters didn't go as planned. Unrest back home forced Chinese President Hu Jintao to leave before he could get down to negotiating with an engaged American president.\Developing nations balked at committing to long-term emissions reductions goals because industrialized countries balked at setting short-term targets. And they were none too pleased that rich nations wouldn't make a firm commitment to help them deal with the effects of climate change. All this spells disaster if you have a glass-half-empty worldview.\But take a look at what was accomplished. All of the nations agreed that the Earth's average temperature should not rise more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels. The eight leading industrial nations agreed to slash their greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050. This is an improvement over the 50 percent reduction that the G-8 agreed to last year and now puts the industrialized world in sync with what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says is needed to halt the catastrophic consequences of climate change. President Obama played an active role in getting this done, quite a change from the foot-dragging and denial that characterized U.S. climate change policy under President George W. Bush.\That's not to say that all's smooth sailing to the big climate treaty talks in Copenhagen in December. In addition to the big hurdles mentioned above, the baseline year is fluid -- based on emission levels ""compared to 1990 or more recent years."" Many European countries wanted reductions based on 1990 levels. The recently passed American Clean Energy and Recovery Act (a.k.a. Waxman-Markey) is pegged to 2005 levels. And thus our attention moves from the hobbled progress abroad to the chaotic road to consensus at home on climate change legislation that Obama can take to Denmark.\Even with all the compromises, directives, subsidies and other giveaways hurled at members to secure their votes, Waxman-Markey barely made it out of the House last month. It calls for a 17 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 below 2005 levels. It would also give away 85 percent of the pollution credits in the initial years of a complicated cap-and-trade system that would put a price on carbon through a declining cap on emissions set by the federal government. That's a far cry from the 100 percent auction of pollution allowances advocated by Obama as a presidential candidate.\Sadly, we have no confidence that things will improve in the Senate. Despite holding a news conference in February declaring that the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee would be ""starting fresh"" and that ""we're willing to look at everything,"" Chairman Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., is using the cap-and-trade provisions of Waxman-Markey as the template for her committee's bill.\Her committee staff promises that members are being creative in looking at how to do things differently to achieve the bill's goals. Unless that includes serious consideration of a properly designed carbon tax or a cleaner cap-and-trade system that auctions a majority of the emissions credits and rebates the money to taxpayers, that's a promise that won't be fulfilled.\Credit: The Salt Lake Tribune"
47,"It looks like perfect political symmetry - party-line voting in Congress on the first key pieces of Barack Obama's agenda, matching a deep partisan divide within the electorate in judging his performance as president.\But, for reasons that require a little explanation, it may be wrong to conclude from this evidence, as many are doing, that the center has fallen out of American politics and Obama is on a fool's errand if he continues to pursue bipartisan support.\First, the data that shouts that I am wrong. No vote is more important in encapsulating the approach of the two parties to the basic issues of governing than the vote on the budget resolution for the year. It defines the spending priorities and the tax limits, along with many of the policy innovations that will be fleshed out in later legislation.\This year, not a single Republican in the House or Senate voted for the Democratic budget resolution, and not a single Democrat endorsed the Republican substitute.\The Republicans denounced the deficit-spending envisaged by the Obama-endorsed budget and decried the Democrats' habit of voting down every Republican amendment, as if none of the GOP ideas could possibly have any merit.\Democrats, for their part, called Republicans ""the party of no,"" pointing out that the GOP members of Congress had been almost as unanimously negative in their reactions to Obama's stimulus bill and the catch-up budget left over from last year's partisan gridlock.\As for the voters, the Pew Research Center reported earlier this month on a survey that showed the partisan gap in Obama's job approval scores is the widest in contemporary history. He rated a thumbs-up from 88 percent of the Democrats and only 27 percent of the Republicans in the poll - a gap of 61 points.\At a comparable point in their first terms, the gaps for George W. Bush and Bill Clinton were only 51 and 45 points, respectively. A separate Pew poll found that since January, the percentage of voters who think that Democrats and Republicans in Washington are bickering more than usual has grown by 14 points.\All this suggests the notion that Obama's election marked a change for the better in the political environment was as fanciful as Michigan State's chances against the mighty North Carolina Tar Heels.\But, still, this analysis ignores several potent factors, starting with the fact that the fastest-growing portion of the electorate consists of people who have no strong partisan allegiance. These political independents are now as numerous as self-identified Republicans and are closing the gap on the Democrats.\Though badly underrepresented in Congress, where districting rules and campaign finance practices reinforce the two-party hegemony, the independent voters make up the swing vote in almost every contested election, including the presidential race.\It is the reaction of those swing voters - or the politicians' anticipation of their shifting opinion - that drives the outcome of the big policy debates. You've had an example of this already with Obama's cap-and-trade proposal for protecting the environment from carbon discharges.\Once political independents, who like the idea of clean air, grasped that cap-and-trade would mean a big tax increase for them, Republican opposition was reinforced and Democratic support weakened to the point that the Obama plan may already be doomed this year.\The crucial role of the independents will be demonstrated again and again when Congress takes up Obama's challenge to reform health care, immigration and other broken systems, or renew arms control agreements. Because those independents are impressed when measures find prominent supporters in both parties, it will continue to behoove Obama to woo Republican help, no matter how tough the odds.\Presidents who hope to achieve great things cannot for long rely on using their congressional majorities to muscle things through. That is why a strategy based on the early roll calls and polls is likely to fail."
48,"
With a flourish of pens followed by handshakes, Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger made it official: the Beehive State is now part of the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative.
\
First reactions to the agreement were mixed.
\
Other members of the partnership to curb climate change, besides Utah and California, are New Mexico, Arizona, Washington, Oregon and the Canadian province of British Columbia. They have agreed to work toward setting standards to reduce greenhouse emissions under a market-based program called ""cap and trade.""
\
During a news conference Monday in the Governor's Mansion, Huntsman and Schwarzenegger were highly critical of the Bush administration's failure to take significant action to lower greenhouse gas emissions, notably carbon dioxide, that are blamed for global warming.
\
""Gov. Schwarzenegger's leadership on this issue, where the federal government has failed, has been instrumental,"" said Huntsman. He added that a regional approach is the best way to take action soon.
\
""We are leading the charge. We're not waiting for Washington any longer,"" he said.
\
Schwarzenegger said the agreement is huge and that it sends a clear message to the federal government: ""We are creating this partnership because of lack of leadership there.""
\
Asked by the Deseret Morning News if a reduction in CO2 might cause the country to become more dependent on nuclear power, Schwarzenegger replied that when thinking about alternative power sources, ""I think the key thing is to make sure that it is environmentally sound. And I always personally feel that until we find a way of disposing with the nuclear waste and dealing with that issue, that is still a problem.""
\
Huntsman added, ""I'll just say to that, that we have worked very, very hard to ensure that our state never becomes a dumping ground for waste. We worked very hard the last couple of years on that.
\
""And we're not going to turn around as a state and say that all of a sudden we open it up for nuclear energy, just to see things dumped here.""
\
Huntsman said technology should progress to the point that nuclear power plants will have on-site storage and reprocessing of waste.
\
""This is a period of great innovation and breakthrough, in terms of technology in the energy sector,"" he added. ""And when that happens I think we'll all feel a lot better about nuclear being part of a shared approach.""
\
The initiative would work out emissions limitations on a state and regional basis. It also would set up the ""cap and trade"" policy in which pollution control credits could be purchased.
\
Huntsman said the memorandum brings the two states together as never before in achieving goals concerning climate change. ""This will set the stage for much-needed improvements ... in our air quality, and in our state making meaningful contributions in addressing climate change.""
\
Utah should be at the vanguard on the issue, he said. Working together, states of the region can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, encourage new economic initiatives that create jobs and move more rapidly toward energy independence for the United States, according to Huntsman.
\
He cited ""advanced research"" at the University of Utah on carbon sequestration, which could help to reduce pollution from power plants. Such technology might offer a way to continue using coal, of which Utah is an important producer, without releasing dirty air.
\
""Our air isn't just ours,"" Huntsman said. ""It blows in from other states and other regions. The same happens with our water.
\
""And as the old saying goes, 'We all live downstream.'""
\
If the region does nothing, Huntsman added, it will suffer from climate change because of prolonged droughts, decreased snowfall and more severe wildland fires. ""We can either be part of a regional solution ... or we can maintain the status quo, which for this state and this governor is totally unacceptable.""
\
Schwarzenegger called the agreement ""this historic initiative to fight global warming.""
\
Westerners understand how the climate can jeopardize precious resources, he said. ""Higher temperatures are an economic threat to all of us,"" he added.
\
""We need to do everything that we can in order to do things and create the action, rather than just stay and cry,"" Schwarzenegger said. ""I think that's what leadership is all about, and that's what Gov. Huntsman has shown -- great, great leadership.""
\
With 5 percent of the world's population, the United States is emitting 25 percent of the world's greenhouse gases. The federal government ""has failed to act so it is up to us, the states, to really step up and to lead, and to set an example for the rest of the nation and the rest of the world.""
\
Tim Wagner of the Sierra Club's Utah Chapter called the agreement a positive development.
\
""It clearly indicates that the state is finally stepping up to the plate, in a big way, to start addressing this very serious issue of climate change,"" he said.
\
Wagner added that this indicates a strong willingness by Huntsman to ""take a leadership role"" for which he will be highly regarded for a long time.
\
But Sen. Darin Peterson, R-Nephi, had questions about the pact. Implementing any significant new pollution controls likely would require legislative action.
\
Peterson stressed that he is not sure of all the details, so he needs to be careful, but he has concerns.
\
""It's clear to me that man's influence on the environment is so limited that we could ruin an economy chasing something we could never catch,"" he said Monday afternoon.
\
""The biggest greenhouse gas is water vapor."" Chasing after controls of greenhouse gases ""makes me very nervous,"" he added.
\
Peterson, chairman of the Senate's Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment Committee, said people should work for economic improvements ""rather than chase those skeletons.""

WASHINGTON -- President Bush called for a halt Wednesday in the growth of greenhouse gases by 2025, acknowledging the need to head off serious climate change.
\
The plan came under fire immediately from environmentalists and congressional Democrats who favor mandatory emission cuts, a position also held by all three presidential contenders.
\
Bush in a Rose Garden address for the first time set a specific target date for U.S. climate pollution reductions and said he was ready to commit to a binding international agreement on long-term reductions as long as other countries such as China do the same.
\
""There is a wrong way and a right way to approach reducing greenhouse gas emissions,"" Bush said, making clear that he opposes a Senate measure that would impose mandatory limits on greenhouse gases beginning in five years, followed by annual reductions.
\
""Bad legislation would impose tremendous costs on our economy and American families without accomplishing the important climate change goals we share,"" the president said.
\
He said he envisions a ""comprehensive blend of market incentives and regulations"" that would encourage clean and efficient energy technologies. And he singled out the electric utility industry, saying power plants need to stabilize carbon dioxide pollution within 15 years and reduce them after that.
\
While characterized by the White House as a fresh strategy to attack climate change, the president gave no new proposals for achieving these pollution reductions.
\
He cited, instead, measures already enacted such as a 40 percent increase in auto fuel economy, a requirement for a huge increase in use of ethanol and other biofuels, and some efficiency standards, as well as a push for developing clean energy technologies.
\
Environmentalists said the Energy Department's own forecasts have shown that even with those advances -- encompassed in energy legislation approved last year -- U.S. carbon dioxide emissions are expected to increase by about 10 percent by 2025.
\
""If this is President Bush's idea of 20/20 vision he needs to get his eyes checked,"" said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., calling the new White House climate initiative ""late, insufficient and insincere.""
\
Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said Bush's remarks showed that ""he has no intention of cooperating"" to get climate legislation passed this year. ""He's basically saying take two aspirins and call President Obama, Clinton or McCain next January,"" Markey told reporters.
\
All three presidential contenders are supporters of mandatory limits -- a so-called cap-and-trade system -- to reduce climate changing pollution, mainly carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels. Sen. John McCain, the presumptive GOP nominee, has been a co-sponsor of mandatory emissions cap legislation. Democratic candidates Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton both have said they would make binding emissions reduction requirements a top priority.
\
Some conservative House Republicans have expressed privately to the White House concern about Bush's call for a timetable for emission reductions, while other congressional Republicans said they welcomed the president becoming more engaged in the issue.
\
""The president has articulated a progressive vision for a comprehensive solution to climate change,"" said Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, who has voiced concern about the economic cost of the Senate climate bill.
\
Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who like the president has been critical of mandatory caps on greenhouse emissions, said, ""It is clear ... that we both share important principles that must be part of any policy addressing climate change, including support of technology.""
\
Still, Senate Democrats and environmentalists said the president's plan would allow continued growth of greenhouse gases for nearly two decades, during which the government estimates heat-trapping emissions from U.S. electric power plants alone are expected to grow by 16 percent.
\
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Senate Energy and Environment Committee, called Bush's new climate strategy ""worse than doing nothing"" and would ""have America stand by while greenhouse gases reach dangerous levels.""
\
A climate bill expected to be taken up by the Senate in June would call for a 19 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2025 and about a 70 percent reduction by mid-century from power plants, transportation and industrial sources.
\
Bush called such a requirement ""unrealistic"" and economically damaging, but indicated that he would like to see some congressional action on climate this year to avert what aides have characterized as a ""train wreck"" of regulations under existing laws such as the Clean Air Act and Endangered Species Act.
\
These laws ""were never meant to regulate global climate change,"" said Bush, and would ""make the federal government act like a local planning and zoning board.""
\
A year ago, the Supreme Court declared that carbon dioxide is a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and directed the Environmental Protection Agency to determine whether CO2 is endangering public health or welfare. If so, the court said, the EPA must regulate CO2 emissions.
\
At the same time, the Interior Department has been told by another court to decide whether the polar bear should be brought under the protection of the Endangered Species Act because of disappearing sea ice -- a phenomenon blamed by scientists on global warming.

50,"Washington -\Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman ventured Thursday into a place that many of his rival Republican presidential candidates might fear: a dinner of environmental activists.\Blocks from the U.S. Capitol, Huntsman faced members of Republicans for Environmental Protection, sidestepping his previous support for a cap-and-trade carbon emission law and touting his record as governor on the environmental initiatives. He said he was proud of his efforts to retool the state's vehicle fleet to alternative fuels and boost scientific research on energy.\""Conservation is conservative,"" Huntsman declared, mimicking the group's motto. ""I'm not ashamed to be a conservationist. I also believe that science should be driving our decisions on climate change.""\Huntsman steered clear of mentioning that he supported a regional carbon market as governor, and that he and a few fellow governors urged then-President-Elect Barack Obama to institute a national system.\Instead, Huntsman heralded the work of Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, for whom Thursday night's dinner was named.\""Thank you for being where you are and for embracing the Theodore Roosevelt legacy,"" Huntsman said, noting the importance of being good environmental stewards for the health of Americans, their quality of life and the legacy they leave behind for future generations.\If there were a group of Republicans that Huntsman could attract to his side, this was it. Though many in the room didn't know much about him beyond his recent job as the U.S. ambassador to China. That, however, was a big positive for one pro-environment Republican in the room.\James Kahrs, an Athens, Ga., native who lived in China until recently, said that former role may actually help Huntsman's position on the environment, given China's own troubles with pollution.\""He's got a great understanding of what potentially could happen if you don't take care of the environment,"" Kahrs said.\Huntsman, whose campaign plans to take a more aggressive tone to rise out of dismal polling numbers, also took time in his address to fire a shot at his fellow White House contenders and the president.\""None of my opponents have supported a plan that would allow us to avoid default,"" Huntsman said, referring to proposed deals to raise the nation's borrowing authority and make significant spending cuts. ""This is not a time, ladies and gentlemen, to be playing politics.""\Huntsman added, seconds later, ""The president is a good man but on the most important issue of our time, that of expanding our economy and creating jobs, he has failed us.""\Huntsman, who is also slated to address a national convention of college Republicans Friday night, spent most of his speech talking up his record in Utah to push natural gas as a way to wean America off of foreign oil. During his tenure, Huntsman worked to deploy natural-gas refilling stations up and down the Interstate 15 corridor.\But Huntsman's strength on the environment may not extend too far, according to those who worked with the former governor on the issue.\Huntsman tapped his then-lieutenant governor, Gary Herbert, to head up energy and environment issues in the state, though Huntsman did step in on occasion.\How is his record regarded? Depends on whom you ask.\""We certainly did not always agree with the governor,"" says Scott Groene, the executive director of the environmental group Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. ""But he showed a willingness to try to reach balance on environmental issues that we had not seen before or since here in Utah.""\That willingness also earned Huntsman the scorn of some of Utah's more conservative Republicans who wanted to see more of the federal land in Utah opened up for ATV riders and oil and gas exploration.\""I was definitely at odds with him,"" says Rep. Mike Noel, a Kanab Republican who has fought restrictions on federal land and joined lawsuits to overturn protection designations. ""He was on one side of the equation and I was on the other. He's definitely a lot more green than I would want my president to be.""\Noel, who has endorsed rival presidential candidate Mitt Romney, says he believes Huntsman to be fiscally conservative and strong on other Republican issues.\tburr@sltrib.com\Huntsman: 'Conservation is conservative'\Credit: By Thomas Burr The Salt Lake Tribune"

NEW YORK -- Greenhouse gases went on sale Thursday as 10 Northeastern states held the nation's first auction of pollution credits aimed at curbing global warming.
\
""It is time really to turn the tide on global warming,"" said New York Gov. David Paterson, who opened the auction by ringing the ceremonial bell at the New York Mercantile Exchange. ""And we hope that we've done this today.""
\
The program puts a price on carbon-dioxide pollution, giving power plants a financial incentive to cut emissions.
\
Auction proceeds will go toward energy conservation and renewable energy programs in each of the 10 participating states: New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Vermont.
\
The program aims to hold carbon dioxide emissions steady through 2014 and then gradually reduce them; it is widely viewed as a model for future programs nationally and around the globe.
\
""It's historic,"" said Lance Pierce, climate program director of the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""The carbon markets have arrived in the United States. And carbon markets, if designed correctly, hold the promise for development of cleaner energy ... and reductions in global-warming pollution that benefit consumers, businesses and the environment, as well.""
\
The Northeast effort, called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, limits the total amount of carbon that power plants in the 10 states can pump out of their smokestacks at the current level -- 188 million tons.
\
Electric power generators must pay for allowances covering the amount of carbon they emit, and the initiative will provide a market-based auction and trading system in which the generators can buy, sell and trade the emissions allowances.
\
The initiative covers more than 200 fossil fuel power plants, requiring that the owners of those plants pay for the carbon dioxide they emit.
\
It will gradually reduce carbon emissions by reducing the emissions limit in a series of steps, until it is 10 percent below the current level a decade from now. The companies that don't reduce emissions can buy allowances from companies that have, thereby creating a financial incentive to reduce pollution because the more environmentally friendly plants won't have to buy as many credits and because they can sell any they don't need.
\
Dale Bryk, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said, ""This new energy plan is straightforward, highly cost-effective and creates a clean energy pathway for the rest of the country to follow. It is the shape of things to come.""
\
Carbon dioxide trading already exists in Europe. Some carbon dioxide allowances also are being traded in the United States on a voluntary basis through the Chicago Climate Exchange. But the Northeast effort is the America's first mandatory effort to limit carbon dioxide.
\
The initiative took five years to bear fruit. George Pataki, New York's governor at that time, brought together nine other governors five years ago to develop a regional strategy to limit carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.
\
Other regional greenhouse gas coalitions, such as the Western Climate Initiative and the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Accord, are in earlier stages of development.
\
New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine, who joined Paterson at a news conference at the Mercantile Exchange, noted that both John McCain and Barack Obama support cap-and-trade programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Corzine said ""there is building momentum"" to enact federal legislation.
\
In response to critics who have argued that the limit is too high, Corzine said, ""I think we need to make sure that the mechanics of the auction process and the system work."" He said the limit could be lowered at subsequent auctions if the initiative's member states determine it's too high to have the intended effect.
\
Thursday's auction was run by World Energy, an operator of online green exchanges. Results will be released Monday, pending review by an independent monitor.

As the mean world temperature slowly rises, the political heat for reduction of energy consumption is beginning to simmer. Governors and mayors are making gestures of leadership. With the recent rock extravaganza devoted to energy conservation, can political action be far behind?
\
To date, environmental advocates have relied on moral admonitions to reduce our carbon footprint -- use fluorescent lights, drive hybrids, be organic -- and politicians have trotted out the usual painless panaceas of new technologies and tax breaks to go green. But if the temperature continues to rise or even if it is perceived to be rising, the choice is going to come down to direct regulation of carbon use or to higher prices of oil and coal to compensate for their costs to the environment. The higher prices could be the result of a carbon tax or a market for CO2 emission permits or some other device that would internalize the worldwide external cost from the use of fossil fuels.
\
Neither regulation nor higher energy prices are likely to be attractive to politicians, but experience suggests they will choose regulation given the powerful organized forces that favor regulation. This fundamental choice between the use of price and regulation to solve global warming could be the most important economic decision of coming decades.
\
The justice lobby will favor regulation. Price rationing invariably raises the issues of fairness and inequality. The poor will not only be choosing between food and prescription drugs, they will be choosing between food and heat in the winter or cool in the summer.
\
Those who make their living through a bigger and more powerful government will also favor direct regulation. Whatever else could be said about direct regulation, we can be sure that it increases the demand for regulators and for those who are paid to influence the regulators. The political sentiment against regulation will have to be strong to stave off the political class's natural tendencies.
\
Somewhat surprisingly, environmental activists also seem to be drawn to regulation rather than price change. Their ambivalence about price change comes from the moral dimension of the global warming movement. To the environmental moralists, no one should be allowed to drive that big SUV, even if they have to pay more to do it. No one should be allowed to indulge the taste for a long hot shower.
\
With a coalition of the fairness lobby, the bigger government lobby and the environmental moralists all favoring regulation and a growing perception that we must do something, direct control of our energy consumption seems to be in our future even though it would be a profound policy mistake. The market for energy feeds into all other markets. Mistakes in the energy market translate into mistakes everywhere. The price of energy may be even more important than the interest rate in decisionmaking.
\
Market-determined prices, including those with a tax or cap and trade intervention, have two very attractive features. First, prices deliver a higher level of efficiency in the economy because every household and business can key off of the same set of prices. Second and most important, prices give us the freedom to make our own decisions subject to the proviso that we pay the price.
\
There will be constant moralizing about energy use. If we choose government regulation over higher prices, we will undoubtedly suffer from a less-efficient economy. But more significantly, we will give up some of our freedom. No one likes higher prices. But I would rather live free with higher energy prices than die from a thousand petty regulations and moral homilies.

53,"The Utah Senate on Monday refused to support a voluntary greenhouse gas reduction market that one senator said could help municipalities and service districts make money by reducing pollution.\A few Utah entities -- notably Weber County with a methane production plant that saves landfill space and reduces carbon emissions -- already sell carbon credits on the Chicago Climate Exchange. By reducing their greenhouse gas output, they can sell their credits to multinational companies that can then show customers and investors that they're acting on behalf of the environment.\Sen. Ross Romero, D-Salt Lake City, proposed SB128 to make it state policy to support these efforts, removing what he said may be confusion about whether cities, counties and districts are allowed to participate. Its defeat in the Senate on a 14-11 vote doesn't outlaw the practice, but Romero said he had hoped to encourage more participation.\""It augments revenue for these entities,"" Romero said, noting that Weber County has made $102,000. ""It decreases landfill space, which is a good thing.""\Some senators rejected the measure because they said creating carbon markets is a precursor to a federally mandated cap-and-trade carbon market that they believe will burden energy consumers. Such a market, if approved by Congress, would require companies wanting to exceed a set limit on carbon emissions to pay for credits that other companies sell after polluting less.\Sen. Chris Buttars, R-West Jordan, said climate change theory is based on ""junk science"" that the state shouldn't support. He objected to the bill as an incremental step toward taxation akin to other small steps toward big government.\""That's how we got in this mess of socialism in our lives,"" he said. Sen. Curt Bramble, R-Provo, read from the Chicago Climate Exchange's Web site, saying it's clearly advocating carbon reduction. Among other things, the site says the exchange is meant to ""help inform public debate on managing the risk of global climate change.""\""This is really cap-and-trade light,"" Bramble said\Senate rejects carbon trading\Credit: By Brandon Loomis The Salt Lake Tribune"

Despite sweeping Democratic successes in the past two national elections, continuing job losses and President Barack Obama's slipping support could lead to double-digit losses for the party in next year's congressional races and may even threaten their House control.
\
Fifty-four new Democrats were swept into the House in 2006 and 2008, helping the party claim a decisive majority as voters soured on a Republican president and embraced Obama's message of hope and change. Many of the new Democrats are in districts carried by Republican John McCain in last year's presidential contest; others are in traditional swing districts that have proved tough for either party to hold.
\
From New Hampshire to Nevada, House Democrats also will be forced to defend votes on Obama's $787 billion economic recovery package and on energy legislation viewed by many as a job killer in an already weak economy.
\
Add to that the absence of Obama from the top of the ticket, which could reduce turnout among blacks, liberals and young people, and the likelihood of a highly motivated GOP base confused by the president's proposed health-care plan and angry at what they consider reckless spending and high debt.
\
Taken together, it could be the most toxic environment for Democrats since 1994, when the party lost 34 House incumbents and 54 seats altogether. Democrats currently have a 256-178 edge in the House, with one vacancy. Republicans would have to pick up 40 seats to regain control.
\
""When you have big sweeps as Democrats did in 2006 and 2008, inevitably some weak candidates get elected. And when the environment gets even moderately challenging, a number of them are going to lose,"" said Jack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College in California.
\
Since the mid-19th century, the party that controls the White House has lost seats in virtually every midterm election. The exceptions were in 1934, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt navigated the Great Depression, and in 2002, after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, strengthened George W. Bush's image as a leader.
\
With history as a guide, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who heads the party's House campaign committee, said he has warned colleagues to be prepared for an exceptionally challenging environment going into 2010.
\
But Van Hollen said voters will make their choices on the strength of the national economy and will reward Democrats for working aggressively to improve it.
\
""We passed an economic recovery bill with zero help from Republican colleagues,"" he said. ""I think voters will see that and will ask themselves, 'Who was there to get the economy moving again, and who was standing in the way?' ""
\
Democrats have gotten off to a much faster start than Republicans in fundraising for 2010. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had $10.2 million in the bank at the end of July, with debts of $5.3 million. The National Republican Congressional Committee had just $4 million in cash and owed $2.75 million.
\
The economy poses the biggest problem for Democrats, with job losses of 2.4 million nationwide since Obama took office. Despite recent signs the country is pulling out of the recession, the unemployment rate in 15 states still was in double digits in July, led by Michigan at 15 percent.
\
Democrats must defend as many as 60 marginal seats next year, as opposed to about 40 for Republicans. Among those, about 27 Democratic and just 13 Republican seats are seen as especially ripe for a party switch.
\
Most of the closest races involve Democrats who rode the Obama tide in 2008.
\
The ""cap and trade"" bill that narrowly passed the House last spring is creating headaches for several Democrats. The legislation, which would cap carbon emissions and tax industries that exceed the cap as a way to reduce global warming, is largely unpopular in areas of the country where jobs rely on oil, gas or coal production.
\
One Democrat most affected is New Mexico Democrat Harry Teague. His district, which McCain carried last year, is one of the largest oil and gas producing areas in the country, and Teague has faced angry crowds back home ever since voting yes.
\
Teague will face Republican Steve Pearce, who held the seat for three terms before giving it up to run unsuccessfully for the Senate last year.
\
Without Obama on the ticket, a lower predicted black turnout in 2010 could also affect Democrats in several tight races in the South. These include Reps. Bobby Bright and Parker Griffith of Alabama, Travis Childers of Mississippi, and Tom Perriello of Virginia, who won by just 745 votes last year in a district that is 24 percent black.
\
Concerns about Obama's health-care plan and the mounting federal debt could ensnare two first-term Florida Democrats, Alan Grayson and Suzanne Kosmas. Both represent districts along the state's competitive I-4 corridor, which is heavily populated by independent voters and retirees. Polls show Obama has lost ground among both of those demographic groups nationwide.
"
55,"Hillary Rodham Clinton has a new plan to ramp up emissions-free renewable energy. That puts her head-and-shoulders above her GOP rivals, who range from climate chickens to climate deniers. Nevertheless, her plan is plainly worse than what she ran on eight years ago ccc and it has a glaring gap.\Clinton's proposal came under immediate scrutiny in part because she hasn't taken a strong stand on the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline since leaving the State Department. But, like the rest of the debate on the pipeline, this reaction misses the point. The fate of the planet does not depend on a single oil infrastructure project but on the high-level policy that will shape the market for clean energy. On this, Clinton has some ideas; the problem is that they are all second-best ideas.\Clinton's strategy begins with a pledge to defend President Barack Obama's greenhouse-gas regulations, the final version of which will emerge soon from the Environmental Protection Agency. Those underpin Obama's promise to world leaders that the United States will reduce its greenhouse emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent by 2025 and increase renewables to 20 percent of the power grid by 2030. Clinton would enhance that commitment, promising that a full third of U.S. electricity would come from renewables by 2027, with an emphasis on installing new solar panels.\To get there, Clinton would put up federal cash to spur competition among states to reduce emissions. She would invest in more energy research and development. Yet it's curious that Clinton didn't offer a specific commitment to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, as she did in her previous White House run, preferring instead to articulate a renewables goal. Emissions are what drive climate change; renewables are just one tool to reduce them.\The best translation of that principle into policy is simple: Get rid of the country's complex web of energy subsidies and replace it with a price on carbon dioxide emissions. This wouldn't tilt the playing field, as some erroneously allege. It would flatten it, forcing emitters to pay for the dangerous damage they do to the environment.\The drawbacks are all political. The term ""carbon tax"" doesn't play well. ""Cap and trade"" has been smeared. Yet Clinton favored a cap-and-trade plan in 2007, and the case for carbon pricing has grown only stronger since then.\Clinton grandee John Podesta assures that ""these proposals are only the first steps in an ambitious climate and energy strategy."" We hope so."
56,"Utah lawmakers pressed forward Friday with their objections to dealing with climate disruption. And Utah scientists, academics and other leaders pushed back.\At a Friday night rally at the University of Utah, more than 100 people came out to hear the counter debate to the Legislature's two resolutions urging no action on climate policies. More than four dozen colleagues from Utah's colleges and universities have now backed up a Feb. 3 letter by Brigham Young University earth scientists who say that the time for debate over climate science is past and leaders should focus instead on taking meaningful action to deal with the problem. Among them is Utah's Nobel Prize-winning biologist Mario R. Capecchi.\Barry Bickmore, a BYU geochemist and author of the BYU letter, said he agreed with some of the concerns lawmakers have about the government's strategy to address climate change, like proposed cap-and-trade legislation. But he also thinks something needs to be done about the human-generated greenhouse gas emissions that are throwing the world climate system dangerously out of balance.\""Make no mistake -- doing nothing about climate change is very risky at this point,"" he told the crowd in a University of Utah auditorium. ""I believe our Legislature needs to send a message that they are trying to think of viable solutions to the problem and making sure the concerns of their constituents are being heard.""\Friday morning, the House Committee on Public Utilities and Technology approved a nonbinding resolution, 6-2, to urge Gov. Gary Herbert to pull out of the Western Climate Initiative.\If Utah were to withdraw from the six-state climate alliance, which is developing a region-wide cap-and-trade program, it would become the second state to do so. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed an executive order last week ending her state's participation in the regional carbon-reduction program. But Herbert is not looking to follow suit at this time, said Ted Wilson, the governor's chief environment advisor.\University of Utah engineering professor Joseph Andrade said the measure undermines the state's spirit of invention by showing ""protectionism"" toward the traditional fossil-fuel industries.\""That would be, in my opinion,"" he said, ""exactly the wrong message to send"" to companies thinking about using Utah as an incubator for their alternative energy innovations.\Andrade and Bickmore both attended the Senate Workforce Services and Community and Economic Development Committee meeting, where members tabled plans to take up another climate-related resolution because its sponsor, Rep. Kerry Gibson, R-Ogden, failed to show up to present it. The measure, which already won House passage this week on a 56-17 vote, urges the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to drop plans for carbon dioxide regulations.\When some of the three dozen speakers who had come to oppose the bill complained about not getting an opportunity to speak, Committee Chairman Jerry W. Stevenson, R-Layton, said he would put it on the agenda for next Friday afternoon's meeting.\Drew Thompson, a U. physics student, said he had organized fellow students on the issue after reading that some lawmakers doubt the scientific evidence pointing to climate disruption and rejecting any role in helping deal with an issue important to his generation.\""It's kind of like the state is sticking its head in the sand,"" he said, noting he will return to testify next week.\At the evening forum, eighth-grader Brian Gregory, 13, had a similar complaint. He said his future depends on leaders heeding the warnings of the climate scientists.\""The politicians, they don't seem to care,"" he told the rally audience. ""They deny the existence of a climate crisis as if they know more than the scientists, which even I, an eighth-grader, know that the politicians do not know more than the scientists when it comes to science.""\Rocky Anderson, a leader in climate-change advocacy when he was Salt Lake City mayor, concluded the rally with a call to action.\""There is no greater priority at this time in human history than to do all we can to reduce CO2 and the accumulating carbon blanket in the atmosphere,"" he said. ""Let us do all we can and no longer allow those who hold elective office to betray our sacred roles as stewards for the future.""\fahys@sltrib.com\Credit: By Judy Fahys The Salt Lake Tribune"
57,"
WASHINGTON -- Fed up with federal inaction and convinced of the dangers from global warming, five governors from Western states agreed Monday to work together to reduce greenhouse gases.
\
Their promise to target global warming was the latest of a rush of new ideas shared this week as states push ahead on climate change and clean or alternative energy.
\
""Thankfully the country has reached a tipping point on this issue. I wish we had done it 20 years ago,"" said Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican who last week signed into law a requirement that utilities generate a quarter of their power from renewable sources such as wind, water and the sun by 2025. ""Governors, members of Congress and others are now scrambling to be bold.""
\
The twin challenges of global warming and energy were some of the dominant points of discussion over four days at the annual winter meeting of the National Governors Association.
\
Others discussed legislation to encourage ""clean-coal"" technology; the economic growth that would come from industries in windmills, solar panels and the like; and tax incentives to spur more renewable energy.
\
But out West, increasingly common droughts and bad fire seasons added urgency. The governors of Arizona, California, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington state agreed to develop a regional target to lower greenhouse gases and create a market-based program aimed at helping businesses reach the still-undecided goals.
\
New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat seeking his party's presidential nomination, said the five-state agreement should spur other states ahead. ""You're going to see a domino effect with more and more states taking action,"" Richardson said.
\
On everyone's lips was Sunday night's Oscar for former Vice President Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" -- a documentary that illustrated the changes to the nation's climate and the dangers ahead.
\
""We must encourage all the governors to sign onto these partnerships,"" said California GOP Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has pursued some of the most aggressive efforts in the country. ""I just want to make sure that everyone works together and fights global warming.""
\
Schwarzenegger said a so-called cap-and-trade program, which lets companies that can't meet their emission reduction targets buy credits from those that reduce carbon dioxide, would provide ""a powerful framework for developing a national cap-and-trade program. ... This agreement shows the power of states to lead our nation addressing climate change.""
\
Such a market pact is close to becoming reality among a number of Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, which plan to impose caps on power plant emissions and encourage trading of allowances among utilities. More than 2 dozen states have drawn up plans to combat warming in various forms, and many governors have signed onto efforts to use 25 percent renewable energy sources by 2025.
\
The latest agreement -- called the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative -- builds on earlier efforts.
\
Last year, Schwarzenegger signed California legislation imposing a first-in-the-nation emissions cap on utilities, refineries and manufacturing plants, with a goal of cutting greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2020. And Schwarzenegger and British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced plans to work toward a possible joint emissions- trading market.
\
New Mexico and Arizona last year agreed to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions. A similar joint effort on climate change was agreed upon in 2003 by California, Oregon and Washington.
\
President Bush also spoke out on his administration's work on energy issues, telling governors after private meetings Monday morning that his efforts to expand research and use of alternative fuels would reduce gasoline consumption by 20 percent over the next 10 years.
\
""It's in our national security interest, it's in our national economic interest, and it will enable us to be better stewards of the environment,"" he said.
\
There also are numerous proposals before Congress to move ahead on energy and climate change.
\
Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat who has passionately advocated clean technology for coal -- a material that exists in great amounts in his state -- said emission targets and trading systems like those promised by the latest state agreement are the best way to spur change.
\
""We need customers to ask -- no, demand -- if you're going to sell us electricity, it needs to be either wind-driven, solar- driven or zero-emissions coal,"" Schweitzer said.
\
Carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels is the biggest of the greenhouse gases, so called because they create a heat-trapping blanket when released into the atmosphere. Others are methane, nitrous oxide and synthetic gases. Scientists say the atmosphere holds more carbon dioxide now than it has for hundreds of thousands of years.
"
58,"Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal issued a dire warning Thursday that if President Barack Obama is re-elected, the nation's energy sector would see ""continued hostility"" toward production and a potential cap-and-trade edict.\""You already see it in the first term,"" Jindal said. Leasing offshore is down 30 percent. ""We're already seeing a hostile regulatory environment that is diminishing production of energy.""\Jindal was in a town meeting with representatives from 17 energy companies, raising money for Gov. Gary Herbert's re-election campaign. Herbert has raised more than $235,000 from energy companies since his last election -- $1 out of every $6 he has raised.\Jindal has just been elected to a second term as governor of Louisiana and said he isn't interested in running as Mitt Romney's vice presidential candidate.\""I've got the job that I want,"" said Jindal, noting that he is just beginning to tackle retirement reform in his state and has other goals to accomplish.\But Jindal said he will do everything he can to get Romney elected and threw some tough charges at the Obama administration.\Jindal said that, if Obama is re-elected, he wouldn't be able to get a cap-and-trade bill through Congress, but he is concerned that the administration could try to achieve it through a ""regulatory fiat.""\And Jindal said that the Obama administration has brought America high unemployment and high deficits, and ""you've got a president who is leading us toward a European socialist-type government.""\The Obama campaign said Jindal is skewing the numbers.\""Here are the facts: President Obama has aggressively pursued an all-of-the-above energy strategy,"" said Obama campaign spokesman Tom Reynolds. ""As domestic oil production has reached an 8-year high and our dependence on foreign oil has fallen to a 16-year low, the president has also made historic investments in renewable energy, reduction of energy waste, the [research and development] of clean coal technology and expanded, safe natural gas extraction.""\Reynolds said that Romney raised the gas tax as Massachusetts governor, has opposed fuel economy standards, and supported tax breaks for oil and gas companies.\Jindal was flying to Colorado for a fundraiser there, then headed to New Mexico to raise money for Republican Gov. Susana Martinez before returning to Louisiana.\During Utah stop, Jindal says Obama would hurt energy\Rocky Mountain Roundtable\Gov. Gary Herbert will host his counterparts from Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada and Colorado on Friday to discuss energy, public land, water and other regional issues in a Rocky Mountain Roundtable.\""The hope is ... we'll start a dialogue that will bring governors together,"" Herbert said during his monthly KUED news conference. ""We're smaller-in-population states and don't have quite the political muscle. I think uniting our voices will help us get better outcomes out of Washington, D.C., when it comes to policy affecting the West and the people who live here.""\Idaho Gov. Butch Otter, Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead and Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval are all scheduled to attend the meetings at the Governor's Mansion. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, the only Democrat of the group, will also participate via teleconference.\Herbert said that, in addition to a discussion of public lands and access to natural resources, energy and water, the governors would also discuss endangered species issues and could potentially have a dialogue about immigration enforcement.\Herbert said that Hickenlooper, in particular, believes states should be doing more when it comes to immigration and is interested in Utah's approach.\Environmental groups have scheduled a protest at noon outside the Governor's Mansion during the meetings.\Credit: By Robert Gehrke The Salt Lake Tribune"
59,"Washington -\Sen. Bob Bennett says the path to a clean energy future isn't by capping and trading carbon emissions, but by building, building, building.\Bennett said Monday the nation needs to construct 100 new nuclear reactors by 2030 -- doubling the nation's current number of 104 plants -- if it is serious about slashing carbon emissions while still producing enough electricity to keep up with American needs.\Bennett also brought together three other Republican senators and pro-nuclear energy witnesses to argue for constructing new nuke plants.\""It's been my experience and my position...that one of the driving forces behind America's economic growth has been our access to cheap energy,"" Bennett said at a Republican-only hearing on energy development he organized. ""If we're going to survive in the kind of economy we want, we need to have access to cheap energy.""\That means, Bennett says, reviving the idea of building new nuclear reactors, a move the United States hasn't made since 1977. He wasn't alone in that thought.\""The president has said Iran can produce electricity through nuclear power, so why in the world should we not in the United States begin to pick up the technology that we invented,"" Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said.\""The future of energy is clean energy,"" said Sen. Jim Bunning of Kentucky, including, ""building at least 100 new nuclear power plans in the next 20 to 25 years.""\Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said he was stumped why anyone would oppose such a construction blitz.\""You'd think that all Americans can come together on a plan like that,"" Wicker said.\Of course, one reason even nuclear-industry officials raise is the lack of a solution to tens of thousands of tons of nuclear waste piling up at reactors across the country. The Obama administration has essentially killed the plan to store the waste under Yucca Mountain north of Las Vegas, and Congress has yet to decide what to do with the radioactive spent fuel now parked at nuclear plants.\A panel of experts, invited by the ad-hoc committee Bennett chaired Monday, dismissed nuclear-waste concerns.\""How many people are being hurt by waste? It is not occurring in the real world,"" said Ted Rockwell, a fellow at the American Nuclear Society and a member of the National Academy of Engineering.\Rockwell later joked that nuclear waste can stay safe in dry ceramic casks at nuclear plants as long as someone posts a sign that says, ""Do not eat the ceramic.""\""If you don't eat it, it's not going to hurt you,"" Rockwell said.\Nuclear waste opponents beg to differ.\""To propose 100 new nuclear reactors and ignore the waste issue is the height of irresponsibility,"" said Vanessa Pierce, executive director of the Healthy Environment Alliance of Utah. Nuclear waste is ""dangerous, it's a terrorist target and it's an unsolved problem.""\Bennett, who attempted to slip $100 billion in loans for innovative clean energy solutions into the massive stimulus bill, which critics contended was a bailout for the nuclear industry, supports reprocessing waste. That process, which is used in France but not in the United States, is costly, and still leaves behind more potent nuclear refuse, Pierce says.\""The thing is, reprocessing doesn't get rid of all the nuclear waste,"" she said. ""Reprocessing is not a cure-all.""\Bennett hosted the hearing on Monday as an alternative to a Democratic attempt to pass laws that would limit the amount of carbon a company can produce. The plan also would launch a market on which to sell carbon-emission allotments, a move commonly called cap and trade.\Bennett says he opposes the current Democratic proposal.\""I have yet to see a cap-and-trade regime that makes any sense to me,"" Bennett said. ""I won't say never but pretty close.""\tburr@sltrib.com\Credit: By Thomas Burr The Salt Lake Tribune"
60,"ddemille@thespectrum.com\ST. GEORGE - Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. moved to the national stage Saturday when President Barack Obama nominated him as the new U.S. Ambassador to China.\Between approval ratings of nearly 80 percent and talk from political pundits pegging him for a Presidential run in 2012, Huntsman said he wasn't looking for a new job and didn't expect ""to be called into action"" by John McCain's winning rival.\""But I grew up understanding that the most basic responsibility one has is service to country,"" he said, standing with Obama as his family looked on. ""When the president of the United States asks you to step up and serve in a capacity like this, that to me is the end of the conversation and the beginning of the obligation to rise to the challenge.""\The announcement of Huntsman's appointment took a number of people by surprise, and could derail the governor's plans for Utah's energy future. Or the state just might follow him into the spotlight.\""I genuinely believe we are going to play a leading role,"" Huntsman said in an interview last week, calling Utah the place where a true renewable energy transformation could begin - one that could change the way the U.S., and even the rest of the world, looks at energy.\Those ambitions sound good to residents who have been waiting for alternative energy to take off, like Drew Blad, the owner of a solar business in Hurricane.\Blad, who started his business in 1999, said money has always been the biggest question with solar power. He said most of his customers are people looking to help the environment, or looking to invest in something that might pay off sometime in the future.\""We're still not down to the price where we want it to be,"" he said.\Huntsman, who has been an advocate for more proactive action to combat global warming, saying the state has a responsibility to address the issue for the sake of future generations, wants to see that change, with a combination of technology development and state-initiated support. He has faced opposition from fellow Republicans for his support of a cap-and-trade system on greenhouse gas emissions, and numerous challenges remain for a nation largely powered by fossil fuels, but Huntsman maintains that Utah can become an example of renewable energy done right, with a reduced carbon footprint and improved energy security.\As a delegate to China, the country that recently passed the U.S. as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases - he speaks fluent Mandarin Chinese - Huntsman said he believes there is room for a state to step forward.\Even smaller projects, such as St. George's SunSmart solar farm, can make a difference by getting the ball rolling.\""They don't need to be world-scale at this point,"" he said. ""All we need to do is prove to people that we're serious about this.""\Huntsman said a dozen major companies have already made overtures to Utah following the passage of two key renewable energy bills in the state Legislature earlier this year.\State lawmakers approved the creation of renewable energy development zones, where companies can receive tax credits for renewable energy developments that create jobs, and the creation of a renewable energy authority that will have the power to issue bonds to connect alternative energy sources to the state's power grid.\The Huntsman-appointed Utah Renewable Energy Zone Task Force reported that Utah has the potential to develop solar, wind and geothermal energy resources on more than 13,000 square miles throughout the state. The potential for solar-generated electricity alone adds up to 826 gigawatts of utility-scale energy - enough to power every home in the country.\""The key now is how do we capitalize on it,"" said Sarah Wright, executive director of Utah Clean Energy, an advocacy group based in Salt Lake City.\Utah Clean Energy released an economic study this year that reported Utah would gain 7,000 new jobs, and $310 million in new earnings if it were to achieve a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency by 2015 and 20 percent of electricity sales from renewable resources by 2020.\The study doesn't account for possible economic impacts of cap-and-trade, however, a practice a majority of Utah's Republican state leaders say would be a burden on businesses, and would result in higher rates for consumers.\That issue is still under debate, but whatever the outcome, Huntsman seems determined to encourage growth in renewable energy - from Utah to China, and beyond.\""The challenge will be for us to maintain an open mind, and the willingness to shoulder this thing forward as we try to be the premier destination in the nation,"" he said.\Info Box:Info Box"
61,"Randall Tolpinrud returned to Utah Sunday, just as crunch time arrived in Copenhagen for a new, international agreement on tackling climate change.\But Tolpinrud, president of the Salt Lake City-based Pax Natura foundation, is returning heartened that his cause -- protecting rain forests as a kind of carbon currency -- will be addressed in any deal that comes out of the conference. It's part of the groundwork that was laid during the conference's first week, when 16,000 attendees crowded into the city each day with what Tolpinrud described as a shared determination and energy.\With no less than a conviction that humankind's future is on the line, there is ""overwhelming consensus"" about the desired outcome, he said.\""Let's get this done.""\With the conference set to end Friday, key negotiators for 192 nations will deliberate this week about a climate strategy to replace the Kyoto climate treaty when it expires in 2012. A central controversy continues to be the role of rich, developed nations in helping poor, undeveloped nations deal with the impacts of climate change.\Utah's ties to the conference reflect the range of interests in play.\Tolpinrud attended as an observer alongside the Costa Rican government, which has been working with his foundation for more than a decade on capturing carbon in threatened forests.\Rio Tinto, the parent company of Kennecott Utah Copper, and a clean-energy activist are also among those with Utah ties who are laying the groundwork for results at the Copenhagen climate conference.\Last Wednesday, Ashley Anderson joined about 50 other young activists in crashing the Copenhagen, ""Hot Air Tour,"" hosted by the climate-contrarian group, Americans for Prosperity. The activists unfurled two banners at the conference and chanted ""real Americans for prosperity are Americans for clean energy"" for five minutes as the few people attending looked on.\Hot Air speaker, Lord Christopher Monckton called them ""crazed Hitler youth"" and ""nazis.""\""We were fighting for a more intelligent, more humane, more thoughtful future,"" said Anderson, a clean-energy advocate who took part in the protest.\""Lord Monckton, and those that organized [the skeptics' convention,] are fighting for their perceived right to steer the reckless speedboat of callous capitalism right into a crowd of future generations who are gathered at the shore,"" he said in a statement. ""We rejected that today and sunk their selfish and scarcely populated ship.""\For Rio Tinto, the world mining company that employs 2,400 in Utah, including 1,800 at Kennecott Utah Copper, having a seat at the table in Copenhagen is critical to the company's health, said Jeffrey Hopkins, principal advisor at the company for energy and climate strategy.\The company, which had revenues exceeding $54 billion from its worldwide operations last year and hauled about $1 billion in profits from its Utah operations, insists that dealing with climate is essential not only for the environment but also the industry's future.\""We want to go in and support the process"" in Copenhagen, said Hopkins. ""Since climate change is a global problem, it needs a global solution.""\Rio Tinto is part of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, a business and environmental group coalition that wants a cap-and-trade system for lowering greenhouse gasses. And it also signed onto the Copenhagen Communique, a statement signed by 500 companies worldwide advocating for ""a strong, effective and equitable international climate framework.""\In addition, Hopkins noted, the company wants to know how coal, carbon and molybdenum figure into climate strategies and energy costs.\""We think the current level of uncertainty is decreasing investment in new coal-based [energy] generation,"" Hopkins added, noting that Rio Tinto is a partner in the $2 billion, low-carbon power plant in Kern County, Calif.\For Tolpinrud, progress on Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, or REDD, is long overdue. Pax Natura's work with the Costa Rican government has helped show how tropical forests can be preserved for the vast amount of carbon stored in their biomass, he said.\""It's the one area of climate credits that is the least politically charged,"" he said.\And, while the ""Climategate"" hacked e-mail controversy has captured attention in the English-speaking media in recent weeks, the climate change debate in Copenhagen is not about the soundness of the science but about how to address a problem with impacts that are already seen worldwide, Tolpinrud said.\""It's important for our children to understand this is an opportunity to build the world on a much more sustainable basis,"" said the father of three.\""Children need a reason to hope the future is possible for them.""\fahys@sltrib.com\Forests and climate\Randall Tolpinrud, a Utahn observing the Copenhagen talks, explained the value of forests in dealing with climate.\""Bottom line: The primary reason for a cap-and-trade bill with offsetting [credits, like the carbon-capture through forests] is to allow time for fuel switching, renewable energy development, carbon, capture and storage, etc. This takes time, but stopping the destruction of tropical forest is immediate, with benefits -- including the side benefits of biodiversity conservation -- accruing now.\Forest carbon credits are the low-hanging fruit of climate change mitigation at a fraction of the cost of any other known technological fix. Tropical forest credits range currently from $2-$7 per ton of carbon dioxide versus carbon, capture and storage (CCS) at approximately $40-$90, or renewable energy development at approximately $20 per ton of carbon dioxide.""\For more information:\The Copenhagen Communique signed by 500 companies:\www.cpsl.cam.ac.uk/pdf/cop-communique-brochure-dec09-low-res.pdf\A link to video of the clean-energy youth demostration:\www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-dorner/of-climate-deniers-and-hi_b_388784.html\To learn more about Pax Natura:\www.paxnatura.org/\Credit: By Judy Fahys The Salt Lake Tribune"
62,"This week, Pope Francis is expected to implore both the U.S. Congress and the UN General Assembly to take aggressive steps to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. His thinking on this issue is not simple alarm over climate change. It involves an extraordinary combination of passionate environmentalism, concern for the poor, skepticism about economics and apparent hostility to ""profits."" All this makes for an impressive but occasionally awkward argument.\In his recent book-length encyclical on the subject, Pope Francis seeks to link three seemingly unrelated problems: environmental degradation, poverty and spiritual emptiness. He wants to ""replace consumption with sacrifice, greed with generosity, wastefulness with a spirit of sharing."" Time and again, he points to ""consumerism"" as a major source of the world's problems.\Human beings are endangering the planet as a result of ""a period of irrational confidence in progress and human abilities,"" the pope says. Dirty air produces millions of premature deaths. Our ""throwaway society"" fouls our waters and produces more waste than we can handle. Limiting climate change requires ""changes of lifestyle, production and consumption.""\For poor people who are already struggling, Pope Francis shows, a warmer climate will make things far worse. While climate change threatens all nations, developing countries are at special risk, not least because they depend on agriculture, fishing and forestry, all of which are threatened by rising temperatures. In the encyclical, the word ""poor"" appears 61 times.\At this point, you might expect that he would explore the difficult trade-offs that leaders of developing nations ccc including China, India, and Brazil ccc face. They have been working to reduce poverty through rapid economic growth, and that takes more energy, not less. For what they see as moral reasons, these leaders prioritize growth, not reductions in carbon emissions. Can poor nations ccc or, for that matter, rich ones ccc be expected to bear the costs of significantly scaling back?\That's mostly an economic question, but Pope Francis seems skeptical about how much economists can help. In the face of environmental risks, he insists that we ""reject a magical conception of the market, which would suggest that problems can be solved simply by an increase in the profits of companies or individuals.""\Fair enough. But economists don't favor such a magical conception. They believe that the best way to reduce pollution, including greenhouse-gas emissions, is to require people to ""internalize"" the environmental costs ccc for example, through carbon taxes.\Pope Francis is not enthusiastic about that idea, because it would impose significant costs on poor nations, perpetrating an injustice ""under the guise of protecting the environment.""\For similar reasons, he disapproves of buying and selling ""carbon credits"" ccc a system of cap and trade, another idea that economists like. He objects that it wouldn't ""allow for the radical change which present circumstances require,"" and might turn out to be ""a ploy which permits maintaining the excessive consumption of some countries and sectors.""\Instead, the Pope argues, there is an ""urgent need for us to move forward in a bold cultural revolution."" Really? If so, how can we get there?\The great University of Chicago law professor Karl Llewellyn is reported to have said, ""Technique without morals is a menace; but morals without technique is a mess.""\At their best, economists are excellent technicians. They tell us how to achieve our preferred goals. And in so doing, they also turn out to be pretty decent moralists.\Lifting people out of poverty is a moral imperative. If economists can help us to find an efficient way to address environmental problems, including climate change, we will minimize adverse effects on growth, which is humanity's best way to reduce poverty and increase employment. Growth is often propelled by ""consumerism,"" which should not be treated as an evil.\It's true that any carbon tax or system of cap and trade would have to be tailored to national circumstances. A poor nation might not be able to handle a tax as high as one that would work well in France or Germany.\But pleas for ""a bold cultural revolution"" are unlikely to persuade leaders of the world's nations ccc rich or poor ccc to join such an agreement. What's needed is a demonstration that emissions limits really are in the interest of their people.\No one should question the encyclical's extraordinary moral clarity and powerful conviction. But with respect to technique, it's a bit messy.\Cass Sunstein, a Bloomberg View columnist, is director of the Harvard Law School's program on behavioral economics and public policy.\Credit: By Cass Sunstein Bloomberg View"
63,"
WASHINGTON -- By 2030, Illinois will feel like Arkansas now with longer and hotter summers -- but with more storms and unpredictable weather, climate researchers predict. By the end of the century, parts of the Midwest could be as steamy as Texas today.
\
""One thing we clearly know is that it will be a whole lot warmer, and the rainstorms probably not as gentle as when I was growing up on a farm in Carlyle, Ill.,"" said Donald Wuebbels, a climate researcher and director of the Director of School of Earth, Society and the Environment at the University of Illinois.
\
Wuebbels and other scientists will tune in this week for the release of a new international study that is expected to make the strongest link yet between the burning of fossil fuels and global warming.
\
The report will arrive on the heels of key developments in Washington that appear to build momentum for a national plan to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases. But despite a new push by congressional leaders and even a nod to the issue by President Bush, big battles are brewing, with powerful politicians likely to resist dramatic changes that would pain their constituents.
\
This week's study comes from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the main international body studying the issue. It represents the latest thinking from more than 2,000 of the world's leading scientists in what is billed as the largest scientific analysis of peer-reviewed literature ever. The report will analyze how the climate has changed over centuries and predict how it will change in the future.
\
Sources familiar with the study said last week that it will conclude that there's roughly a 90 percent certainty that most of the planet's warming since the mid-20th century can be traced to human activities.
\
The report also will affirm previous reports that glaciers are melting even more quickly than had been believed while fine-tuning predictions about how much oceans will rise in coming years, according to U.S. experts and leaked information. It will be released in Paris on Friday.
\
Experts say the findings will reinforce the widely held belief that the planet is rapidly warming, something 3 in 4 Americans already think, polls show.
\
""Mild winters or the lack of winter, melting glaciers -- these are the things that get people's attention and are driving the political system,"" said Vicky Arroyo, director of policy analysis at the nonpartisan Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Washington.
\
The new report will be embraced by some in Congress as further evidence of the need for mandatory limits on emissions from factories and cars, a highly contentious goal that will draw opposition from members with coal, oil and automotive interests in their districts.
\
An example is Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill., a member of the House Energy Committee. Shimkus said he would be looking for allies in both parties to help prevent undue damage to the Illinois coal industry.
\
""There were communities in Southern Illinois devastated by the Clean Air Act,"" he asserted. An aide to Shimkus later cited Pinckneyville as one of the Illinois towns that suffered because of a downturn in the coal industry that followed Clean Air Act amendments aimed at reducing the use of high-sulfur coal.
\
""The public as a whole thinks we ought to start addressing this issue, and you don't want to be the guy who blocks it,"" Shimkus said. ""But we need to ensure that as we move to address the global warming debate that we don't react so strongly that we shut down industries.""
\
The movement toward a full-fledged congressional debate, dormant as recently as late last year, picked up steam last week when an alliance of U.S. corporate leaders gathered in Washington to declare their support for new air pollution limits and a ""cap-and-trade"" system giving industries flexibility to comply.
\
Under cap-and-trade, companies have the right to buy and sell pollution rights within an overall limit decreasing over time.
\
The CEOs represented 10 companies that produce a host of products from heavy equipment to chemicals to electricity. They concluded that the scientific evidence about climate change and its causes is sound and that their industries need to make investments now to prepare for what was described as a ""carbon-constrained"" future.
\
The executives said they expected their alliance to grow and they were right: They won an early and significant endorsement of Wal- Mart, the world's largest retailer.
\
President George W. Bush has been skeptical of the link between rising planet temperatures and the burning of fossil fuels. But in his State of the Union address last week, he referred to ""the serious challenge of global climate change.""
\
Bush's main focus was energy security and reducing dependence on foreign oil. He proposed using more ethanol and promoting fuel efficiency to reduce gasoline consumption by 20 percent in ten years, a goal that also addresses climate change.
\
Even though the president did not embrace carbon emission limits or broader solutions, climate-change experts viewed his statement as another breakthrough.
\
""It is clear that the country is moving rapidly to some sort of national greenhouse gas emissions regimen, a dramatic shift accelerated by both the science and the elections,"" said Philip Sharp, president of Resources for the Future, a think tank in Washington that explores environmental and social topics.
\
Sharp, a former Democratic congressman from Indiana, says the battles shaping up now over global warming are similar to those in the late 1980s over acid rain.
\
In the years following Ronald Reagan's infamous assertion that ""trees cause more pollution than automobiles,"" Republicans and Democrats alike embraced the movement to reduce sulfur dioxide -- a pollutant from coal and oil and a main source of acid rain. Similarly, 2008 White House hopefuls in both major political parties are promising to aggressively fight global warming.
\
The issue became a protracted battle in Congress that pitted regions of the country against one another and split the Democratic Party, in control of Congress much of the time.
\
Then as now, Sharp recalled, the issue of how to limit damage to coal-producing areas was one of the toughest to deal with.
"
64,"Rep. Mike Noel, the Legislature's chief climate-change skeptic, declared Thursday that global warming is a conspiracy to control world population.\The House Natural Resources Committee then approved a resolution that expresses the Utah Legislature's belief that ""climate alarmists' carbon dioxide-related global warming hypothesis is unable to account for the current downturn in global temperatures.""\The resolution, sent to the House on a 10-1 vote, would urge the Environmental Protection Agency to drop plans to regulate the pollution blamed for climate change ""until a full and independent investigation of the climate data conspiracy and global warming science can be substantiated.""\""We're at the breaking point,"" said Rep. Kerry Gibson, the resolution's sponsor, who warned that the supply of safe and affordable food is already threatened by over-regulation.\Eleven Brigham Young University scientists defended climate science in a point-by-point rebuttal to parts of the resolution and urged the panel in an e-mail to reject the measure.\""Even if all the political solutions proposed so far are flawed,"" they said, ""this does not justify politicians attacking the science that indicates there is almost certainly a serious problem.""\The Utah Farm Bureau, a strong backer of the resolution, pressed many of the same scientists, along with LDS Church-owned BYU, to apologize for comments they had made critical of a previous legislative climate discussion and the remarks of one witness who disputes humankind's role in global warming.\""I would call on Brigham Young University and Summer Rupper to apologize for what they have said,"" said Farm Bureau CEO Randy Parker, who assisted Gibson, an Ogden farmer, in presenting the measure.\Both BYU and one of the scientists involved indicated Thursday there won't be an apology for comments regarding University of Alabama researcher Roy Spencer's work.\""We attacked some of his positions,"" said geochemist Barry Bickmore, who signed both BYU letters. ""We didn't attack him.""\BYU spokesman Michael Smart noted that the scientists who have written to the Legislature have said all along they do not represent the school's views.\""The faculty have always been clear they are speaking for themselves and not for the university,"" he said. ""The university doesn't take a position on this issue, so we don't have any comment on it.""\Parker, a member of the 2007 Governor's Blue Ribbon Advisory Council on Climate Change, and Gibson told the committee that climate science was motivated by the chase for research dollars, that climatology suffers a ""credibility crisis"" and that the work of skeptical scientists is being squelched.\They also described devastating impacts on the economy and farmers if the EPA succeeds with proposed regulation of carbon dioxide as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and if Congress enacts a ""cap-and-tax"" law.\""It would be crippling to the economy,"" said Gibson. ""What it comes down to is: Agriculture is being regulated and taxed to death under this kind of mentality.""\Parker said proposed policies would hit U.S. farmers and families hard, putting a $2,000 or greater burden on each family, trigger energy shortages and slash farm income by half. He also said the EPA's ""cow tax"" would cost Utah's farmers and ranchers nearly $104 million, although the agency insists the regulation would not apply to small businesses like farms.\Rep. Phil Riesen, D-Holladay, questioned Gibson about the ""conspiracy"" wording in the resolution. ""A conspiracy?"" he asked. ""By whom? To what end?""\""I'm not sure we'll ever know the depths of it,"" said Gibson, adding that it was hard to separate the hype because ""we only hear one side of the argument.""\Rep. Roger Barrus, R-Centerville, who supported the anti-regulation part of the resolution, called the wording ""pretty inflammatory"" and counter to the Legislature's standards of civility.\But Noel defended the ""conspiracy"" wording, pointing to an out-of-print textbook, Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment , written in the 1970s by biologist Paul Ehr - -lich, Ehrlich's wife, Anne, and physicist John Holdren about the potential hazards of unchecked population.\The Kanab Republican, referring to Holdren as the Obama administration's ""energy czar,"" read from passages of the 1,000-plus-page tome about population-control alternatives that included abortion and forced sterilization. He did not share the authors' conclusion: that voluntary population-limiting methods are ""a far better choice.""\""Now, if you can't see a connection [of a conspiracy] to that,"" the legislator said, ""you're absolutely blind to what is going on. This is absolutely -- in my mind, this is in fact a conspiracy to limit population not only in this country but across the globe.""\fahys@sltrib.com\Fact check of HJR12 points:\1. Proposed congressional legislation would cause ""significantly higher energy costs.""\Fact check - President Barack Obama has previously acknowledged that energy costs would ""skyrocket,"" although by how much ranges from an EPA estimate of $140 per family per year, to $1,500 a year, according to the conservative Heritage Foundation.\2. EPA action would create ""significant regulatory and financial burdens ... at a time when the nation's unemployment rate exceeds 10 percent.""\Fact check - EPA is waiting for Congress to pass a bill, rather than taking unilateral action. Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that up to 2.3 million jobs will be lost over 20 years under current proposals, while different jobs would also be lost if no legislation is passed.\3. Temperatures have been ""level and declining"" over the last 12 years.\Fact check - The World Meteorological Organization notes that temperatures can be explained ""partially"" by the strength of El Nino and La Nina. The BYU scientists also note that the recent, short-term trend is meaningless because climate change analysis -- as opposed to weather -- strictly concerns time periods 30 years or longer.\4. There is a ""more direct correlation"" between CFCs and temperature changes than there is for CO2, and that CFC regulations from the 1970s could explain the temperature decline listed above.\Fact check - According to the BYU scientists, this conclusion relies on a single paper published last year that contradicts thousands of scientific publications, which is ""as illogical as it is irresponsible.""\5. The emails hacked from various scientists, known as ""Climategate,"" show that there is ""a well organized and ongoing effort to manipulate"" temperature data.\Fact Check - The nonpartisan Factcheck.org said that the emails taken from the Climate Research Unit had been ""misrepresented,"" noting, for instance, that no group had relied only on the CRU, but also looked at statistics from groups like NASA. They also note that the infamous ""tricks"" the emails said scientists used were references to the now-discredited use of tree rings in analyzing temperature change, and not ""sneaky manipulations.""\6. Climate change ""alarmists"" have been involved in ""a concerted effort"" to prevent scientists who disagree with them from publishing their findings.\Fact check - The BYU scientists noted that sometimes the authors of rejected papers blame it on bias rather than ""carefully consider[ing] the potential flaws pointed out by the reviewers.""\7. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change does no independent research, instead relying on other, global climate researchers.\Fact check -The IPCC relies on a variety of scientists from around the world, including those at NASA. It could be noted that the Legislature does the same thing, relying on the work of outside scientists and not performing their own climate tests.\8. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, a ""little ice age"" occurred, reducing global temperatures. Increased temperatures today could be a normalization of temperatures after the extended period of low temperatures\Fact check - Some scientists maintain the Little Ice Age supports the belief that humans affect the climate, and that the decimated human population from the Black Plague and the Columbian Exchange led to the global cooling.\9. Scientists, relying on government grants, may be producing results to secure more money\Fact check - Assertion lacks citation of evidence in support.\10. The Copenhagen conference on climate was ineffective and would require the United States giving billions to developing countries.\Fact check - The conference did not result in any agreement that would make the United States compensate other countries.\11. ""Current legislation"" would damage America's ""food security and rural communities.""\Fact check - The U.S. Department of Agriculture (the organization cited in the resolution) supported climate change legislation in its most recent analysis of it last summer.\12. ""Global governance"" would ""lock billions of human beings into long-term poverty.""\Fact check - The resolution tries to tie poverty statistics from the World Health Organization to the dangers of global initiatives to combat climate change. This is misleading, because even though the statistics are accurate, the WHO never suggests the statistics are either caused by current climate change rules or that they would be made worse by international attempts to fight climate change. WHO is actually supportive of efforts to fight climate change, and suggests that climate change, if left unaddressed, could create more poverty and food shortages.\Sources:\1 - http://www.factcheck.org/2009/05/cap-and-trade-cost-inflation/\2 - http://epa.gov/climatechange/\http://www.factcheck.org/2009/10/cap-and-trade-green-jobs-or-job-killer/\http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/105xx/doc10573/09-17-Greenhouse-Gas.pdf\3 - http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/20/AR2009032003191.html\4 - http://www.epa.gov/ozone/title6/phaseout/hcfc.html\5 - http://www.factcheck.org/2009/12/climategate/\6 -- (not addressed yet)\7 -- (Common sense)\8 - http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1175%2FEI157.1&ct=1\9 -- (not addressed yet)\10 -- True\11 - http://www.usda.gov/oce/climate_change/index.htm\12 - http://www.who.int/topics/climate/en/\-- Christian Vanderhooft and Judy Fahys\Climate change resolution\Visit sltrib.com for a fact check of HJR12's list of assertions on climate change and the impact of proposed regulation.\Credit: By Judy Fahys The Salt Lake Tribune"
65,"Washington -\Salt Lake City Mayor Ralph Becker told a Senate panel Tuesday that Congress' move to limit industry pollution is a good start.\In testimony before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Becker said the nation needs to cut consumer vehicle exhaust in addition to capping pollution by companies, as proposed in the House-passed energy bill.\""The climate change issue to us is one that requires a comprehensive approach, one that is accomplished at all levels of government and one that looks at all sectors of the economy in our society,"" Becker said. ""The American Clean Energy and Security Act -- which passed the House, which certainly I commend and I know many others do -- really misses a key component from our point of view: the transportation sector.""\National efforts to curb global warming pollution must address the impact of individual vehicle emissions, Becker said.\He also said that in his experience, the more transit opportunities are available, the more people want to use those alternatives to driving.\""People want walkable communities,"" Becker said. "" They don't like being caught in congestion.""\Becker, who previously ran an environmental planning firm, spoke as part of a panel addressing transportation's role in climate change. The mayor's suggestions -- invest in more mass transit, encourage smarter land-use planning and boost alternative transportation, such as bike paths and carpooling -- found a welcome audience with fellow Democrats.\""We should make sure that, as we tell American businesses to get their houses in order, we clean up our act as well,"" said Sen.

66," (The writer is addressing the question, ""Will California's new limits on greenhouse gas emissions help the state's economy and reduce global warming?"")\ WASHINGTON - Arnold Schwarzenegger's decision to sign the first statewide, multi-industry greenhouse gas emission limits may be a calculated political move to burnish his green credentials in an attempt to get re-elected governor. Or it may symbolize his sincere belief that California should take a leadership role in reducing the threat of climate change.\ But whatever his motives, the results will be higher prices for California's consumers, higher unemployment for California's workers and little or no benefit for the environment.\ Taking the latter point first, California's law will require companies in selected industries to reduce their greenhouse emissions by whatever amounts, and by whatever methods, are deemed necessary by the California Air Resources Board in order to reduce emissions for the entire state by 25 percent by 2020 - equaling California's 1990 emission levels.\ While California is an economic powerhouse and these cuts are substantial, their effect on future climate will be nil. The National Center for Atmospheric Research reports that if all the signatories to the much more stringent Kyoto protocol - which would require industrialized countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 5 percent below 1990 levels - meet their reduction targets, the earth will be between 0.07 degrees Celsius and 0.19 degree Celsius cooler than it would be absent Kyoto.\ California's solo efforts to reduce global warming will be even less effective. California's wasted effort will, however, come with a high price tag. The regulations implementing California's climate bill have yet to be written, so no objective economic analysis of its effects are available.\ However, an analysis of a regional climate change action plan considered by 11 Northeastern states and the premiers of Canada's eastern provinces showed that even with an efficient cap-and-trade program similar to Schwarzenegger's proposal, both electricity and residential natural gas prices would rise by as much as 39 percent by 2020.\ The higher energy costs would result in consumption spending falling by an estimated average of $2,634 per household; gross state product would decline 1.1 percent; and an estimated 191,589 jobs would be lost by 2010.\ The study also found that as companies fled high fuel prices in the Northeastern states, employment in the rest of the United States would increase by more than 117,000 in 2010 and by an additional 59,000 in 2020. The effect of these changes also would be highly regressive since the poorest households spend more of their income on energy compared the wealthiest households.\ California's law will have similar economic costs. Many companies already have fled the state in recent years due to its poor business environment. California has a high tax burden, among the highest land values and home prices, requires employers to pay even unskilled workers relatively high wages, and it is ranked as having among the worst regulatory environments of any of the 50 states.\ In addition, Californians face some of the highest energy bills in the nation - which this law will only make worse. Proponents of the law argue that it will create new jobs through investments in, and the manufacturing of, new technologies. However, these gains will not be realized in California.\ Any new technologies designed to meet California's needs will likely be developed and built in other states or even other countries with less oppressive business climates and lower energy costs, then shipped to California.\ Only politicians could argue that raising the cost of doing business was actually good for business. California residents may yet be saved from this mess. The affected industries are considering challenging the law in court. If these challenges fail to materialize, or fail in court, Californians can expect more blackouts and higher unemployment, food and fuel prices. All in a good day's work for politicians from the left coast.\ ---\ H.

67,"
The fight against global warming is about to get more personal for Utahns, with Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. joining forces with California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
\
On Monday, Schwarzenegger will be in Utah as Huntsman signs the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative, a pact enacted earlier this year by Schwarzenegger and four other Western governors.
\
The agreement calls for an overall regional goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from all six states collectively and calls for a cap and trade program whereby emission credits could be sold. In addition, a tracking registry for emissions would be implemented.
\
Global warming has moved to the forefront of public debate recently, drawing red and blue states together in an effort to combat climate change -- which has been blamed for prolonged droughts, reduced snowpacks and more severe forest fires.
\
Huntsman's signing of the initiative is a bold move that sends a national message to conservatives that global warming demands attention, according to Dan Schnur, a political science instructor at the University of California Berkeley.
\
""This has the potential to be the energy version of Nixon going to China,"" Schnur said. ""A lot of cold warriors felt much more comfortable establishing relations with China once Nixon was on the issue. A governor like Huntsman from a state like Utah provides cover for conservatives in other places.""
\
Aaron McLear, press secretary to Schwarzenegger, said global warming is something that transcends partisan politics. ""This is more about being pro-environment, pro-economy, pro-national security and creating jobs,"" McLear said. ""I think this is a good thing for the people of Utah and California.""
\
Utah, which relies almost entirely on fossil fuels to generate its electricity, will become part of a pact that was signed in February by Schwarzenegger and the governors of Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington. British Columbia also has agreed to the pact.
\
Huntsman said he is less interested in what political slant one might put on the problem, instead expressing concern about taking steps toward a solution.
\
""I think most Americans and most Utahns are coming around to a view that we must take action,"" Huntsman said. ""All I know is that our air is less clean than it was in the past. We have more red days than ever before. We have water quality problems. These are issues that we all need to get behind.""
\
Dan Skopec, undersecretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, called Utah's signing of the initiative significant.
\
""For Gov. Huntsman to do this we recognize is a really bold move,"" Skopec said. ""Utah provides a lot of power to other states in the West. As you seek to reduce emissions at the state level, one of the big criticisms is that you get leakage -- people just move out of state and keep emitting and you haven't done anything to solve the climate problem. You can address the leakage issue when you have Utah joining this initiative.""
\
The Center for Climate Strategies -- a nonprofit group specializing in climate issues -- estimates that Utah's annual carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in 2005 totaled roughly 68.8 million metric tons, a 4 percent increase from 65.9 million metric tons in 2000 and a 40 percent increase compared to 1990, when state emissions totaled 49.3 million metric tons.
\
Jim Steenburgh, professor and chair of the Department of Meteorology at the University of Utah, said there is strong scientific consensus that Earth's climate is changing.
\
""There's no scientific doubt any longer that the Earth has warmed over the last 100 years,"" Steenburgh said. ""Particularly in the last 50 years the rate of warming has been accelerating.""
\
Carbon dioxide acts like glass in a greenhouse, allowing sunlight through to heat the planet's surface but trapping the heat as it radiates back into space, according to the Young Peoples Trust for the Environment.
\
""The levels that we have now, though, because of fossil fuel use are substantially higher than the natural levels of carbon dioxide over the last several hundred thousand years,"" Steenburgh said. ""We've basically added all of this carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and the planet is just beginning to respond, and the way it's responding is through warming.""
\
Huntsman's signing of the initiative, however, is largely symbolic. It will require more persuasion to put a plan in action in a state like Utah, where coal is abundant and electricity rates rank among the cheapest in the nation.
\
Last week, Rich Walje, president of Rocky Mountain Power, warned that potential federal and state mandates regulating carbon emissions could penalize Utahns more than citizens in other states.
\
But Huntsman downplays those concerns.
\
""We will have to move faster and more vigorously toward lessening our carbon footprint, and ultimately that is going to have to be carbon sequestration technology,"" Huntsman said. ""Those who want to wait on the development of that sequestration technology, they are probably going to find that we all have to move aggressively toward that end. And it means probably more in the way of investment in research and development.""
\
The initiative at this point is only policy and does not require that businesses, industry or consumers comply. That, Huntsman believes, will take some time and likely involve future legislation.
\
In the meantime, Huntsman said he will push for a state renewable energy standard, which will establish a minimum threshold of how much of the state's electrical energy generation comes from renewable sources like wind.
\
""Teddy Roosevelt came here in 1903 and had kind of a rally downtown, and his message was to thank the citizens for being good conservationists,"" Huntsman said. ""We were known at one time for being good conservationists, good stewards of the land. I think that is an ethos that is going to return.""

68,"Salina -\Coal is key to Utah's economy for at least the next generation, Gov. Gary Herbert said on a tour of the state's top power sources Friday.\At least, he said, it is if industry can clean it up.\Without reduced carbon emissions, he warned miners at the massive underground Sufco Mine, national political realities may drive up coal's costs, suppressing Utah's prospects. But he said he is confident the state's universities and regulators have a role in enabling clean-energy industries, including cleaner uses of coal.\""Frankly, we've got to find cleaner ways to have affordable energy,"" Herbert said after riding 8 & #189; miles into the side of a mountain here, where Arch Coal is grinding 3,000 or more tons a day. Otherwise the federal government likely will impose carbon costs, through a tax or other method.\The Sufco mine supplies nearby power plants and is the origin of roughly half of all electricity used in Utah. Together, Utah's coal mines and some in Colorado and Wyoming provide more than 80 percent of the power used in the state. It's an arrangement that makes Utah's electricity some of lowest costing in the nation -- less than 6.7 cents per kilowatt hour, compared to about 14 cents in California. But environmental and health advocates say the cheap energy isn't worth the prices paid downwind.\Renewable energy, while growing, accounts for single-digit percentages in Utah's energy portfolio, and mostly feeds California and other higher-priced regional markets.\Friday's tour was an early attempt at gathering ideas to put Herbert's recently released 10-year state energy plan into practice. The plan calls for market-driven development of everything from natural gas-fired electricity to wood-based gas and solar fields.\Critics have said it's not really a plan, because as yet it offers no clear price changer -- tax preferences for renewables, for instance -- but Herbert is backing a university-based initiative for innovation. He also backs coal as the great cost-reducer, and on Friday told Arch Coal officials that if it's in the state's cost interests, ""then, by golly, we ought to be burning more coal, but we ought to be concerned about the environment, too.""\""Coal, certainly for the next generation, has a role to play,"" the governor said later in an interview.\Here in south central Utah, coal's role is bedrock. Sufco alone has 385 employees, mostly living in the dusty service centers of Salina and Richfield. Some 280 local truckers haul 800 loads to Utah power plants and a rail yard at Levan daily. On Friday, they wound constantly though the Interstate 70 ranch exit interchange that accesses the mine.\There are thousands of coal miners in Utah, including about 900 working for St. Louis-based Arch Coal's three mines here. They make, on average, about $75,000, or $112,000 if you add in benefits, the company's regional president, Gene DiClaudio, told the governor.\Sufco, mined since 1941, probably has another 20 years of life, DiClaudio said. As its easier deposits are removed, though, it will require more engineering and become more expensive.\Deep in the mountain, long-wall mining foreman Clayton Dalton was monitoring the 1,000-foot apparatus that strips and ships coal from the seam. Long-wall mining uses computer-driven carbide rotors that churn a few feet of coal from the wall on each pass. The coal falls onto a wet conveyor belt and is sprayed for dust suppression, and Dalton and his crew watch the equipment.\They work in a mechanized cocoon about 25 feet wide and 15 feet high that runs the length of the coal wall. Tree-trunk-sized hydraulic jacks support a steel roof over them, and steel flaps hanging near the wall protect them from spraying coal shards as the grinder moves past. As the whole assemblage digs deeper into the wall, the hollowed space behind the miner collapses, and the mountaintop sags a little.\The ground beneath the miners' rubber boots is a mucky, gray sludge in their helmet lamp beams. The temperature is in the low 60s year-round.\""It's exciting work,"" Dalton, a 31-year Sufco veteran, shouted over the machinery's buzz. ""It's kind of like being a frontiersman. Nobody's ever walked here before. It's like walking on the moon.""\More than that, he said, it's work that ""keeps the world going.""\""I think it's the most important thing there is.""\It's no surprise that Herbert was quick to visit coal producers after releasing his plan this spring, said Utah State University political scientist Michael Lyons. It's politically safe in a conservative state that likes resource jobs, he said.\""It's very clearly designed to demonstrate support for the development of coal,"" Lyons said. ""It's not at all surprising that the governor would indirectly be endorsing the more intense use of coal to meet the energy needs.""\Lyon is skeptical that any state energy policy can make significant shifts in a market that's driven by international demand, though. It may be that Utah will move away from coal because that international demand, coupled with environmental costs, drives up fossil fuel costs and spurs alternative technologies, he said.\Idaho State University political scientist Robert Forbis, whose doctoral dissertation at the University of Utah focused on Western energy and the environment, said direct and indirect subsidies are part of what's keeping fossil fuels relatively cheap. If Congress would remove oil and gas development subsidies, he said, or impose a carbon tax or some system of capturing environmental costs, renewables would develop faster.\That's a tough sell when coal and oil companies have great political influence.\""These are powerful political lobbies,"" he said. ""They contribute heavily to both Republicans and Democrats.""\Herbert acknowledged ""soft costs"" of coal use, but said they're hard to quantify and don't justify a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system. Such measures just stifle innovation, he said.\Terry Marasco, of the Utah Clean Air Alliance, said his group submitted numerous health studies to the governor's planning team, but the plan did not reference their data on coal's health costs.\""Coal being the worst polluter, [that] tells the citizens that the government is more concerned about revenue than health issues,"" Marasco said.\Herbert also toured Rocky Mountain Power's Huntington coal-fired power plant, a customer for Sufco coal. The steam turbines there provided enough power for 666,000 homes last year, company officials told him.\After the tour, plant safety manager David Verdi said workers there face risks from pressurized systems, just like miners risk cave-ins, but he isn't sure customers fully appreciate it.\""Most of us just go into our office, turn on the lights, grind our coffee, think everything's OK,"" he said. ""I think we take it for granted.""\Is coal the state's future?\Credit: By Brandon Loomis The Salt Lake Tribune"
69,"As the world approaches a tipping point in the climate change crisis, many people finally appear to be waking up to the need for radical change, although the Trump administration is still pushing in the opposite direction.\Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, urged world leaders to come to New York with action plans, not fancy speeches, to deal with climate change. Before the U.N. Climate Action Summit, which began Monday, students around the world went on strike and scientists gathered to warn that climate change is hitting harder and sooner than they had originally predicted.\Dealing with climate change will require an ethical vision, solid science and good economic policies. The absence of any of these three could consign our response to failure.\The ethical vision is needed because any adequate response will require sacrifice, and people do not make sacrifices without motivation. Too many people alive today do not see the need for sacrificing their comfort to reduce climate change. Most will be dead before the worst happens. In addition, the worst impact will be on the poor, not the wealthy, whose money can mitigate the consequences of global warming.\Responding to climate change requires a moral vision that puts the poor and future generations on an equal footing with ourselves. A libertarian vision in which each person seeks his own advantage will not work. Common effort and common sacrifice for the common good are what is required.\Pope Francis said in his video message to the climate summit, “The problem of climate change is related to issues of ethics, equity and social justice.”\“With honesty, responsibility and courage, we have to put our intelligence at the service of another type of progress,” said the pope, “one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral, capable of placing economy at the service of the human person, building peace and protecting the environment.”\It was this moral sense that Greta Thunberg, the leader of the worldwide student strike, represented when she told the gathered leaders at the U.N., “If you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil, and that I refuse to believe.”\But the climate crisis will require not only an ethical vision but also a religious one. Throughout human history, religion has motivated people to do extraordinary things, sometimes bad but also good. The cathedrals of Europe were begun and mostly built by people who never saw their completion. How do you motivate someone to take the first shovel of dirt for a building that will not be completed for centuries?\Pope Francis, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of the Orthodox Christian Church, the Dalai Lama and many other religious leaders are attempting to lead their followers with a religious vision that is committed to taking on climate change. If the Earth is God’s creation, then abusing it is an offense against God.\If the Earth is an icon where we can see the face of God, then defacing it is a sacrilege. If we are all God’s children, then we must protect one another from harm. If you contribute to global warming, then you may be consigned to the fires of hell.\But an ethical and religious vision is insufficient without solid science. Science tells us what is causing global warming: CO2 and other greenhouse gases caused by human activity. Science tells us what the impact of global warming will be: melting ice caps and rising sea levels; melting glaciers and disruption of weather patterns and water supplies; disruption of agriculture; and extermination of millions of species of animals, plants and insects.\According to the latest report on climate change compiled by the U.N. World Meteorological Organization, “Widespread and long-lasting heat waves, record-breaking fires and other devastating events such as tropical cyclones, floods and drought have had major impacts on socioeconomic development and the environment.”\The WMO report “highlights the urgency of fundamental socio-economic transformations and carbon-curbing actions in key sectors such as land use and energy to avert dangerous global temperature increase, with potentially irreversible impacts.”\Science not only shows us how bad things are, it can also show us ways to reverse these trends. Changing how we travel, how we farm and what we consume can make a difference. Scientific research can also find new solutions that we have not even thought of.\But ethics and science will not be enough if the world’s economy is going in the wrong direction. We need good economic policies.\Tax and regulatory policies still subsidize the carbon-based economy. The oil, gas and coal lobbies fight to protect these subsidies that encourage the consumption of fossil fuels. Economists, on the other hand, tell us the best way to slow global warming is to put a tax on carbon. This would send a signal throughout the economy that it is in our financial interest to reduce our consumption of fossil fuels.\Gilbert Metcalf of the Brookings Institution argues that a well-designed carbon tax can actually boost jobs and gross domestic product, while reducing carbon emissions. He prefers a carbon tax to the more complicated and less effective “cap and trade” mechanisms espoused by those who are allergic to the word “tax.”\An initial rate of, say, $40 a ton of carbon dioxide emissions would provide price incentives for both consumers and businesses to reduce carbon consumption and invest in energy efficiency and clean sources of energy.\GM is closing plants that produce more efficient cars because with gas prices low, consumers prefer SUVs and trucks. If these plants had stayed open it might not have been hit by strikes.\An ethical vision, solid science and good economic policies are necessary if we are to save future generations and our planet from devastation. There is no time to spare.\The views expressed in this opinion piece do not necessarily reflect those of Religion News Service.\Crédito: By Thomas Reese Religion News Service"
70,"Washington -\Count Rep. Chris Stewart among the skeptics of climate change science and President Barack Obama's attempts to use federal regulations to curb carbon emissions.\That position puts Stewart, a freshman House member from Utah, well within the mainstream of Republican politics, but his views now hold more weight than those of many of his colleagues.\He's the new chairman of the House environmental subcommittee charged with overseeing the politically charged debate. Stewart leads his first hearing Wednesday focused on the Environmental Protection Agency and he has plans for more that will delve into potential federal actions in the name of climate science -- actions he worries may be too drastic and costly.\""I'm not as convinced as a lot of people are that man-made climate change is the threat they think it is,"" he told The Salt Lake Tribune . ""I think it is probably not as immediate as some people do.""\Stewart doesn't deny that the world's climate is warming, but he believes more research is needed to determine why.\He also believes policymakers need to examine the issue through a fiscal lens. He thinks Congress should take a three-step approach before taking action in the name of climate change, starting with a look at the science.\""What is the real threat? What are the economic impacts of those threats? And what are the economic impacts of those remedies?"" he asked, explaining his approach. ""Some of the remedies are more expensive to our economy than the threat may turn out to be.""\Stewart points to Obama's failed plan to cap carbon emissions for businesses and let them sell credits to bigger polluters. The House rejected the cap-and-trade plan in his first term, in part because estimates said it would result in a spike in utility bills for families.\--\EPA actions - Congress is no more likely to pass a major climate change bill now, though Obama has made it clear that he will use his power as president to fight to reduce carbon emission, largely through the EPA. Any such actions would likely come before Stewart's subcommittee.\Before joining Congress, Stewart ran the Shipley Group, a company that conducted environmental training and assessments to meet federal guidelines. He said that didn't make him an expert on environmental policy, but did give him a unique perspective into federal regulations that hampered businesses and regulations that protected vital lands.\Stewart's position on climate change didn't surprise Tim Wagner, with the Sierra Club of Utah, but it did irritate him.\""If he is overseeing a committee that is supposed to be based on science, but ignoring the science, it doesn't do much for his credibility,"" said Wagner. ""Unless he's trying to appeal to a specific industry, which is fossil fuels.""\Stewart's 2nd Congressional District includes the oil refineries in south Davis County. Donors associated with oil and gas contributed more than $40,000 to his 2012 campaign, his second highest total behind contributions from Republican officials, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\""I was elected based on my values and I work to represent my constituents in all that I do,"" said Stewart, who dismissed any suggestion that he bases policy decisions on campaign contributions.\A large majority of climate scientists agree that humans are contributing to climate change that is melting the polar ice caps and leading to a spike in volatile weather from more dangerous hurricanes to vast wildfires.\Wagner argues that if Stewart wants to examine the economic impacts he should start by looking at the damage Hurricane Sandy inflicted in New York and New Jersey or the fires that devoured homes in Colorado and Utah last summer.\""Those are real costs and if you ignore those, then you are ignoring your constituents,"" he said.\--\Political fight - Stewart says that the issue has become overly politicized with environmentalists using climate change as a justification for blocking projects that have little environmental downside but big economic upsides. As an example, he points to the proposed Keystone pipeline that would bring oil from Canada through the U.S. to refineries in the Gulf Coast. The federal government's own study found minimal environmental impacts, but groups like the Sierra Club fight the pipeline because they want to speed a move away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy sources to combat a warming climate.\""Look, that oil is going to go somewhere. It is going to go to market. Isn't it better that the oil would be refined in the U.S. where we have stricter environmental rules than in China or India?"" Stewart said.\Utah state Rep. Kraig Powell, R-Heber City, says climate change has turned into a proxy fight between environmentalists and the oil and gas industries and he calls for those involved, including Stewart, to approach the issue with an open mind.\Powell sponsored a bill this year that would have the Utah Legislature recognize climate change as human caused and allow land managers to take it into account when planning for wildfires. His bill went down in committee 11 to 4.\Afterward a few of his Republican colleagues told him he wasn't representing the party position and others argued that any efforts to combat climate change would be extremely costly and have minimal benefits.\""I think it behooves us to be willing to commission the studies, to listen to the experts and try to figure out what the evidence and data are showing,"" he said.\Stewart promises to do that, saying he'll ""let the science speak for itself.""\But at the same time he bristles at comments like one that Sally Jewell, Obama's nominee to lead the Interior Department, recently made before a Senate hearing. She said of climate change: ""There's no question in my mind that it is real and the scientific evidence is there to back that up.""\Stewart responded: ""I don't think that is true.

71,"Washington -\The curtain is about to rise on the second act of Barack Obama's presidency. On Monday, before an expected inaugural crowd of roughly 500,000 people, the president will trumpet his vision for a bold returnof the American economy. This president and the nation he leads have lived through too much tumult to expect the next four years to be free of unforeseen challenges and a few plot twists.\Still, the dawning of Obama's second term is a chance to reflect on what he has accomplished, what he dreams of doing in the months to come and what political insiders believe is actually achievable.\""I intend to carry out the agenda that I campaigned on -- an agenda for new jobs, new opportunity, and new security for the middle class,"" the president said in the last news conference of his first term. ""We are poised for a good year if we make smart decisions and sound investments -- and as long as Washington politics don't get in the way of America's progress.""\But what Obama may see as obstructionism, Republicans in Utah see as a chance to rein in the powers of an executive they disagree with, and they plan to be particularly obstinate when it comes to federal spending and the nation's ever-growing $16 trillion debt.\""Now we'll get to see if the president is really interested in being a leader or if he's just a good campaigner,"" GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch said in Utah this month. ""If he's a leader, he'll acknowledge reality and come to the table willing to cut spending and reform our entitlements. If he's only interested in being the Campaigner in Chief, he'll continue to call for tax hikes.""\The president said he's ready to talk about spending, but he also will argue for smaller cuts than Republicans want and new tax revenue that they will fight.\Rep. Jim Matheson, a conservative Democrat from Utah, said this struggle, which has dominated much of Obama's first term, is here to stay.\""The fiscal issues are not going to go away,"" he said. ""I think debt is a big part of what the president's second term is going to be about.""\How Obama handles that debate is likely to shift. Upon first taking office, the president spoke of changing the culture in Washington and ending gridlock. Now, after four years of relentless political skirmishes, he's taken a tougher negotiating stance with Congress.\The question remains whether it will help him achieve his vision to remake the economy or lead to passage of legislation on his other top priorities, which range from revamping the nation's immigration laws to curtailing gun violence. Here's a look at some of the key issues that Obama is likely to confront, in addition to the economy.\Immigration - Obama's second term may offer the perfect opening to tackle immigration reform in a comprehensive way, and he'll likely get a helping hand from Republicans who had stridently opposed such efforts during the past decade.\In fact, after Congress failed to pass the Dream Act, Obama had to turn to using his executive powers to help stop the deportation of young immigrants who were brought to the country illegally. This term, all signs point to bipartisan collaboration on wider legislation.\With demographic shifts showing more Latino voting power, observers suggest Republicans must accept some type of reform on immigration laws to clear a path to citizenship, or at least legal status, for the 11 million to 15 million illegal immigrants in the country already.\""Now, because of the election and because of the demographics, the hard-liners in the GOP have little or no incentive to resist this reform,"" said Dan Kowalski, an immigration lawyer and editor of Bender's Immigration Bulletin, an online news site.\While not ready to accept an amnesty program, Utah's Republican senators, Hatch and Mike Lee, have already begun work on potential bills to ease some immigrants' access to legal residency.\Gun control - Just last week, Obama launched an initiative on controlling gun violence: a multi-pronged plan that is likely in for a grueling fight in the first few months of his second term.\""In the days ahead, I intend to use whatever weight this office holds to make them a reality,"" Obama said before signing several directives aimed at doing what he can without Congress.\But to bar high-capacity magazines, mandate background checks for all gun sales and prohibit assault rifles, it'll take legislation, and that's where Obama is likely to spend considerable political capital, fighting the likes of the National Rifle Association.\Entrenched Republicans aren't about to waiver on those issues and some NRA-friendly Democrats, like Matheson, are unlikely to side with the president. Obama may prevail on some initiatives -- such as stricter background checks, as the NRA has signaled support -- but others may stall.\Energy and environment - With the coming departure of Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, Obama has a new chance to guide policy on the environment and public lands, though no one is expecting he can push any major legislation through a deeply divided Congress.\It could be a repeat, in some ways, of his first term.\Obama's first drive for climate-change legislation -- a cap-and-trade effort -- flailed even when Democrats held both chambers and was dead on arrival once Republicans took over the House. An Interior Department effort to bypass Congress on designating new wilderness, through a policy called ""wild lands,"" ended up being curtailed after significant blowback.\""It just showed inexperience that the administration had of how you make big things happen,"" said Frank Maisano, a senior principal at the law firm of Washington-based Bracewell & Giuliani who consults on energy and environmental issues. ""That has hindered their ability to do anything like that down the road.""\Instead, Obama and Interior turned to using regulatory power to push through environmental changes, a move he's likely to repeat during the next four years.\One thing Maisano believes Obama will do in his second term: Allow more on- and off-shore drilling, something Republicans have made hay of the past four years.\""He just has to do that, because he's not a dummy,"" Maisano said. ""He's going to get on the train in the direction it's moving.""\Health care - Obama's victory in the U.S. Supreme Court and the election ended Republicans' persistent attempts to eliminate his health-reform program, dubbed Obamacare, and now his administration has four years to implement the program. Its success, or failure, will play a major part in this president's legacy.\State leaders face big decisions in 2013. They must agree to manage a new online insurance portal for people who don't get coverage through their job, or let the feds do it. And they must accept or reject an expansion of Medicaid to cover low-income adults. Both the portal and Medicaid expansion kick in at the start of 2014, as do consumer protections that stop insurance companies from denying coverage or charging more because of a health factor.\So far Republican Utah Gov. Gary Herbert has continued negotiating with the Obama administration over the insurance portal, making repeated calls for state flexibility. Utah already created its own insurance exchange, known as Avenue H, but the feds say it does not yet meet the new law's requirements.\Herbert has been silent on the Medicaid expansion, though Nevada and Arizona have accepted the program along with the millions in federal money and restrictions that come with it.\The foreign perspective - Obama ended the Iraq War in his first term and plans in 2014 to oversee the conclusion of the war in Afghanistan, this nation's longest conflict. But that won't allow the U.S. to pivot its attention away from the Middle East.\The nuclear ambitions of Iran loom over the region and, in reaction, Israel has increasingly threatened a military response. Egypt continues to try to remake itself after its Arab Spring revolution. Civil war rages on in Syria.\Second-term presidents often turn increased attention to foreign affairs, particularly when the race to pick their successors heats up. Beyond the Middle East, Obama has tried to position himself as the first ""Pacific president,"" creating stronger financial and diplomatic ties in the Asian world, particularly with China.\mcanham@sltrib.com\tburr@sltrib.com\Obama's Act Two: What's in store\Obama Act 2: 4 more years, 6 vital issues\Credit: By Matt Canham And Thomas Burr The Salt Lake Tribune"

Universal health care is -- and always has been -- available for free. It's called diet and exercise. Many who take care of themselves and eat right can go decades without needing serious medical care. A plan that would motivate people to take care of themselves is what is needed. Forget cap and trade on the environment and apply it to health. The more you weigh, the more you pay. Allow insurance companies to risk-manage their clientele the same way auto insurers do. The better your physical condition, the less you pay.

73,"Lehi -\The part of Utah's economy that depends on agriculture would be hobbled if the government increases pressure on greenhouse-gas emissions, a panel warned Utah's farmers and bankers.\Randy Parker, Utah Farm Bureau president, said a ""cow tax"" the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is proposing would cost Utah livestock managers $104 million a year. The government would assess a $175-per-cow fee to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.\If the rule were in place, Utah ranchers and hog farmers would only have made $92 million in 2007.\""And that was a good year,"" Parker said during the 2010 Ag Outlook conference sponsored by the Utah Bankers Association and Utah State University Extension Service.\""If you look at 2008-2009, it is a lot worse.""\Parker was joined by Department of Agriculture Commissioner Leonard Blackham; David Conine , U.S. Department of Agriculture Regional Rural Development Director; and Roberta Wheeler, an officer with the Farm Loan Service.\Parker said climate-change regulations, including the cap-and-trade bill that would limit carbon emissions, hits agriculture particularly hard since farmers work in an energy-intensive industry.\The regulation would drive up costs to produce and buy food, as well as affect the national food supply, Parker warned.\""Do we really want to rely on China, Mexico, India, Brazil and other nations to supply our basic needs?"" Parker asked.\Conine said there is reason to be skeptical of global-warming claims, but farms cannot dismiss it either.\""If we don't address [climate change], it will affect agriculture,"" Conine said.\Blackham said that farming, and livestock in particular, already help Utah's environment. Grazing cattle control sagebrush and spur grass growth where they feed, which in turn helps other wildlife.\""If you want to find the best wildlife, look for the livestock,"" Blackham said.\Plus, farming is a major part of the Utah economy.\While farming alone only represents 3 percent of the state's economy, Blackham said the number increases almost five times when related industries such as food processing are considered.\dmeyers@sltrib.com\Credit: By Donald W.

74,"Even for people who don't believe in it, climate change just got real. It's about time.\The Obama administration's proposed new rule for existing power plants -- reducing heat-trapping carbon emissions by up to 30 percent by 2030 -- is ambitious enough to get anyone's attention. No, this one measure will not halt or reverse human-induced warming of the atmosphere. But the rule is necessary in the context of seeking international consensus on solutions.\Before Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy could announce the new rule Monday, critics were already bellowing about higher energy rates and lost jobs. They pretended not to see that President Obama -- as with health care reform -- is taking what ought to be seen as a Republican-friendly approach.\The rule, which will not become final until next year, gives states great flexibility in how they reach the target. They are not forced to immediately begin shutting down the aging coal-fired power plants that constitute one of the biggest sources of carbon pollution. Rather, each state can take the path that best fits its circumstances -- ramping up the generation of energy from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, for example, or entering regional cap-and-trade agreements.\Ultimately, however, hundreds of those aging, dirty, coal-fired plants will have to close. If the planet could speak, it would say good riddance.\The big unanswered question isn't scientific; it's political: Will we continue to turn up the thermostat?\Obama's major energy initiatives -- higher fuel economy standards for vehicles, plus the new power plant emissions rule -- will mean billions of tons less of carbon dioxide in the air. It is true that we cannot save the planet on our own. But it is also true that if warming-induced disaster is inevitable, it will arrive sooner if we fail to act.\Chinese and Indian universities are full of scientists who are warning their own governments about the negative impacts of carbon emissions. China has already signaled its intention to move away from coal, and while this is easier said than done, Chinese officials have an added incentive: The noxious smog that shrouds major cities, most of it from coal-fired power plants, has stoked real anger among the country's burgeoning urban middle class. In other industrializing countries as well, as people get richer they will demand a cleaner environment.\Obama hopes that action by the U.S., the richest country in the world, will make it possible for the other big carbon emitters to act.\The bonus is that closing coal-fired power plants will encourage the development of cleaner energy sources. The power generation industry was already moving toward cheap, plentiful natural gas, which releases much less carbon. Gas should be seen as a bridge toward clean, renewable energy sources -- an industry that will be huge in the 21st century.\It's our choice. We can try our best to ensure that the next industrial revolution -- the one that ends dependence on fossil fuels -- happens here. Or we can watch it happen in China.\Eugene Robinson's email address is eugenerobinson@washpost.com.\Eugene\Robinson\Washington Post"

While Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. is considered by many to be a moderate, progressive Republican, current Lt. Gov. Gary Herbert, who is soon to be governor, is believed to be more conservative in his views, including hot-button issues like civil rights and the environment.
\
That has left people on both sides of the political spectrum, including activists and elected officials, wondering what direction a Herbert administration could take the state.
\
Chief among those is the climate-change debate, which Huntsman was considered progressive on, even within the national GOP. Part of that agenda was membership in the Western Climate Initiative, a collaboration of seven U.S. states and four Canadian provinces that was formed in 2007 to mitigate the issue of climate change. A core component of the WCI is a market-based cap-and-trade system.
\
Whether the state's new chief executive continues that trend is questionable, said Sen. Scott McCoy, D-Salt Lake.
\
""I don't know that Herbert necessarily has that much of an environmental track record to look at and compare,"" McCoy said. ""My guess is that a Herbert administration would not be as progressive as a Huntsman administration was on environmental issues.""
\
McCoy said that Herbert's ties to the Utah County GOP would give him the impression that Herbert might lean a bit further right on issues.
\
""I have a gut feeling that Herbert isn't going to ... plow the rough ground that Huntsman was on the climate-change issue,"" he said. ""Maybe a Gov. Herbert would surprise me -- and it would be a pleasant surprise.""
\
Though he said it is too early to tell how Herbert would approach the climate-change issue, Sen. Howard Stephenson, R-Draper, who is also president of the pro-business Utah Taxpayers Association, said he believes Herbert understands the idea that the state needs ""a tax climate that is conducive to economic expansion.""
\
Another distinct difference between Huntsman and fellow Republicans, including Herbert, was allowing civil unions. McCoy said be believes Herbert would be ""much further to the right"" on the matter than Gov. Huntsman was, but he remains cautiously optimistic.
\
""I'm hopeful that a Gov. Herbert would maintain the same kind of open door that Gov. Huntsman maintained ... and replicate the open mind that Gov. Huntsman clearly had when it came to a whole host of issues.""
\
The executive director of Equality Utah, the state's largest civil-rights organization for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, told the Deseret News that he too is hopeful that his group will be able to create a positive working relationship with the new governor similar to the one they have with the outgoing administration.
\
""Although we've had no real working relationship with (Herbert) at this point, we don't really have a gauge to determine what that may be like,"" Mike Thompson said.

80,"Utah and the West could see the kind of investment that California's Silicon Valley enjoyed during its technology revolution if Congress establishes a national renewable energy standard, bill supporters said Tuesday.\Sponsored by Rep. Thomas Udall, D-N.M., and Rep. Todd Platts, R-Pa., H.R. 969 would require most utilities nationwide to produce 20 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020.\Democratic leaders could bring the bill to the House floor next week, perhaps as an amendment to another piece of legislation.\That's why ""it's crunch time in Congress,"" Lawson LeGate, the Sierra Club's senior southwest regional representative, said Tuesday during a meeting with The Salt Lake Tribune editorial board.\LeGate cautioned, however, that his organization didn't want to see watered-down legislation that fails to activate a meaningful renewable energy standard, which supporters say would curb global warming, protect the environment, lower consumer energy bills and spur economic development.\A 20 percent renewable standard could mean $45 billion in capital investment and 13,000 new, permanent jobs in Utah due to the state's tremendous potential for solar, wind and geothermal development, said John O'Donnell, president of Ausra, Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif.-based solar technology developer.\While LeGate said the renewable standard bill is proving a tougher slog than it should be, 2nd District Rep. Jim Matheson said competing bills on renewable standards have made the debate more complex. \A renewable standard bill already has failed in the Senate. Other House measures could focus on carbon cap and trade schemes that would provide market-based incentives to develop renewables, Matheson said.\Another complication: Some Eastern states, such as Virginia, have few renewable resources to develop. Requiring them to meet a 20 percent renewable standard could be unrealistic, said Matheson, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\Matheson's constituents support efforts to address global warming, according to a poll by the Natural Resources Defense Council released Monday. The survey showed 2nd District voters identify climate change as the nation's most pressing environmental problem and that immediate action is needed to address it.\More than 80 percent of the survey respondents said there should be incentives for energy conservation, more energy-efficient appliances, tougher vehicle emission standards and expansion of alternative energy use.\Already, 23 states have enacted their own renewable energy standards, also known as renewable energy portfolios. Last month, Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. announced he would pursue a renewable portfolio standard for Utah. Advocates for a federal standard say it could help streamline plans for new transmission capacity and boost research and development of non-fossil fuel energy.\A 2006 study commissioned by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado found that investing in commercial-scale solar power plants in California showed greater returns in economic activity and employment than similar investment in natural gas equipment.\During the annual Western Governors Association meeting in June, O'Donnell and other industry representatives said capital investment would be hard to come by unless all levels of government pitched in as full partners. Without policy change and financial incentives, renewable technologies can't be developed to commercial scale.\The governors, however, indicated they'd rather focus on clean-coal technology than new renewable energy research.\Credit: By Patty Henetz The Salt Lake Tribune"
81,"Love it or hate it, the Green New Deal certainly has generated plenty of excitement.\Except, that is, among Nevada's congressional delegation, which has kept mostly mum on the ambitious, green energy-fueled public works plan.\The proposal — spearheaded by insurgent progressive U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York — seeks to combat both growing income inequality and the worst effects of climate change with a massive, potentially multitrillion-dollar job creation program.\It's modeled after former President Franklin Roosevelt's famed New Deal, another sprawling, government-funded effort that put millions of people back to work building roads, bridges, buildings and dams during the Great Depression.\Ocasio-Cortez's measure seeks to achieve a similar aim by hiring workers to build expansive green energy projects, such as smart power grids, high-speed railroads and underground carbon storage centers.\A 14-page resolution outlining the plan reads more like a manifesto than finished legislation. Still, it picked up 68 sponsors in the House early this month. A Senate version of the measure has already won support from six of 10 announced Democratic presidential candidates.\But Republicans, and no shortage of Democrats, have also been quick to pan the proposal as a ""radical"" and ""impractical"" effort that could spike inflation and bring the economy to a grinding halt. They prefer more market-driven efforts, such as carbon taxes or a cap-and-trade system that would require polluters to obtain permits for their emissions.\You might expect Democrats in Nevada, touted as the ""Saudi Arabia of solar energy,"" to rally around a government effort that promises to plow piles of new cash into the state's burgeoning renewable energy sector.\Yet the Silver State's representatives on Capitol Hill have been nothing if not cautious. None of Nevada's six congressional delegates have signed on to the plan. Only three responded to the Reno Gazette Journal's questions about the measure.\The first was recently elected U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., who said she wanted to see a more detailed proposal before making up her mind.\""I still think they're trying to figure out all the exact details,"" Rosen told the Reno Gazette Journal after a Monday stop in Reno, ""but what we have to do is think about our planet, think about our environment and what's going to move us forward in each one of our communities.""\Rosen didn't directly answer a question about what she didn't like about the proposal, instead reiterating that the plan was still in its early stages.\""Everyone's having a lot of discussions right now,"" she said.\""When it takes a little bit more form, then I'm glad to comment on it.""\U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., struck an even quieter note.\""The senator is currently reviewing the resolution and looks forward to hearing from Nevadans on this important legislation,"" Masto said in a statement from a spokesman. ""I'll let you know when we have more updates.""\U.S. Rep. Mark Amodei, Northern Nevada's lone congressman and the only Republican in the state's congressional delegation, sounded equally wary of the resolution.\""With the Senate majority leader planning to bring this legislation up for a vote, we'll see if it gains any traction,"" he said in a statement from a spokeswoman.\""If it ends up being something the House might actually consider, I'd plan on taking a deeper dive into the bill to determine how these policy reforms would affect Nevadans and others across the country.""\The measure's cool reception among Nevada lawmakers largely echoes the response it won from moderate Democrats around the country.\House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., stopped well short of endorsing the effort after it was first introduced, but said in a press conference that she welcomed the ""enthusiasm"" surrounding the proposal.\U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, last week told CNN the proposal was more like ""a dream"" than an actual deal.\Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, was quick to pounce on the apparent Democratic discord, announcing plans to bring the Green New Deal up for a floor vote expected to accomplish little beyond inflaming existing ideological tensions in the Senate's minority caucus.\Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has slammed the promised vote as a ""cynical stunt.""\U.S. Sen.

""There was a whole lot more in there that was basically junk.""\Hatch said any fix for the economy must focus on four essential items - Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security and energy.\""These are big-time costs that are getting out of control,"" he said.\Hatch said he was afraid the administration and the Democratically-controlled Congress would be able to institute a federally-controlled health care system, and he is worried about the prospect of a cap-and-trade system on carbon emissions, which he said would not help the environment enough to make up for the effect it would have on American businesses.\""If they pass that, we're talking about making us uncompetitive with the rest of the world,"" he said.\Hatch, who holds high-ranking positions on multiple committees within the Senate, said he has personally been impressed by Obama and members of his staff, and would like to see bipartisan solutions, but he can't see himself supporting the current direction the administration is taking.\""I personally like Obama,"" he said. ""I personally want him to succeed. But I do not want him to succeed at being wrong."""

84,"Brigham Young University and a group of its earth scientists ought to apologize to a state lawmaker and a climate-change contrarian invited to Utah as an expert witness last year, says the Utah Farm Bureau.\Randy Parker, chairman of the farm group, said Thursday that BYU paleoclimatologist Summer Rupper and her university owe apologies to Rep. Mike Noel and Roy Spencer of Alabama, the climate researcher the Kanab Republican invited.\He was making a presentation on behalf of Rep.

""We didn't attack him.""\Gibson, flanked by Parker, told how Washington proposals to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions and begin a cap-and-trade program would devastate Utah's economy and its farmers.\""What it comes down to is agriculture is being regulated and taxed to death under this kind of mentality,"" said Gibson, who wondered whether the federal policies someday could cut Utah farm profits in half.\Parker fleshed out the thinking behind Gibson's legislation with a critique of climate science and the call on the BYU scientists and their school to apologize.\""They're reviewing the literature, but I'd like to know if they are doing cutting-edge research like Dr. Spencer is on some of the things that may in fact have an impact"" on climate change, Parker said. ""I guess the bottom line here, from my perspective, is science is an open process of ongoing research and debate, and a group of scientists should not make these kinds of statements about another scientist and about the chairman who invited them here.""\Eighteen BYU earth scientists wrote to Noel's Interim Committee on Public Utilities and Technology last fall a few days after Spencer, an author and researcher at the University of Alabama, testified about his work and explained why he thinks the generally accepted understanding of climate-change science is wrong and compromised by politics and greed.\Spencer said, during his Oct. 16 testimony, that his work on the impacts of clouds on climate had not been accepted by a peer-reviewed journal.\The 18 scientists, including Rupper, wrote to the interim committee a few days later to take lawmakers to task for putting too much weight on ""fringe positions,"" considering that more than 97 percent of active climate scientists and the world's major scientific societies agree that humans are accelerating climate change with excessive greenhouse-gas emissions.\They also noted that it was ""patently false"" that scientists had ignored the impact of natural climate cycles, as Spencer testified, and that lawmakers should rely on the best-available science in making policy decisions.\BYU spokesman Michael Smart noted that the 18 scientists who signed the October letter have said all along they do not represent the university's views.\""The faculty have always been clear they are speaking for themselves and not for the university,"" he said. ""The university doesn't take a position on this issue, so we don't have any comment on it.""\Eleven BYU biologists and earth scientists wrote to the Natural Resources Committee on Wednesday to urge them to table Gibson's resolution, based on numerous errors in the resolution's scientific conclusion. Its signers note that some of them personally agree the EPA regulations are not the best solution.\""Even if all the political solutions proposed so far are flawed,"" they wrote, ""this does not justify politicians in attacking the science that indicates there is almost certainly a serious problem.""\fahys@sltrib.com\Credit: By Judy Fahys The Salt Lake Tribune"

WASHINGTON -- Intelligent people agree that, absent immediate radical action regarding global warming, the human race is sunk. That is a tautology because those who do not agree are, definitionally, unintelligent. Britain's intelligent Prime Minister Gordon Brown gives scary precision to the word ""immediate."" By his reckoning, humanity now has about 30 days to save itself. He says that unless a decisive agreement is reached at the 192-nation summit on climate change that opens Dec. 7 in Copenhagen, all is lost.
\
So, all is lost. The chances of a comprehensive and binding treaty are approximately nil.
\
The fourth of five parlays preparing for Copenhagen occurred in Bangkok from Sept. 28 through Oct. 9, with delegates from about 180 nations participating. Remember diplomat George Kennan's axiom that the unlikelihood of reaching an agreement is the square of the number of parties at the table? The meeting adjourned with, as usual, essentially no progress toward an agreement on reduced emissions by developed nations or on the money such nations should pay to finance developing nations' efforts against global warming.
\
The New York Times reports that ""the United Nations Adaptation Fund, which officially began operating in 2008 to help poor countries finance projects to blunt the effects of global warming, remains an empty shell, largely because rich nations have failed to come through with the donations they promised."" The fund has a risible $18 million, which might not cover the cost of Copenhagen conference.
\
There they will experience more futility because of, among other things, two stubborn facts -- the two most populous nations. On Oct. 21, China, the world's leading emitter of greenhouse gases, and India, which ranks fourth -- together they account for 26 percent of emissions -- jointly agreed: They, with their combined one-third of the world's population, will not play in what increasingly resembles a global game of climate-change charades. Neither nation is interested in jeopardizing its economic growth with emission caps of a sort that never impeded the growth of the developed nations that now praise them.
\
But do not really embrace them. Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives took time out from fending off the world and exempted large cattle, dairy and hog producing operations from an Environmental Protection Agency requirement for reporting greenhouse gas emissions. And 13 Great Lakes cargo ships were exempted from a proposed mandate requiring the use of low-sulfur fuel. When constituents' interests conflict with global grandstanding, Congress' rule is ""act locally, think globally tomorrow, maybe.""
\
In their new book, ""SuperFreakonomics,"" Steven D. Levitt, a University of Chicago economist, and Stephen J. Dubner, a journalist, worry about global warming but revive some inconvenient memories of 30 years ago. Then intelligent people agreed (see above) that global cooling threatened human survival. It had, Newsweek reported, ""taken the planet about a sixth of the way toward the Ice Age average."" Some scientists proposed radical measures to cause global warming -- for example, covering the arctic ice cap with black soot that would absorb heat and cause melting.
\
Levitt and Dubner also spoil some of the fun of the sort of the ""think globally, act locally"" gestures that are liturgically important in the church of climate change. For example, they say the ""locavore"" movement -- people eating locally grown foods from small farms -- actually increases greenhouse gas emissions. They cite research showing that only 11 percent of such emissions associated with food are in the transportation of it; 80 percent are in the production phase and, regarding emissions, big farms are much more efficient.
\
Although the political and media drumbeat of alarm is incessant, a Pew poll shows that only 57 percent of Americans think there is solid evidence of global warming, down 20 points in three years. Gallup shows that only 1 percent of Americans rank the environment as their biggest worry. Two reasons are:
\
They are worried about their wages, which will not be improved by clobbering a weak economy with the costs of a cap-and-trade carbon-reduction regime. And climate Cassandras are learning the wages of crying ""Wolf!""
\
In 2005, global warming worriers warned, as they tend to do after all adverse or anomalous environmental events, that Hurricane Katrina was caused by global warming and foreshadowed an increase in the number and destructiveness of hurricanes. As this year's Atlantic hurricane season ends, only three hurricanes have formed -- half the average of the last 50 years -- and none have hit the United States.

WASHINGTON -- Barack Obama's considerable political capital, earned on Election Day 2008, is spent. Well-spent, mind you, on the enactment of a highly ideological agenda of Obamacare, financial reform and a near trillion-dollar stimulus that will significantly transform the country. But spent nonetheless. There's nothing left with which to complete his social-democratic ambitions. This would have to await the renewed mandate that would come with a second inaugural.
\
That's why, as I suggested last week, nothing of major legislative consequence is likely to occur for the next 2 1/2 years. Except, as columnist Irwin Stelzer points out, for one constitutional loophole: a lame-duck Congress called back into session between the elections this November and the swearing-in of the 112th Congress next January.
\
Leading Democrats are already considering this as a way to achieve even more liberal measures that many of their members dare not even talk about, let alone enact, on the eve of an election in which they face a widespread popular backlash to the already enacted elements of the Obama-Pelosi-Reid agenda.
\
That backlash will express itself on Election Day and result, as most Democrats and Republicans currently expect, in major Democratic losses. It is still possible for the gaffe-happy Republicans to blow it. When the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee publicly apologizes to the corporation that unleashed the worst oil spill in American history, you know the Republicans are capable of just about anything.
\
But assuming the elections go as currently projected, Obama's follow-on reforms are dead. Except for the fact that a lame-duck session, freezing in place the lopsided Democratic majorities of November 2008, would be populated by dozens of Democratic members who had lost re-election (in addition to those retiring). They could then vote for anything -- including measures they today shun as the midterms approach and their seats are threatened -- because they would have nothing to lose. They would be unemployed. And playing along with Obama might even brighten the prospects for, say, an ambassadorship to a sunny Caribbean isle.
\
As John Fund reports in The Wall Street Journal, Sens. Jay Rockefeller, Kent Conrad and Tom Harkin are already looking forward to what they might get passed in a lame-duck session. Among the major items being considered are card check, budget-balancing through major tax hikes, and climate-change legislation involving heavy carbon taxes and regulation.
\
Card check, which effectively abolishes the secret ballot in the workplace, is the fondest wish of a union movement to which Obama is highly beholden. Major tax hikes, possibly including a value-added tax, will undoubtedly be included in the recommendations of the president's debt commission, which conveniently reports by Dec. 1. And carbon taxes would be the newest version of the cap-and-trade legislation that has repeatedly failed to pass the current Congress -- but enough dead men walking in a lame-duck session might switch and vote to put it over the top.
\
It's a target-rich environment. The only thing holding the Democrats back would be shame, a Washington commodity in chronically short supply. To pass in a lame-duck session major legislation so unpopular that Democrats had no chance of passing it in regular session -- after major Democratic losses signifying a withdrawal of the mandate implicitly granted in 2008 -- would be an egregious violation of elementary democratic norms.
\
Perhaps shame will constrain the Democrats. But that is not to be counted on. It didn't stop them from pushing through a health care reform the public didn't want by means of ""reconciliation"" maneuvers and without a single Republican vote in either chamber -- something unprecedented in American history for a reform of such scope and magnitude.
\
How then to prevent a runaway lame-duck Congress? Bring the issue up now -- applying the check-and-balance of the people's will before it disappears the morning after Election Day. Every current member should be publicly asked: In the event you lose in November -- a remote and deeply deplorable eventuality, but still not inconceivable -- do you pledge to adhere to the will of the electorate and, in any lame-duck session of Congress, refuse to approve anything but the most routine legislation required to keep the government functioning?
\
The Democrats could, of course, make the pledge today and break it tomorrow. Call me na?e, but I can't believe anyone would be that dishonorable.

LONDON -- The chief of a prestigious British research center caught in a storm of controversy over claims that he and others suppressed data about climate change has stepped down pending an investigation, the University of East Anglia said Tuesday.
\
The university said in a statement that Phil Jones, whose e-mails were among the thousands of pieces of correspondence leaked to the Internet late last month, would relinquish his position as director of Climatic Research Unit until the completion of an independent review.
\
The university's Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Research Trevor Davies said the investigation would cover data security, whether the university responded properly to Freedom of Information requests, ""and any other relevant issues."" The statement said the specific terms of the review will be announced later in the week.
\
Jones has been accused by skeptics of man-made climate change of manipulating data to support his research.
\
In particular, many have pointed to a leaked e-mail in which Jones writes that he had used a ""trick"" to ""hide the decline"" in a chart detailing recent global temperatures. Jones has denied manipulating evidence and insisted his comment had been misunderstood, explaining that he'd used the word trick ""as in a clever thing to do.""
\
Nicholas Stern, a leading climate change economist, said the person or people who posted the leaked e-mails had muddled the debate at a critical moment.
\
Davies said there was nothing in the stolen material to suggest the peer-reviewed publications by the unit ""are not of the highest-quality of scientific investigation and interpretation.""
\
But the correspondence from Jones and others -- which appears to include discussions of how to keep critical work out of peer-reviewed journals and efforts to shield scientists' data and methodology from outside scrutiny -- have been seized upon by those who are fighting efforts to impose caps on emissions of carbon dioxide as evidence of a scientific conspiracy.
\
Sen. James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican and a vocal skeptic of global warming, called Tuesday for Senate hearings on the e-mails. In a letter to Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who chairs the environment committee, Inhofe said the e-mails could have far-reaching policy implications for the United States. Both Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency are taking action to curb global warming based on a report that uses data produced by the Climate Research Unit.
\
A House committee has scheduled a hearing Wednesday on the status of climate science. Two prominent Obama administration scientists -- White House science adviser John Holdren and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration administrator Jane Lubchenco -- are expected to be questioned about the e-mails.
\
Davies defended Jones and his colleagues, saying the publication of their e-mails ""is the latest example of a sustained and, in some instances, a vexatious campaign"" to undermine climate science. The sentiment was echoed by Stern.
\
""It has created confusion and confusion never helps scientific discussions,"" Stern told reporters in London Tuesday. ""The degree of skepticism among real scientists is very small.""
\
Governments are in the final days of preparations for Copenhagen conference, which is due to outline a new climate change agreement. Stern said the stakes were very high, explaining that if countries did not manage to reach agreement, world temperatures could rise by five degrees Celsius (nine degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, making much of the world uninhabitable.
\
""We have a moment now when we could get a strategy agreed,"" Stern said. ""If it were to dissolve in disarray it would not be easy to put this momentum back together again.""
\
A group of scientists who run the RealClimate Web site -- including Gavin Schmidt at the NASA space agency and Michael Mann at Pennsylvania State University -- have now begun posting links to their data sources online in the stated interest of making the science ""as open and transparent as possible.""
\
Australia emission plan rejected
\
SYDNEY (AP) -- Australia's Parliament defeated legislation to set up a greenhouse gas emissions trading system today, throwing into disarray a central plank of the government's plans to combat global warming.
\
The Senate, where Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's government does not hold a majority, rejected his administration's proposal for Australia to become one of the first countries to install a so-called cap-and-trade system to slash the amount of heat-trapping pollution that industries pump into the air.

88,"In a new Gallup Poll asking who is the national leader of the Republican Party, Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels didn't even rate an asterisk. That's unsurprising. The governor of the country's 16th most populous state won't normally garner much national attention, especially when he's an unassuming, old-school budget cutter.\It's also a shame, because more than any other Republican officeholder, Daniels points the way ahead for his bedraggled party. He's a Reaganite who's not trapped in 1980s nostalgia; he's a fiscal conservative who believes not just in limiting government, but in reforming it to address people's everyday concerns; he's a politician of principle who refuses to sell his program in off-puttingly partisan or ideological terms.\As they grapple with President Barack Obama, Republicans at the national level could do worse than ask themselves: What would Daniels do?\At a recent forum in Washington sponsored by the Bradley Foundation and Hudson Institute, Daniels noted that Ralph Waldo Emerson said every polity tends to have a party of memory and a party of hope. ""Hope"" has of late become a kind of swear word for conservatives, so Daniels could have been expected to be winding up for a jab at Obama. Instead, he said, ""We must be, as we have been in our better days, our more successful days, a party of hope.""\Daniels went on to give a plug for empathy as an animating attitude for the GOP: ""We must not only assert, but assert with credibility, that we understand what is going on in the lives of everyday people.""\His pitch included a plug for Republicans directing themselves ""almost entirely to the young people of this country."" In Indiana, Daniels explained, the GOP is ""the party of purpose,"" arrayed against Democrats who are ""reactionary"" and ""negative"" -- ""everything we must not be, as we address national events.""\If this sounds like a call for a mushy me-tooism, it isn't. When Daniels took office, the state had an $800 million deficit. He turned it into a $1.3 billion surplus (although it will be eaten into in the current downturn). Since 2005, he's saved roughly $450 million in the state's budget and reduced the state's rate of spending growth from 5.9 percent to 2.8 percent.\""I tell you with certainty,"" Daniels told his Washington audience, ""concern about the debt and deficit has not gone out of style.""\""Mitch the Knife,"" as he was nicknamed when he headed George W. Bush's Office of Management and Budget, has matched his fiscal probity with the restless innovation of a devoted policy entrepreneur. He leased the state's faltering toll road to a European operator for nearly $4 billion. He created health savings accounts for Indiana's poor. He deregulated telecommunications. And he attracted business to the state, with Indiana winning more foreign investment than any other state during the past two years.\A populist outcry against the toll-road deal dragged Daniels' approval rating down to 37 percent at one point, and his tenure seemed a warning against putting a tightfisted technocrat in elected office. But opinion turned. He won re-election by 18 points last year.\He won 20 percent of the black vote, and beat his Democratic opponent among voters under age 30 by 7 points.\Daniels counsels national Republicans to adopt a ""no, but"" approach. As he told an interviewer from National Journal, on cap-and-trade he'd say: ""No, let's not double the tax on poor people in the vain hope of moving the world's thermometer. Here's a way to conserve energy and protect the environment that doesn't impoverish the nation."" On health care, he'd say, ""Sure, let's get people covered with health insurance, but here's a much better way.""\His success has stoked speculation about a possible 2012 presidential run. Daniels has made Shermanesque disavowals of national ambitions, and expressed confidence that new national leaders will soon emerge. When they do, they should heed the lesson and message of Mitch Daniels.\Credit: By Rich Lowry"
89,"
WASHINGTON -- Al Gore made an emotional return to Congress Wednesday to plead with lawmakers to fight global warming with moral courage while revealing nothing about whether he'll join the 2008 presidential race.
\
The former vice president is a Democratic favorite for the presidential nomination even though he says he's not running. Fresh off a triumphant Hollywood appearance in which his climate-change documentary, ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" won two Oscars, Gore drew overflow crowds as he testified before House and Senate panels about a ""true planetary emergency.""
\
He said the issue should not be partisan or political, but Gore faced skeptical Republicans who questioned his personal commitment to reducing energy usage and the science behind his film.
\
""You're not just off a little, you're totally wrong,"" said Texas Rep. Joe Barton, the leading Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, as he challenged Gore's conclusion that carbon dioxide emissions cause rising global temperatures. Barton and Gore's exchange grew testy at one point -- Barton demanding that Gore get to the point and Gore responding that he would like time to answer without being interrupted.
\
""Global warming science is uneven and evolving,"" Barton said.
\
Gore insisted that the link is beyond dispute and is the source of broad agreement in the scientific community.
\
""The planet has a fever,"" Gore said. ""If your baby has a fever, you go to the doctor. If the doctor says you need to intervene here, you don't say, 'Well, I read a science fiction novel that told me it's not a problem.' If the crib's on fire, you don't speculate that the baby is flame retardant. You take action.""
\
Gore's congressional testimony marked the first time he had been to Capitol Hill since January 2001, when he was the defeated Democratic presidential nominee still presiding over the Senate in his role as vice president. It comes 20 years after Gore, then a congressman from Tennessee, held the first hearings in Congress on global warming.
\
It also brought him face-to-face with Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who could have her front-runner status threatened if Gore decided to challenge her for the party nomination. But there was no political fireworks between them at the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing.
\
Clinton said she found some of Gore's ideas ""extremely intriguing"" and asked for more details on proposals such as a carbon- based tax, a cap-and-trade system and a carbon neutral mortgage association.
\
In a day of testimony, Gore first appeared before a joint hearing by two House committees, with his wife, Tipper, sitting behind him and a stack of boxes beside him containing hundreds of thousands of messages asking Congress to act on global warming. Later, he testified before the Senate panel where partisan bickering grew even louder.
\
Republican Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, who has labeled global warming a hoax, complained that the Democratic leadership gave Gore extra time and advantages not afforded typical witnesses. Inhofe then grilled Gore about his personal energy use at his Tennessee mansion and showed the final frame of Gore's film that read, ""Are you ready to change the way you live?""
\
When Gore tried to respond at length, Inhofe cut him off.
\
Democratic Chairwoman Barbara Boxer kept trying to bring order to the hearing. She told Inhofe he can't control things anymore now that Republicans have lost their majority. ""Elections have consequences, so I make the rules,"" she said, holding up her gavel to cheers from the audience.
\
Gore sighed heavily and proposed that he and Inhofe have breakfast and privately discuss it away from the cameras.
\
Gore said he hopes whoever is elected president in 2008 ""can use his or her political chips"" to lead the world toward a new global climate treaty to replace the 1997 Kyoto protocol that requires 35 industrial nations to cut greenhouse gases. The Bush administration argues Kyoto would hurt the U.S. economy and objects that high- polluting developing nations like China and India are not required to reduce emissions.
\
""I fully understand that Kyoto, as a brand if you will, has been demonized,"" Gore said.
\
Gore was warmly welcomed back by some of his critics, such as Rep. Ralph Hall, R-Texas, who remembered serving with Gore's father and bantered with Gore about an evening boat ride they took together. ""You're dear to us, but I just don't agree with you on this,"" Hall said.
\
Gore advised lawmakers to cut carbon dioxide and other warming gases 90 percent by 2050 to avoid a crisis. Doing that, he said, will require a ban on any new coal-burning power plants -- a major source of industrial carbon dioxide -- that lack state-of-the-art controls to capture the gases.
\
He said he foresees a revolution in small-scale electricity producers for replacing coal, likening the development to what the Internet has done for the exchange of information.
\
""There is a sense of hope in this country that this United States Congress will rise to the occasion and present meaningful solutions to this crisis,"" Gore said. ""Our world faces a true planetary emergency. I know the phrase sounds shrill, and I know it's a challenge to the moral imagination.""
"
90,"Gov. Gary Herbert says the scientific jury is still out on climate change and he has promised an honest-to-goodness debate on one of the major policies of our time.\While the new administration is beginning to move on the pledge first made in August, the shape and nature of the forum has yet to crystallize.\Scientists at the state's leading universities -- Utah, Brigham Young and Utah State -- have offered to help the governor untangle the technicalities of climate change. So have members of the Blue-Ribbon Advisory Committee on climate change, a multifaceted group that studied the issue for a year and advised former Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. on the subject.\But no one has yet received invitations for Herbert's forum because the organizers haven't decided who should participate.\""It's very much in the formative stage,"" said Kirk Jowers, director of the University of Utah's Hinckley Institute of Politics and one of the organizers of the event.\And, while it is unclear who will play a big role in the meeting -- tentatively slated for April, around Earth Day -- what will be up for discussion is certain.\""Science will be the place to start,"" said Jowers. ""All sides will be presented fairly. That is absolutely the single most important thing.""\Ted Wilson, Herbert's new environment czar, echoes the idea that balance is essential. As the forum's lead organizer, he has been fielding ideas about recommended speakers from science, economics and other disciplines. The panels will include ""rainmaker-type featured speakers,"" who will not debate, and scientists, who will.\It's unclear whether the governor's forum will be a replay of the Legislature's Public Utilities Committee climate change hearing last month.\The panel invited scientific experts for their input. But it created what some criticized as a false balance by giving equal weight to University of Utah Atmospheric Science Department Chairman Jim Steenburgh, who represented the consensus view of climate scientists, and Roy Spencer. Spencer is an atmospheric scientist from the University of Alabama who has been one of the most vocal skeptics of the prevailing view that humans are largely responsible for global warming.\Wilson said Herbert is interested in getting to the truth in order to form responsible policies.\""This is a governor who wants his departments to do all they can to prepare for the future,"" said Wilson, a former Salt Lake City mayor and past director of the Hinckley Institute.\The discussion is expected to be still another step in the evolution of the Republican governor's handling of a climate change policy to help Utah deal with what scientists expect to be hotter temperatures statewide and deeper droughts in southern parts of the state.\Last summer, Herbert told the Western Governors Association he is not convinced climate science is conclusive and questioned the state's continued involvement in the Western Climate Initiative, a regional organization focused on responding to global warming.\In a September report released with U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch, Herbert said Utah's economy and people would be devastated by cap-and-trade legislation aimed at coping with climate change. In October, he restated his view that ""the debate is raging"" about the human impact on climate change.\""Maybe the scientists, maybe they feel good,"" he told reporters during a televised news conference. ""But they are not getting the word to the public because the public is very confused on the issue.""\Jon A. Krosnick has been studying the disconnect between climate science and personal actions for more than a decade as a professor of communication and political science at Stanford University.\Citing opinion surveys, he said the public overwhelmingly believes that the Earth's climate is changing, the impact to society will be bad and that government should take action. But they are ""not buying"" that a disaster is on the horizon, as some scientists suggest.\One reason: The mass-media practice of representing the science as two-sided creates confusion. Another: Scientists do a lousy job of offering plausible solutions for dealing with climate change.\He said a forum based on simply presenting opposing views without providing context is unlikely to clear up the confusion.\""It will increase uncertainty,"" Krosnick said, unless organizers also ""tell people the prevalence of those views and the preponderance of evidence supporting them.""\More than 70 of the world's scientific associations have published statements affirming that climate is changing most likely because of human activities and that it is a growing threat to human societies.\Kelly Patterson, a BYU political scientist, said he doubts a single forum like Herbert's will do much to affect public opinion. On complex issues like climate change, people form their views based on what they see, hear and read in the media, as well as what they learn from associates, he said.\""Rare is the individual who sits down and weighs the evidence,"" he said. ""In these kinds of situations, people tend to side with trusted sources.""\fahys@sltrib.com\The governor's promise of a debate on climate change\Gov. Gary Herbert announced in August that he plans to convene experts on both sides of the climate change issue to debate the science and help shape the best policy for the state.\Herbert said his goal is to, ""for the first time, have a legitimate debate with civility, have discussion on climate change, man's impact on the climate and global warming: what it is, where it is and what you do about it, including cost-to-benefit analysis and making sure we have good science that dictates and leads us toward good policy.""\The governor said it has not taken a position ""on man-caused global warming or the impact it has.""\Credit: By Judy Fahys The Salt Lake Tribune"
91,"California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. delivered a sharp rebuke to Washington on Monday for doing too little to tackle climate change.\They said federal inaction drove governors to create the ""Western Regional Climate Action Initiative,"" a pact involving six states and the Canadian province of British Columbia that is aimed at cutting the pollution blamed for speeding up global warming. Schwarzenegger came to Salt Lake City on Monday to jointly announce, with Huntsman, that Utah is joining the partnership.\With Utah making the commitment, ""I know that other states can't be far behind,"" said the California governor, a Republican whose state is credited with having the nation's most progressive policies to reduce climate change.\""It sends a very clear message to the federal government: We are forming this partnership because of the lack of leadership from the federal government.""\Neither the Republican Bush administration nor the Democrat-controlled Congress escaped criticism at the Governor's Mansion news conference where the two signed the pact. The two GOP governors noted their partnership includes four Democrats, including New Mexico Gov. and Democratic presidential candidate Bill Richardson.\""This isn't about party politics,"" said Huntsman. ""It's about doing the right thing for all of our citizens.""\The partnership includes setting up a standardized system of measuring greenhouse gasses this year, setting regionwide and state-by-state goals for emissions-reduction benchmarks and establishing a ""cap and trade"" marketplace for trading those emissions sometime next year. In addition, participating states will improve energy efficiency and promote greater use of renewable energy.\Huntsman first became intrigued by the initiative when it was announced at a national governors' meeting last February. Since then, scientists have released a series of new international reports that assert climate global warming is being speeded by human activities, that people need to prepare for it and that reasonable solutions can soften the likely effects.\A couple of weeks ago, Huntsman signed up Utah as one of 31 states that are tools to measure the ""greenhouse gasses"" behind climate change. Many businesses and policymakers predict such a system will be needed soon, when greenhouse gasses come under government or market-based controls. \Huntsman already has set a goal of improving energy efficiency in Utah homes, businesses and government buildings by 25 percent in the next eight years. He said in coming weeks he will adopt a policy that Utah will use a certain amount of renewable energy by a certain date.\Both governors said the West has a lot to lose by failing to reduce the rate of global warming, which is expected to bring more drought, fire and shorter winters to the region.\""Higher temperatures are an economic threat to all of us,"" said Schwarzenegger, the former movie action hero.\In California, he said, the strategy of dealing with climate change, and marshalling technology to help do it, has been successful. ""We have proven we can do both.""\Both Huntsman and Schwarzenegger talked about the importance of technology for dealing with climate change. Doing so is critical for a state like Utah, where coal has been the mainstay of the energy supply and a key component of the regional energy market.\""It's not like saying, 'Stop producing coal,' "" said Schwarzenegger. ""But let's find ways to produce clean coal. It's not saying, 'Stop flying big airplanes.' No, but let's create different engines with hydrogen or biofuel. Technology is the answer. Not to stop those things and try to roll the clock back to the Stone Ages.""\Sarah Wright of Utah Clean Energy, an advocacy group, agreed the partnership can benefit both the environment and the economy.\""It's a huge step for Utah and the West because it shows our leadership,"" she said.\Josh Dorner, a spokesman for the national office of the Sierra Club, praised the governor's leadership and underscored the failure of Congress and the White House to deal with climate change.\""In the states,"" everyone is eager to tackle these issues,"" he said. ""But back here in Washington, it's business as usual.""\The Sierra Club on Monday urged the Bush administration to grant California a waiver it has sought to toughen emission standards for vehicles. Schwarzenegger mentioned that request during his Utah appearance, saying Washington should stop impeding states that try to take the initiative.\Kristin Hellmer, a spokeswoman for the White House Council on Environmental Quality, challenged the governors' assertion that the Bush administration is not doing enough.\""That is just not the case,"" she said. ""We've just chosen a different path.""\She said the Bush administration has spent $37 billion since 2001 on climate-change science and programs, and it has requested another $7.5 billion for 2008. White House initiatives include mandatory, voluntary and incentive-based programs, she said.\Dorner disputed that view: ""It's pretty apparent to anyone who looks in-depth that the administration is doing nothing on climate change.""\fahys@sltrib.com\Online source\To learn more, visit www.azclimatechange.gov/download/022607wrca.pdf.\Credit: By Judy Fahys The Salt Lake Tribune"
92,"If you’ve followed Utah’s Republican primary, you can’t help but notice the degree to which the governor’s race has been defined by allegiance to President Donald Trump.\It is a litmus test for the candidates.\Former House Speaker Greg Hughes has wrapped himself in the Trump brand. Heck, he’s probably lived off nothing but Trump steaks for the past eight months.\As my colleague Taylor Stevens highlighted over the weekend, Hughes has created a page on his website highlighting Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox’s criticisms of candidate Trump, which Cox has tried to explain away.\“As a farmer from rural Utah, I was skeptical that a former Democrat from New York would care about Utah and our way of life,” Cox said in a recent debate, adding that he has come around on the president. “No state in America has a better working relationship with President Trump than Utah. As governor, I will ensure that we continue to work together to deliver for our state.”\Thomas Wright touts how he was an early supporter of Trump. And Gov. Jon Huntsman, who served as Trump’s ambassador to Russia, has sent out mailers with a photo of him with the president.\It makes sense. A recent Tribune poll found 82% of Republicans approve of the president’s performance, 54% of them strongly approve.\But other poll numbers out last week raise a question that hasn’t come up in the campaign. A slew of polls in key presidential battleground states paint a bleak picture for Trump.\Democrat Joe Biden is trouncing the president in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Minnesota. Biden leads in Florida, North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona. Fox News even had Biden up a point in Texas, which hasn’t supported a Democrat since Jimmy Carter.\After 2016, we are a bit skeptical of polls, but with a trend so overwhelming, it’s certainly possible the loyalty to Trump shown by the winner of Tuesday’s primary will be less important than how they deal with President Biden.\The candidates say the right things.\“It’s the job of the governor to forge a relationship and have a good working relationship with whoever is the president of the United States,” Wright said. “While I support the Republican candidate, if the Democrat candidate were to win, I’d do everything I could to have a functioning, working and respectful relationship.”\Huntsman focuses on his work as ambassador for both Trump and President Barack Obama and says that he is “confident I will be able to work with the White House regardless of the outcome of the November election.”\It might be more helpful to look at what the candidates say they’ll do — based on the thorough issues survey compiled by my Tribune colleagues — and their track records to see where friction may arise. I’ve chosen three areas worth considering: health care, climate change and public lands.\Obamacare\Biden helped Obama push the Affordable Care Act through Congress, calls it a “victory,” and says he would build on it during his presidency.\That’s bad news to Hughes, who as speaker blocked Medicaid expansion in Utah, helping to defeat Gov. Gary Herbert’s Healthy Utah plan, which Cox tried to get through the Legislature. While Cox says he questions the constitutionality of Obamacare, he has shown a willingness to work within its parameters.\As governor, Huntsman said he was open to the idea of individual mandates, but later backed away from them. In 2013, on “Meet The Press,” he said Republicans should fix problems with Obamacare, but can’t take an “all-or-nothing” approach. Wright has less of a record on the issue, but has been critical of Obamacare generally.\Climate change\Candidate Biden says there is “no greater challenge facing our country and world than climate change,” and would issue executive orders setting pollution limits and putting the U.S. on track to have 100% renewable energy by 2050.\Three of the candidates — Wright, Huntsman and Cox — acknowledge that humans contribute to climate change, while Hughes argues that saying humans cause climate change “would suggest that absent any humans, the climate wouldn’t change.” (It doesn’t suggest that.)\At an Envision Utah forum Hughes said climate concerns are overblown and touted Utah’s “clean coal,” so you can imagine federal action on climate would not sit well with a Hughes administration.\Wright, at the Envision event, couched climate change as a threat to Utah’s ski industry and outdoor recreation. “We need to do everything we can to be responsible stewards of our environment,” he said. “We need to balance that with being smart and not going overboard and hurting our economies.”\In 2018, Cox said there was “clear evidence” that climate change played a role in Utah’s wildfires, but said it is a global problem and the state’s ability to impact the climate is limited. And he has said the solution can’t come at the expense of Utah’s economy.\Huntsman wrote in 2014 that Republicans could not afford to ignore the climate. As governor, he set the state’s first renewable energy target and championed a Western states cap-and-trade plan which, by his presidential bid in 2011, he said had failed.\Public lands\It’s a good bet that in a Biden administration Utah will see the restoration of the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante monuments that Trump shrunk and a general shift away from a focus on natural resource extraction on public lands. And it likely won’t sit well with Utah Republicans.\Three of the candidates have a clear focus on public lands. Cox is a former county commissioner who speaks of rural Utah’s struggles and criticized the Bears Ears designation by federal officials who live “in their ivory towers on the East Coast and [are] content to destroy our way of life.”\Both Cox and Hughes support a state lawsuit to take control of federal lands. “I’ve had it,” Hughes has said on the issue. “I’ve had enough of their mismanagement, I’ve had enough of them blocking our ability to responsibly manage OUR lands.”\Wright’s running mate, outgoing U.S. Rep. Rob Bishop, has made state control of public lands a cornerstone of his time in Congress.\Huntsman, as governor, largely delegated public lands policy to his No. 2, then-Lt. Gov. Gary Herbert. As a candidate, Huntsman promises (in fairly vague fashion) to use a collaborative approach to develop “local-based solutions that balance the national interest in our public lands.”\By highlighting these three issues, I’m not suggesting one candidate is inherently better. Sure, there would be more conflict in a Hughes administration, and maybe Utahns want a governor who will stand up to a Democratic president.\But for those GOP primary voters who haven’t cast their ballots yet (you have until Tuesday to get them in the mail): It’s worth considering where the candidates stand in relation to Trump, but maybe give some consideration to how Utah’s next leader might operate if Biden is in the White House.\Editor’s note: Jon Huntsman is the brother of Paul Huntsman, the chairman of The Tribune’s nonprofit board of directors.\Crédito: By Robert Gehrke"

Who's the best person to lead a witch hunt? A witch, of course.
\
Keep that in mind when you hear progressive members of Congress claiming they are investigating whether research grants have influenced the views of several well-respected environmental scientists. Because in the public's mind the people most likely to sell their opinions to the highest bidder aren't scientists but ... politicians.
\
Progressive critics are trying to smear the character and reputations of some environmental scientists because they disagree with other environmental scientists - and activists.
\
While there are some differences, in general the witch-hunted scientists question whether the Earth is warming, or whether it will warm as much or as fast as some predict, and how much of a role humans and fossil fuels play in that change.
\
Ironically, the ones being targeted happen to be on the correct side of the data - at least for the time being.
\
Global temperatures have remained relatively flat for the past 17 years, prompting The New York Times to ask two years ago, ""What to make of a warming plateau?""
\
Climate-change debates can be very sophisticated, using complex scientific data that go way over the heads of most Americans - including the congressional smear-mongers who, incidentally, are not themselves environmental scientists.
\
For example, a leading critic is Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., who has an undergraduate degree in sociology.
\
Many of the environmental scientists on the pro-warming side also get research grants.
\
The Obama administration hands out more than $2 billion each year to scientists engaged in climate research. And you can bet that the ones most likely to receive those grants are those who agree with Obama on climate change. Do the critics believe those scientists are letting the money determine their views?
\
And let's not forget that members of Congress also take donations - lots of them from major environmental groups. Should we ask if these witch hunters are bought and paid for by their biggest campaign donors?
\
Here's another question: Why don't the media investigate who's behind the money that funds many of the environmental groups and liberal politicians?
\
Last summer, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the former prime minister of Denmark, alleged that Russia was secretly funding the anti-fracking movement.
\
""I have met with allies who can report that Russia, as part of their sophisticated information and disinformation operations, engaged actively with so-called nongovernment organizations - environmental organizations working against shale gas - to maintain European dependence on imported Russian gas,"" Rasmussen asserted.
\
Oil and gas revenue accounts for more than half of the Russian government's budget. Might Russia be secretly funneling money to pro-environmental organizations and politicians in an effort to slow down U.S. energy production so Russia can sell more of its energy at a higher price?
\
The fact is that congressional smear-mongering is really a form of political bullying.
\
Members of Congress can target an individual, company or industry to create false impressions and cast doubts with little or no evidence - and get a lot of media attention doing it.
\
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid recently conceded he lied when he accused Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney of not paying his taxes. Reid is also engaged in smearing the Koch brothers, who give money to conservative groups.
\
The fact is that virtually all nonprofit research organizations (mine included) and many scientists receive donations and grants - often from multiple sources, including nonprofit foundations - to support their research, not to influence their conclusions.
\
The public should be outraged, but not at well-respected scholars and organizations engaged in open and public debate about climate change.
\
It should be outraged at elected officials who try to boost their own careers - and donations - by attacking others who know much more about a topic than the smear-mongers ever will.

\
The capital's right-wing lobbying legions are far off-base charging that a handful of congressional progressives are conducting McCarthy-style vendettas against climate-change deniers. And they are super-hypocritical as well!
\
After all, these ultraconservative policy institutes, websites and pundits are funded out of the deep pockets of such environmental devastators as Koch Industries, British Petroleum, Freeport McMoran, Massey Energy, DuPont and North American Coal Corp.
\
The tens of millions of dollars committed to this ""debunking"" cause each year also support a number of scientists - including some at major universities - who shamefully attack the findings of such renowned climate scientists as James Hansen and Bill McKibben.
\
It was Hansen who added the gravitas of NASA research to prove that devastating climate change is a clear and present danger. And it was Hansen who reaped a whirlwind of vitriolic abuse from the pollution lobby for standing up to the climate-change deniers.
\
McKibben, the world's leading environmental writer and the Schumann Distinguished Scholar at Vermont's Middlebury College, also has been attacked unmercifully by the misguided supporters of fossil fuels.
\
One can argue, as Hansen and McKibben have, about whether cap-and-trade tax regimen is a proper method for dealing with climate change.
\
But what cannot be ignored are the overwhelming scientific facts that point to our planet passing a point of no return with regard to the effects of man-made global climate change. Consider just a few of many recent events facts:
\
* Australia has been dealing with an intense drought for a decade, and the lack of fresh water in Perth has resulted in that city being forced to desalinate sea water.
\
* An unprecedented drought in Sao Paulo, Brazil, a megacity of 20 million, and an epochal drought in California point to the unarguable drastic effects of climate change. Brazil is already considering how to deal with ""water refugees,"" and California, Arizona and Nevada may not be far behind.
\
Those who deny the planet is undergoing climate change from man-made pollutants claim that the climate scientists are Chicken Littles who are running around yelling ""The sky is falling!"" However, it's the climate-change deniers who are the veritable ostriches with their heads buried in the sand.
\
One of the chief ostriches is Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., the new chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
\
Inhofe's cheap publicity stunt of tossing a snowball inside the Senate chamber after a snowstorm in Washington was supposed to be proof that there is no global warming.
\
However, it's not ""global warming"" that's the issue but rather the weakening of weather-dependent currents like the Gulf Stream that is causing extreme fluxes from bitter cold to intense heat in the Atlantic Ocean and other maritime littoral regions.
\
Inhofe, the author of ""The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future,"" relied upon the typical pejorative term ""alarmists"" used by ""conspiracy theorists"" to taint bona fide climate-change scientists who have proved their case in thousands of peer-reviewed papers and studies.
\
Inhofe's snowballs and insults aside, the U.S. government did conclude that 2014 was the warmest year on record. That scientific fact, added to many other record-breaking metrics around the world, have some members of Congress, including Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) asking the right questions about what entities are paying for the ""junk science"" on climate change.
\
Grijalva is justifiably concerned for the welfare of the people in his district and state. With the Colorado River and Lake Mead running dry, Arizona cities such as Phoenix, Tucson and Tempe, in addition to Las Vegas and Los Angeles, face an uncertain water future.
\
The congressional representatives from those and other climate change-affected areas have every right to find out who is paying for the bogus science on a looming environmental catastrophe.

2 -- What specifically should be done about the 12 million or so illegal immigrants who are now in the United States?
\
""We need a pathway to deportation. To facilitate this pathway to deportation, we should allow people currently here illegally to come forward and apply for a short-term work visa if done in conjunction with a sponsoring legal business. The visa will be for a specified time. At the conclusion of the visa, the illegal immigrant must return to his or her country of origin, or face serious criminal consequences.
\
""This should be a limited-time offer and any adult person identified without this application in process should be detained and deported. This will allow us to identify illegal immigrants and uniformly return them to their country of origin while allowing a legal workforce, with proper documentation and background checks, to enter the country in a uniform fashion.""
\
3 -- Do you favor or oppose some kind of pathway to legal status for the current illegal immigrants?
\
""For those here illegally, the ONLY pathway to U.S. citizenship is to go home to their country of origin and apply from there. Period. However, fixing our legal immigration process is critical. Those who apply legally, the way we want them to, should be able to get a timely answer. The process of immigrating legally should not stretch out for decades as it does now.""
\
4 -- Utah has a state law that allows children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition to public colleges and universities. Do you favor or oppose that law? And do you believe Congress should pass a similar law?
\
""I oppose in-state tuition for those who are here illegally. The whole principle is wrong. We should not offer rewards and incentives for those who are here illegally. We must reward those who follow the rules, not those who have broken them.""
\
5 -- What specifically can you do to make sure Congress comes up with an illegal immigration solution over the next two years of your term?
\
""Each member of Congress has political capital to spend. I intend to spend my political capital on the immigration issue by joining the Immigration Reform Caucus and working with like-minded members of Congress to sponsor and co-sponsor immigration reform related bills.""
\
6 -- Does Congress have any role in providing affordable gasoline to Americans over the next two years? If so, what should Congress do?
\
""First, we must remove the restrictions that government has placed on energy development in this country. We have to be able to extract the resources found here in Utah, throughout the United States and off our shores. Secondly, reducing federal spending and debt will naturally help the falling dollar recover its value, which will directly impact the price we pay for all imported goods, including oil.""
\
7 -- It appears now that Republicans will not be in the majority in the U.S. House next year. What can you do to make yourself effective as a member of the minority party?
\
""I intend to stand true to the conservative principles of fiscal discipline, limited government, accountability, and strong national security. Republicans need to articulate our stand on the issues and the principles that drive those positions. We need to make a case to the American people that we have a better, smarter way to govern. Further, I plan to join like-minded representatives in the Reagan 21 group, the Immigration Reform Caucus, and others to fight business as usual in Washington, DC. I will reach across the aisle, but without sacrificing my principles.""
\
8 -- Much has been made recently of so-called ""spending earmarks"" where a congressman gets funding for specific projects in his district in a budget bill. Do you personally favor or oppose such ""earmarks"" in spending bills? Will you put ""earmarks"" into funding bills for the 3rd District?
\
""I unequivocally oppose the abusive use of earmarks. I will not ask for an earmark until this process is changed. I will seek funding through the normal appropriation process. I am appalled that members of Congress, especially Mr. Cannon, will not reveal what earmarks theyre requesting. My refusal to ask for earmarks is found at www.earmarkpledge.com.""
\
9 -- Congress has not adopted a balanced budget in years. Do you believe it is desirable, or even possible, to have a balanced federal budget? What would you do as a congressman to get a balanced budget?
\
""We must balance the budget and pay down the debt. Balancing the budget will take political will. I have that will and Ill fight that fight. We can not be all things to all people. We must cut spending at the federal level. This means proactively addressing entitlement programs, the 28% of our 1,100 federal programs that fail to demonstrate results (www.expectmore.gov), reforming earmarks, across the board budget cuts, and taking a business approach to the function of government.""
\
10 -- This past spring there were a number of critics complaining about how the Utah Republican Party selected delegates and oversaw intra-party challenges, including convention fights. Do you believe the party properly handled its internal nominating process? If not, what kind of improvements do you think the party should undertake to make the candidate nominating process better?
\
""I think the Republican Party has a big job and they do it well. I do have concerns about automatic delegates that I would like to have addressed. I appreciate that party leaders are now looking at providing a mechanism for delegates to make their e-mail addresses available to campaigns. Overall, I appreciate the delegate process and find it the best way to select a candidate to represent the party.""
\
11 -- How should the Iraqi War be brought to a conclusion?
\
""Our troops have restored order to the country, but we desperately need a political solution so we can bring our troops home sooner rather than later. We are moving in the right direction but the diplomatic efforts need better results.""
\
12 -- How long do you think American troops should be in Iraq?
\
""I dont believe you can set an arbitrary timeline, but I dont want to see our troops in Iraq for decades, as some have advocated. The goal should be complete withdrawal over a reasonable time period, sooner rather than later.""
\
13 Can you now promise not to vote to raise taxes over the next two years?
\
""I have signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge and can absolutely promise I will not vote to raise taxes during my term. Government does not have a revenue problem, it has a spending problem.""
\
14 -- What role do you think religion should play in America's political and governmental life?
\
""The proper role of government is to protect our religious liberties. We the people must be able to practice our religious freedoms. We are a nation of faith, inspired by God, and we must never forget the role religion has played in the foundation and formation of our country. We are one nation under God, and we should not forget this nor should we shy away from it.""
\
15 -- Utah's two U.S. senators are split over whether the federal constitution should be changed to protect the flag. Do you favor or oppose such an amendment?
\
""I am in favor of a constitutional amendment to protect the flag of the United States of America.""
\
16 -- Do you favor or oppose a U.S. constitutional amendment recognizing only traditional marriage, between one man and one woman?
\
""I favor a constitutional amendment as I believe marriage should be exclusively the union of one man and one woman. The American family is the cornerstone of this great country, and I will work tirelessly to protect its sanctity.""
\
17 -- Do you favor or oppose new nuclear power plants in the United States? In Utah?
\
""I support the development of additional nuclear power facilities in this country and in Utah. Nuclear energy has many advantages. It's clean, it's proven, and we can own the technology. We haven't built a nuclear power plant in this country in decades. That must change. We're going to have to accelerate legal authorization and environmental impact studies to pave the way for additional nuclear development. I oppose the importation of nuclear waste from other countries, and I oppose the utilization of Yucca Mountain.""
\
18 -- In your opinion, is global warming a fact? If not, what do you think is happening, if anything, to the Earth's climate?
\
""I believe global warming is a farce. Certainly the earth experiences patterns of climate change, as it has throughout time. I reject the notion that mankind is able to control those patterns or that we are solely to blame. Surely pollutants from around the world effect our environment, and we should be conservative in our approach. We have a stewardship of this planet and we must pursue cleaner energy and alternative fuels. I reject cap and trade policies that buy and sell credits for carbon emissions.""
\
19 -- Why would you make a better congressman than your Republican opponent?
\
""I intend to spend my political capital on the issues that matter most to Utah. I am passionate, tenacious, and driven by principle. Mr. Cannon has squandered his opportunities on issues Utahns dont care about and he hasnt been able to address the ones we do care about. I will fight to cut spending, develop a national energy policy, fix illegal immigration, and get the federal government out of local education. These are the issues Utahns want their Congressman to address.""
\
20 -- What is your greatest strength in being a congressman, what is your GOP opponent's greatest weakness?
\
""My greatest strength and my opponents greatest weakness are the same the ability to communicate. I will passionately articulate Utahs position to Washington. I will always make listening to constituents a priority for myself and my staff. Communication is a two-way street. Utahns deserve someone who can listen to them and then effectively articulate our perspective and values in Washington.""

\
""I unequivocally oppose the abusive use of earmarks. I will not ask for an earmark until this process is changed. I will seek funding through the normal appropriation process.

2 -- What specifically should be done about the 12 million or so illegal immigrants who are now in the United States?
\
""We need a pathway to deportation. To facilitate this pathway to deportation, we should allow people currently here illegally to come forward and apply for a short-term work visa if done in conjunction with a sponsoring legal business. The visa will be for a specified time. At the conclusion of the visa, the illegal immigrant must return to his or her country of origin, or face serious criminal consequences.
\
""This should be a limited-time offer and any adult person identified without this application in process should be detained and deported. This will allow us to identify illegal immigrants and uniformly return them to their country of origin while allowing a legal workforce, with proper documentation and background checks, to enter the country in a uniform fashion.""

"
97," WASHINGTON - The global warming train finally is leaving the station with almost everyone onboard - except for a few die-hard deniers from ultra-conservative groups and the Flat Earth Society.\ Now comes the really difficult task - one that demands a thorough debate among all governments and all peoples: What can we humans do to prevent global warming and ameliorate its more negative impacts?\ The decisions we reach are vital; they almost surely will determine if our small, fragile planet survives and whether we Americans continue to enjoy all of the freedoms we hold so dear.\ There can be no doubt that Earth has entered a warming period - temperatures have risen about 1 degree Fahrenheit over the past 120 years - and there is good evidence that human generated greenhouse gas emissions have played a significant role since 1940.\ The most recent report by the United Nations' respected Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that - barring draconian remedial actions - global temperatures could increase as much as 11 degrees by 2100.\ If that is the case, the current mandates of the Kyoto treaty on climate change just won't cut it. Fully implemented by its signatory nations, Kyoto would trim only one degree of warmth from the U.N.'s worst-case projection by 2100 - a decrease that matches the recorded increase in temperature since the latter-part of the 19th century.\ Unfortunately, Kyoto exempts such major emerging economies as China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico, which together are projected to account for more than 60 percent of the world's man- made greenhouse gases by the year 2040.\ Even worse, most European Union nations actually have increased their emissions of carbon dioxide since the alliance imposed a system of emission trading credits that allows low-level polluters to sell their surplus carbon credits to highest.\ The idea underlining such a convoluted system is that low-level polluters will reduce emissions even further so they have more carbon credits to sell; and higher-level polluters will make reductions to avoid having to pay for credits.\ The failures of Kyoto's mandates and the EU's system of emission trading credits have caused consternation and confusion on Capitol Hill.\ Even Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., the new chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Environment & Public Works, who favored such remedies when the Democrats were out of power, now has backed-off and is pursuing relatively small steps like increasing the energy efficiency of federal buildings.\ With the latest U.N. report declaring that global warming is all but unstoppable, such incremental measures seem ludicrous. Far bolder efforts than Kyoto and carbon trading credits will be required to blunt the impact of global warming, if the United Nations' forecasters are correct.\ The fastest, surest way, of course, would be for the United Nations itself to impose a tax on all of its member nations that correlates with the carbon footprint of each.\ Populous, heavily industrialized countries like the United States, India, China, Brazil, Japan, Mexico and the larger European states would pay through the smokestack, so to speak, while the poorer nations of Africa, Asia and Latin America would pay what amounts to chump change.\ The U.N. climate change panel calls for a 4 percent global tax on advanced countries in it recent report.\ That is a small price to pay for saving our planet - especially for a super-affluent society such as ours. For most Americans, it amounts to sacrificing a few automobile trips, a month's worth of Starbucks and maybe a dozen Big Macs. Given our national obesity epidemic, how can that hurt?\ The important thing about such a global carbon tax is that it would be eminently fair - taxing each nation according to its greenhouse gas emissions.\ Admittedly, getting a U.N. consensus to take even a trivial action is rough sledding. But every opinion leader committed to a sustainable, survivable planet - from Al Gore to Tony Blair to New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman - ought to add their voices to a chorus calling for this global tax.\ Such a tax would be economically benign - adding up to only a small fraction of each nation's Gross Domestic Product. That amount would be offset many-fold by the increased profits rolling in from the development of new ""green"" technology, not to mention the lower health-care costs generated by a cleaner environment.\ The only alternative would be to sit tight, do nothing and hope that the United Nations' predictions turn out to be bogus. Anyone want to buy some nice beachfront property in West Virginia?\ ---\ Wayne Madsen is a contributing writer for the liberal Online Journal (http://www.onlinejournal.com).

98,"Sen. Orrin Hatch and Sen. Mike Lee voted to confirm Scott Pruitt, an enemy of the Environment Protection Agency, to become its leader. It was no surprise. We know Republicans do not prioritize protection of the environment and are not worried about the effects of climate change on our planet.\However, some prominent conservatives and Republican elder statesmen, led by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, with former Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Henry M. Paulson Jr., a former secretary of the Treasury, recognize the threat of climate change. They have publicly come out in favor of a carbon tax proposal that would encourage a gradual phasing out of primary dependence on fossil fuels.\I would greatly encourage our two senators to support this proposal. Their influence on other senators could be crucial and they would gain the admiration of many of their constituents for standing up with courage and integrity for what is right for all of us.Franccoise Hibbs\"
99,"
In his Dec. 11 op-ed (""Common sense and the environment won [mostly] on Election Day,"") the Heartland Institute's H. Sterling Burnett opined, ""What surprised many people, however, was the fact many national environmental groups also opposed the carbon tax initiative.""
\
It might be equally surprising to Mr. Burnett just how many prominent conservatives support a common-sense revenue-neutral carbon tax structured the right way.
\
For example, former Secretary of State George Shultz co-authored a Wall Street Journal op-ed in 2013, ""Why We Support a Revenue-Neutral Carbon Tax."" Secretary Schultz is an advisory board member of the nonpartisan Citizens' Climate Lobby, which advocates carbon fee and dividend legislation, a market-based approach more effective than government regulations.
\
In an October 2016 speech, Exxon-Mobil CEO and incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said, ""We have long supported a carbon tax as the best policy of those being considered ... a revenue-neutral carbon tax would ensure a uniform and predictable cost of carbon across the economy."" This ""win-win"" solution is also supported by conservative think tanks R Street, Niskanen and RepublicEn.
\
The Heartland Institute and Mr. Burnett wouldn't want to be left out of a ""win-win"" solution that could bridge the partisan divide, would they?

100,"\I agree with much of what was said in the Dec. 18, 2018, Deseret News guest opinion titled “Cut carbon through innovation, not regulation,” except I think a fee on carbon is a good idea.\The cost of energy should reflect the cost of producing it, and that cost should include the adverse cost to the environment. If the fees collected were returned to the American people in the form of a monthly dividend, the average person would get back as much as they are paying in extra energy cost. A border adjustment fee could be applied to goods imported from countries that don’t have a carbon fee, to ensure fair trade.\A fee on carbon would encourage innovative carbon free ways of producing energy.\Russell Patterson\West Valley City\CREDIT: Russell Patterson, Deseret News"
101,"
It is time to go beyond the debate over human causation of global climate change and move toward a call to action. Can most of us at least agree, as do some of the major oil companies, that the current extraordinary levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are a threat to our collective long-term security? What if the actions we take as a society to reduce our carbon footprint have no real downside and actually could result in significant economic and environmental advantages? Do we truly care about our future generations enough to consider what their environment might look like if we fail to act?
\
The idea of putting a cost on carbon at its point of origin has been proposed by both conservative and liberal economists as a reasonable step to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide being added daily into the atmosphere. Taken together with the return of those fees in the form of a monthly dividend and you have a market-based solution to future energy needs. This solution is attractive for the following reasons:
\
First, it signals the markets that the cost of emitting carbon will rise over time. This signal would encourage the market to seek more clean and efficient energy solutions without any bias as to which emerging technology might be the best. Second, Regional Economic Modeling Inc. has issued a detailed report that shows a carbon fee and dividend will actually stimulate the economy as the new technologies will require both capital and labor investments in excess of the current investments. Lastly, the implementation of a carbon dividend opens the door to other initiatives that could further reduce our carbon footprint.
\
As we contemplate the ideas listed above, perhaps it is in our human nature to feel discouraged or overwhelmed. Maybe we simply feel that our political representatives are not in touch. However, is it not in our human spirit to never accept the status quo? British Columbia already has passed a province-wide carbon fee and dividend plan that has achieved a 20 percent reduction in carbon based fuels, as well as a reduction in local income tax.
\
If British Columbia has taken a step, then why not Utah? Gov. Gary Herbert has stated that Utah is being recognized as a global business leader. Utah is blessed with great universities, a culture of entrepreneurship, as well as untapped non-carbon energy resources. The benefits of proactively moving towards non-carbon energy resources certainly outweigh the costs of burning every bit of Utah coal and oil.
\
Implementing a carbon fee and dividend system in Utah could be the model for future national legislation. Let's think of those dividends returned to households as both an economic stimulus in the present and as an investment in the future. Your political representatives would like to hear your voice on this issue. This is the voice of putting a cost on carbon with the collected revenue being returned to you as monthly dividends. This is the voice of an economy driven by sustainable energy. This is the voice that values the future of our children.
\
The time to act is now, while fossil fuels have plummeted to some of the lowest levels in recent history. The EPA is threatening to take action of its own, which will push energy costs higher without the benefit of dividends. The carbon fee and dividend plan makes environmental, economic and political sense. The future security of our children and our grandchildren are hanging in the balance.

102,"Hillary Rodham Clinton has a new plan to ramp up emissions-free renewable energy. That puts her head-and-shoulders above her GOP rivals, who range from climate chickens to climate deniers. Nevertheless, her plan is plainly worse than what she ran on eight years ago ccc and it has a glaring gap.\Clinton's proposal came under immediate scrutiny in part because she hasn't taken a strong stand on the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline since leaving the State Department. But, like the rest of the debate on the pipeline, this reaction misses the point. The fate of the planet does not depend on a single oil infrastructure project but on the high-level policy that will shape the market for clean energy. On this, Clinton has some ideas; the problem is that they are all second-best ideas.\Clinton's strategy begins with a pledge to defend President Barack Obama's greenhouse-gas regulations, the final version of which will emerge soon from the Environmental Protection Agency. Those underpin Obama's promise to world leaders that the United States will reduce its greenhouse emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent by 2025 and increase renewables to 20 percent of the power grid by 2030. Clinton would enhance that commitment, promising that a full third of U.S. electricity would come from renewables by 2027, with an emphasis on installing new solar panels.\To get there, Clinton would put up federal cash to spur competition among states to reduce emissions. She would invest in more energy research and development. Yet it's curious that Clinton didn't offer a specific commitment to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, as she did in her previous White House run, preferring instead to articulate a renewables goal. Emissions are what drive climate change; renewables are just one tool to reduce them.\The best translation of that principle into policy is simple: Get rid of the country's complex web of energy subsidies and replace it with a price on carbon dioxide emissions. This wouldn't tilt the playing field, as some erroneously allege. It would flatten it, forcing emitters to pay for the dangerous damage they do to the environment.\The drawbacks are all political. The term ""carbon tax"" doesn't play well. ""Cap and trade"" has been smeared. Yet Clinton favored a cap-and-trade plan in 2007, and the case for carbon pricing has grown only stronger since then.\Clinton grandee John Podesta assures that ""these proposals are only the first steps in an ambitious climate and energy strategy."" We hope so."
103,"In 2011, an attempt was made in the Utah Senate to increase the gasoline tax, but it was voted down. BallotPedia reports that in 2018, state tax on gasoline is 29.41 cents and federal tax is 18.4 cents, for a total tax of 47.81 cents per gallon. Since this tax started in 1923, it has grown at the rate of 3 percent per year. The Utah Legislature passed a law in 2015 that will automatically increase the tax yearly if average fuel price has risen (not to exceed 40 cents, based on “certain factors”).\The gasoline tax issue has been resurrected again in Utah. Our Schools Now, which had been pushing for a ballot measure for school funding in the November elections, agreed to a compromise with the Legislature. The legislative resolution passed in 2018 puts the proposition of a 10 cents per gallon increase in the state gasoline taxes to finance roads and, indirectly, education on the November ballot. If passed, it is only advisory.\The proposed increase in tax revenue will not be enough to meet the original aspirations of Our Schools Now to fund education. Using U.S. Department of Energy data on gasoline consumption in 2016, my estimates show that 10 cents per gallon tax will increase additional tax revenue by $124.69 million in 2018, $127.18 million in 2019 and $129.73 million in 2020, assuming 2 percent growth in gasoline consumption commensurate with population growth rate in Utah. Public education requires a large infusion of resources. This ballot measure is a small but important step in the right direction.\Logically, road and education financing sources should be separated. Selective highway tolls are an efficient way to finance roads, with the additional benefit of reduced congestion and pollution. The net effect of the price increase due to the gasoline tax, the growth in income and fuel-efficient motor transportation may result in smaller additional tax revenue to meet the needs for roads and education.\A better tax, given the heavy carbon dioxide (CO2) air pollution in Utah, is the carbon tax. Because it is a broad-based tax, its burden is distributed among all activities that emit CO2. Therefore, it has a great potential to raise substantial tax revenues and reduce CO2 at the same time.\Clean air is a common property resource. Therefore, any activity that uses it as a waste repository that causes harm to others should pay the price for the resource. Air pollution due to CO2 emissions results in costly damages to industries and human beings. A CO2 tax would be a market-based solution that would incentivize emitters of CO2 to use the least-cost strategy to control emissions. However, at the same time, it has a great potential to raise revenues in the foreseeable future to finance education and roads.\Professor William Nordhaus of Yale University reported in Economist Voice, September 2010, an optimum tax in 2015 prices would be between $12 and $25 per ton of CO2. It could be increased more if some of the revenue is used to decrease other market distortionary taxes, such as income tax that discourages work or a tax on savings that distorts capital accumulation. It could be adjusted by the inflation rate per year. In Utah, annual CO2 emissions from automobiles alone are close to 5.38 million tons in 2018, assuming 2 percent growth in vehicle ownership since 2016. If appropriately implemented, the carbon tax would stimulate economic growth in Utah due to a cleaner environment.\In summary, the gas tax is narrowly focused and only indirectly addresses the issues of CO2 reductions and highway congestion and it raises meager tax revenues. Besides other features outlined above, the CO2 tax distributes the burden of the tax, lessens the burden, if accompanied by reduction of other distortionary taxes, improves efficiency in markets and raises substantial amount of revenues, even if it is only levied on fossil fuels that contribute more than 90 percent of CO2 emissions.\Vijay K.

And he says Congress hasn't discussed ways to include minority interests when ""carving up the pie"" of a proposed carbon tax that could generate $80 billion to $120 billion for the development of alternative energy.
\
Ringo made his comments at a recent business conference hosted by the Utah Office of Ethnic Affairs.
\
Michael Styles, state director of Black Affairs, said it was important to include environmentalism in the conference, especially given the emerging alternative energy market.
\
""This is a way for the ethnic minority community to get involved from the ground level,"" he said. ""This is a new industry ... it's a growing industry. I don't think it's something that has been introduced to a lot of people in the ethnic community.""
\
While environmentalism may be a new concept to many in the minority community, it's nothing new to Margene Bullcreek, who found herself butting heads with other members of the Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians over a proposed nuclear waste repository.
\
The deal was seen by many members of the band as a multimillion- dollar opportunity for economic development on the rural Tooele County reservation. The band is still pursuing that opportunity through a lawsuit against the Department of Interior, which stymied the deal.
\
After years of fighting the waste proposal, Bullcreek has turned her sights to alternative energy and has recently had a solar panel installed at her home. She said she brought the idea to the tribal council but found little interest.
\
""I think people can profit from this; they can profit from obtaining solar energy,"" she said. ""This is another direction, a new door that could be opened.""
\
In poor communities with high unemployment, there often is pressure on local officials to bring in economic development projects that promise jobs, said Robert Tohe, environmental justice organizer for the Sierra Club's Flagstaff office. At sites across the nation, poor, often low-income communities are disproportionately impacted by environmental and hazardous waste, he said.
\
""They lack the resources to even question or get assistance -- legal or advocacy -- to question projects that are dumped on them,"" Tohe said. ""Often, there's really nowhere for them to turn. That's where our program comes into effect, and so what we do is we provide some of the basic necessary tools, a way of training them on how they might start voicing their concerns.""
\
In Utah, Lawson Legate, regional director for the Sierra Club, said that while on the surface environmental and economic interests may appear disconnected, they often work hand-in-hand. He sees opportunities for development in areas such as alternative energy.
\
""Anything we can do to help a community explore alternative ways to make a living that does not threaten public health and the environment is a good thing to do,"" he said. ""We understand people have a strong desire to make a living to support their families.""

\
From constitutional amendments guaranteeing the right to hunt and fish to ballot initiatives concerning statewide plastic bag bans and the creation of a carbon-dioxide tax on industry, environmental issues were prominently featured on several states' ballots on Nov. 8.
\
Despite opposition from animal rights organizations, including People for the ethical Treatment of Animals and the Humane Society of the United States, constitutional amendments guaranteeing people the right to hunt and fish were passed by substantial majorities of voters in Indiana and Kansas. Both measures, in the words of Kansas' amendment, guaranteed, ""The people have the right to hunt, fish and trap ... subject to reasonable laws and regulations that promote wildlife conservation and management and that preserve the future of hunting and fishing.""
\
The Kansas amendment, which was approved by more than 81 percent of those voting, also designated hunting and fishing ""preferred means of managing and controlling wildlife.""
\
Indiana's amendment, which passed with support from 78 percent of voters (compared to just 19 percent who opposed), guaranteed the right to hunt and fish ""forever.""
\
With the passage of the hunting protections in Indiana and Kansas, 21 state constitutions now guarantee the right to hunt and fish. Two other state constitutions guarantee the right to fish, though not the right to hunt, and the right to hunt and fish are protected by statutes in two more states.
\
In Montana, animal rights activists failed to restrict trapping on public lands. In 2015, the Legislature passed a constitutional amendment adding trapping to Montana's previously enacted constitutional provision guaranteeing the right to hunt and fish. Activists garnered enough signatures to put a provision on the 2016 ballot to limit trapping on state lands. Sixty-three percent of Montana voters rejected the trapping limits.
\
""Glad to see sound management of species by state wildlife agencies is being maintained, informed by science based, wildlife principles, as opposed to emotional decision-making encouraged by those that don't understand how wildlife management works,"" said Ben Carter, executive director of the Dallas Safari Club. ""The North American Model of wildlife management has a proud, effective history of keeping nature and wildlife in balance.""
\
In California, 52 percent of voters narrowly approved Proposition 67, which upheld the state's ban on single-use plastic grocery bags; 48 percent of voters opposed it. The bag ban amendment passed despite the fact plastic bag bans limit consumer choice and copious evidence shows plastic bag bans don't save cities or states money, don't reduce solid waste, and could result in overall environmental harm.
\
The result did not surprise me since Californians routinely ignore actual evidence of what policies best ensure environmental protection, and instead embrace policies that project the ""image"" they are environmental saviors.
\
Also on the ballot in California was Proposition 65, to shift the revenue grocery stores currently collect from a 10-cent-per-bag fee for paper grocery bags from grocers to fund environmental programs in the state. Despite pre-election polling showing strong support for the measure, the bag fee shift failed.
\
Washington state voters rejected Initiative-732 (I-732) which would have imposed a $25-per-metric-ton tax on carbon dioxide emitted by burning fossil fuels in Washington state. Had the initiative passed, Washington would have become the first state in the nation to impose a tax on carbon emissions from fossil fuels.
\
Unsurprisingly, the business community fought the initiative. They rightly argued it would raise energy prices and harm Washington state businesses competing with out-of-state companies.
\
What surprised many people, however, was the fact many national environmental groups also opposed the carbon tax initiative, because, rather than using the funds generated to support environmental causes, I-732 aimed to be revenue neutral by reducing the state sales tax and providing up to $1,500 per year for 400,000 low-income working households.
\
The results in Washington state show what I have long argued: Many environmental lobbying groups are more concerned about gaming the system to gain more money and power over people's lives than they are about protecting the environment.
\
Except for the bag ban vote in California, I applaud the results of the election and believe the environment and common sense won in 2016.

"
106,"Utah lawmakers appear receptive to bankrolling a $2 million legal challenge against the state of California over its climate policies, which they claim unfairly penalize electricity produced with Utah coal.\California’s laws aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions make Utah’s coal a more expensive choice for generating power, industry advocates and legislators complain — and rural Utah is paying a huge price in terms of lost employment and royalties that could support the state’s schools.\“It basically costs $28 more per ton of coal than other types of energy. That’s an impossible burden for the Utah coal industry,” said Denise Dragoo, attorney for mine operator Alton Coal Development, based in Cedar City.\In hopes of reversing the trend, Rep. Mike Noel, R-Kanab, is seeking to funnel $2 million to lawyers at Dragoo’s law firm in Salt Lake City to mount a federal counter-attack in what Noel has called “California’s war on Utah coal,” on grounds its policies violate the U.S. Constitution.\Noel’s budget proposal has drawn initial support from members of the Legislature’s Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee.\At Noel’s request, Dragoo’s firm Snell & Wilmer put together a spending plan budget for its private lawyers to litigate the case in Utah’s federal court. Dragoo said she would like to file the suit within two months, but it was not clear who the plaintiff would be.\“It would be helpful to have the state of Utah involved as a plaintiff because of interstate commerce,” Dragoo said.\Her proposed budget — which calls for spending $845,000 on expert witnesses and consultants, paid $650 an hour — covers court action only through a motion for summary judgment. A trial and any appeals would boost the cost substantially, but Noel isn’t worried.\“I’m thinking we win the case and we get our money back,” he said.\‘More bark than bite’\One California environmental policy expert, however, predicted the lawsuit Noel is pushing will accomplish little, aside from enriching industry lawyers at taxpayer expense.\“This law is not new to California,” Dan Jacobson, state director for Environment California, said of the state’s cap-and-trade system, passed in 2006. “The oil industry has tried to repeal the law in legislation, in the courts and at the ballot box. They lost every single time.”\“My guess is Utah is throwing $2 million at something that has more bark than bite,” Jacobson said.\While Noel derided California leaders for setting an example of how not to run a state, Jacobson contends the Golden State’s climate policies have helped spur a green-energy revolution that other states would be wise to embrace.\“California has every right to pursue clean-energy policies… and to use its place in the market as the world’s 6th-largest economy to help move California and the rest of the world away from fossil fuels toward clean energy,” Jacobson said.\He said he suspects the lawsuit seeks to set up “a race to the bottom,” where the dirtiest fuel sources get an advantage.\California ‘way out of bounds’\Noel — whose Utah legislative district includes Alton and immense untapped coal deposits under land removed from the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument — has decried California’s emissions-reducing program as an “excise” tax that unfairly renders Utah coal uncompetitive, in violation of the Constitution’s Commerce Clause.\In testimony earlier this week, Noel argued that California is imposing its values on other states, regardless of the cost to local economies that have invested heavily in fossil-fuel extraction.\“There is a contract and we have filled that contract for years and years to supply power to the people in that area and all of the sudden their political philosophy changes, and they don’t want the power,” Noel told colleagues.\“We have geared up and put these power plants in and we have our people working and we have our coal,” he continued. “It’s cut off and they don’t give a whiff about it.”\Added Rep. Carl Albrecht, R-Richfield, “California’s law is way out of bounds,” because there is no way to distinguish between electrons generated by coal or other fuels.\“For them to determine that there is a coal-fired electron is absurd to the maximum degree,” said Albrecht, a retired utility executive.\‘Coal is not dead’\Others argue that the impact of California’s system on Utah’s coal-reliant rural economies has been substantial.\The Coal Hollow mine employed 50 miners when it began digging coal from an open pit near Alton in 2011, with most of its output going to Intermountain Power Project outside Delta to generate electricity bound for southern California.\But IPPs purchases have since dropped off and are set to completely end by 2025, casting a pall of uncertainty over the mine which expects to land a fresh 30-million-ton federal lease this year, according to Larry Johnson, general manager for Alton Coal, which operates the mine.\“We are now [producing] under 600,000 tons a year and in turn that causes us a reduction in manpower,” Johnson told legislators. “We are under 40 percent than what we started with.”\Though it is opposed by the Sierra Club and other environmental groups, the proposed lawsuit has earned letters of support from the Utah Mining Association; Bowie Resource Partners, Utah’s largest coal producer and a key supplier to IPP; Bronco Utah Operations, which runs a mine in Emery County; leaders in Kane County; and Barney Trucking, a dry-bulk hauling company in West Valley City.\Officials with the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration, or SITLA, are also back the legal action.\“Every one loves to tell you coal is dead. I can tell you coal is not dead,” said SITLA director David Ure, whose agency has acquired coal deposits in land exchanges with the federal government.\“Over the last 60 days,” Ure said, “we are having more and more people knock on our doors asking what is the availability of coal in the state of Utah, specially under trust lands.”\Ure hopes to see five new mines similar to Coal Hollow open to tap reserves on SITLA land holdings, which he says would generate $155 million in annual royalties\‘Small price to pay’\In addition to seeking legal fees and an injunction against California’s “carbon tax,” the lawsuit would also challenge another California law banning the importation of coal-fired electrons after the expiration of existing contracts, according to documents marked “confidential” that were unintentionally posted online.\North Dakota has successfully challenged a similar Minnesota law, according to Dragoo. Snell & Wilmer has assembled a legal team that includes the firm that won that case, as well as the lawyer who represented the California Chamber of Commerce in its efforts to block California’s rules.\The Utah Attorney General’s Office would oversee the litigation, but all the work would be done by outside counsel and consultants.\Sen. Jim Dabakis, D-Salt Lake City, said he was troubled that the firm recommending the suit would also get the lucrative contract to run the case. Other House committee members wanted coal companies to foot some of the bill.\But for Noel, the state’s investment could pay huge dividends given the vastness of Utah’s coal deposits that could be generating royalties and jobs.\Spending $2 million, Noel said, “to protect several hundred million in funding for the school children is a small price to pay. I’m confident in this law firm that we can win this lawsuit.”\Credit: By Brian Maffly"
107,"Where they've been tried, the evidence shows, well-designed carbon taxes have succeeded in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. But that doesn't necessarily end the debate over their effects -- nor should it. The next question is whether that success is bought at the expense of jobs and incomes.\The answer is no. As long as the tax is well-designed, it can cut emissions at little or no economic cost. And that is a conservative assessment: In practice, a carbon tax has been shown to provide an economic boost. The reason is that the revenue raised by a carbon tax can be used to cut other, more damaging, taxes.\In general, taxes make economies less efficient. But some do more harm than others. Taxing ""bads,"" such as pollution, actually improves the allocation of resources, whereas taxing ""goods,"" such as labor, reduces the economy's capacity to produce. In principle, therefore, using the revenue from a carbon tax to cut other taxes can yield a double benefit: reducing pollution and expanding the economy.\There are transition costs that have to be reckoned with. But even making allowances for them, it's plausible that carbon taxes help the economy, and not just by reducing greenhouse gases.\The evidence shows it's worked in practice, not just in theory.\A study of countries that tax carbon compared two projections for gross domestic product -- actual GDP with the tax in place, and hypothetical GDP with the equivalent revenue raised in other ways. The study found that, typically, GDP was a little higher thanks to the carbon tax.\So much for output; what about jobs? The Netherlands and Britain, which introduced some of Europe's narrowest and most targeted carbon taxes, saw no net impact on employment. Denmark made greater use of green taxes, and saw employment rise by about 0.5 percent -- again, as compared with projections assuming no introduction of a carbon tax. In Germany, employment increased an estimated 0.2 percent. A 2013 review of nine countries by the Institute for European Environmental Policy found none where a carbon tax had led to job losses.\Such estimates come with two warnings -- both of which suggest proceeding with caution. First, the economic benefits of a carbon tax can take time to come through. Second, while the economy as a whole may benefit from a carbon tax, that won't be true of every business or industry.\Energy-intensive sectors will be hit. In some countries, output of metals and minerals fell compared with what would have happened without the tax; in others, production of pharmaceuticals was reduced. In most cases, the drops were less than a tenth of 1 percent -- but they were drops nonetheless. And jobs in those industries were affected accordingly.\The debate about a carbon tax shouldn't ignore the transition costs and the more long-lasting effects on jobs and output. How the tax is phased in and how to help those most affected by it should be part of the discussion, and will be necessary to win public support for the policy. But that's not an argument against doing it. Carbon taxes can help the economy as well as the environment -- as long as the revenue is put to good use. Our next editorial in this series will turn to that crucial question of design."

Not long ago, a gallon of gasoline cost mroe than $3.80. It has now fallen to less than $2 in many areas. Few saw such a decline coming, but it creates an intriguing opportunity to take action on climate change as well as address transportation needs that depend heavily on gas taxes.
\
Despite the plummeting price of oil and gasoline, most elected officials are loath to raise the gas tax and invite public displeasure. Yet many also recognize the need to supplement falling revenues from current gas taxes and to reduce risks from climate change.
\
The current federal gas tax of 18.4 cents a gallon was set in 1993. Congress failed to index it to inflation, so revenue was destined to decline even as transportation maintenance needs grew. States gas taxes also are fairly low, averaging about 31 cents a gallon.
\
Revenues from gas taxes fell as people drove less and used more fuel-efficient vehicles. The high cost of gasoline encouraged these desirable trends, but that also meant less money for transportation infrastructure repairs.
\
Vehicle fuel efficiency is slated to increase more over the next decade, which is great news. Yet the change will further erode transportation revenue.
\
California's experience suggests what might be done. The state leads the nation in taking climate change seriously and in promoting alternatives to fossil fuels.
\
Burning those fuels in our cars, trucks, and planes is responsible for 28 percent of the country's greenhouse gas releases. Just recently, Governor Brown proposed striking new goals: cutting in half the state's use of fossil fuels in vehicles and in 15 years generating half of the state's electricity from renewable sources.
\
The component of California's policy that other states should consider is its cap-and-trade program that puts a price on use of carbon-based fuels. The state just extended it to transportation fuels. In effect, beginning on January 1 of this year, California raised its gas tax by an estimated 10 cents a gallon.
\
A carbon or greenhouse gas tax like this can be designed for different purposes. Government could add the tax to all fossil fuels, as California has done, thereby raising their price to reflect at least some of the social costs of using them, such as impacts on climate change, the environment and public health that gas prices do not now include.
\
Over time, the higher price should discourage use of fossil fuels, promote a search for alternatives and stimulate energy efficiency while also improving air quality and public health. Such a market-based policy might even appeal to political conservatives who prefer market solutions to government regulation.
\
Because the higher cost for energy can be a serious burden on many citizens, other taxes could be lowered by the same amount. That is, there need be no net increase in taxes, only a shift of taxes to carbon releases.
\
The Citizens Climate Lobby has proposed such a revenue-neutral carbon tax, which it calls a carbon fee and dividend system in which all the fees collected are returned to households as a dividend to help pay for the increased cost of fossil fuels.
\
One recent study found that the plan could reduce carbon emissions sharply, create millions of jobs, and greatly improve air quality and public health.
\
Variations on such a policy might hold even more appeal for some policymakers and the public. These include dedication of some portion of the fees to highways, mass transit, research on energy technologies or other policy goals.
\
Low gasoline prices will not last. If we're smart, we'll take advantage of current prices to build public support for increasing the gas tax and pegging it to inflation. Even better, states could enact revenue-neutral carbon taxes on all fossil fuels to help combat climate change. California shows that it can be done.

\
The most preposterous thing about a carbon tax, which California is in the process of implementing under the guise of a cap-and-trade program and which some other states are now considering, is the pretense that it will curb carbon emissions.
\
This notion - the idea that states can save the planet from getting too hot - is great soap opera, but it is just a way to bring more revenue to state governments regardless of its stated intent.
\
Whether it's called cap-and-trade or a carbon tax, California is now stuck with a fee on the carbon content of fuels. It's the first of its kind in the United States, but environmental groups are urging other states to do the same.
\
The California Air Resources Board, whose goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, claims the tax is a cost for oil refineries. But that's disingenuous.
\
Oil companies will simply pass the carbon tax along to California consumers in the form of higher prices. Experts estimate that the tax - which took effect at the start of this year - has the potential to increase gasoline prices by as much as 75 cents per gallon.
\
Guess who would pay the bill for the carbon tax? A carbon tax would disproportionately impact those who are most vulnerable in our economy - low-and-middle class families and small businesses. It would be foolish to think otherwise.
\
Make no mistake, the tax on transportation fuels will push gas and diesel prices upward and burden drivers, businesses, and schools, effectively erasing the economic benefits that Californians currently enjoy at the pump.
\
Think about its impact: To save money, some drivers may fill up at service stations in neighboring states that don't have a carbon tax.
\
And companies might be tempted to relocate elsewhere in the country to save on energy costs. Other companies might have no choice but to shut down, resulting in a loss of jobs. States without a carbon tax would gain economically at the expense of those with one.
\
In Vermont, a coalition of environmental groups has proposed a state tax of between $50 and $150 per ton of carbon emissions to be levied on businesses that distribute gasoline, heating oil, natural gas, propane and diesel. The groups claim the tax would produce $35 million in revenue by 2017 and as much as $700 million by 2030. Of the new revenues, 10 percent would automatically go to renewable energy companies.
\
State government is a great milieu for ""pass the buck"" politics, but carbon taxation is merely a way to reduce a staggering debt and reward political allies.
\
What someone like California Gov. Jerry Brown might not be able to achieve through tighter controls on spending, he can certainly gain by using public concern about climate change to ratchet up taxes. And you can be sure it won't stop at the gas pump.
\
The next target for carbon taxes could be electricity utilities and their customers. Environmentalists say it's no big deal. But fossil fuels account for about 60 percent of the nation's electricity supplies.
\
The irony is that the largest U.S. environmental groups oppose nuclear power, arguably the most important energy source in the battle against global warming.
\
The U.S. fleet of 100 nuclear plants accounts for nearly two-thirds of the nation's zero-carbon energy. But environmentalists don't recognize nuclear power's environmental value or its critically important role in maintaining a diverse mix of energy sources for reliable electricity.
\
To my mind, the path forward begins with environmentalists recognizing the importance of keeping existing nuclear plants in operation and realizing that nuclear power can collaborate well with other forms of emission-free energy such as solar and wind. If something better comes along, fine.
\
But carbon taxes should be the last resort - they won't help the environment much, they'll expand the size of government, and they'll damage the economy.

109,"
Propose a carbon tax - even a market-based, revenue-neutral tax where all proceeds are returned to taxpayers - and you can expect an outcry from conservatives about the unjust re-distribution of wealth. Of course, true conservatives should be just as emphatic regarding another more fundamental redistribution of wealth: the theft and destruction of our natural resources - the air, water and land upon which our lives depend - for private convenience and profit.
\
How is it that any driver has more right to spew exhaust than a child has to breathe clean air? A carbon tax - rather than being a re-distribution of wealth - puts responsibility for impacts to our health and environment squarely where it belongs: on those who extract and pollute. When polluters must pay, you can bet that cleaner, more efficient alternatives will appear in the marketplace before too long.
\
Surely the private welfare of current polluters and profiteers does not outweigh the inalienable right of current and future generations to enjoy continuous access to clean air and a stable climate.

In June, Pope Francis released an encyclical on ""care for our common home,"" the Earth.
\
He called climate change a ""global problem with grave implications,"" and described our response to date as woefully inadequate. He called for aggressive efforts to reduce reliance on greenhouse-emitting fossil fuels and to promote cleaner and renewable sources of energy.
\
The pope also offered a broad overview of how human actions are affecting the planet, and particularly the lives of the poorest among us, who are likely to suffer the most from a changing climate and environmental deterioration.
\
His statement comes less than six months before a major international meeting in Paris in December, when the world's leaders are to draft the next international climate change treaty.
\
The unique contribution that Pope Francis made to this debate was to add a strong moral dimension to the prevailing scientific and economic discussions of climate change and the environment. He highlighted humanity's pursuit of continued growth in material consumption at the cost of planetary health and human well-being, which he found to be morally reprehensible.
\
The pope was right to call for a more ethical sustainable development that can meet our economic needs while also protecting the environment. He was wrong, however, to fault reliance on economic incentives as a way to deal with climate change.
\
Most climate experts favor either a tax on carbon emissions or reliance on a market system for trading carbon permits, with a cap that declines over time. Both mechanisms seek to put a substantial price on carbon emissions as an effective way to change individual and corporate behavior in a market economy.
\
Pope Francis argues that markets often fail to bring out the best in us, and he is right about that. Yet moral injunctions alone cannot move societies toward a low-carbon future.
\
Markets might just do that. The higher price of carbon-based fuels should discourage their use, promote the search for alternatives, and stimulate energy efficiency and conservation.
\
Such policies rely on market mechanisms that conservatives applaud, which makes bipartisan cooperation possible.
\
Moreover, the Citizens Climate Lobby and others promote a revenue-neutral carbon tax with no net increase in taxes. Such a policy can be used in conjunction with actions such as setting national renewable energy goals, offering financial incentives for switching to non-carbon energy technologies, and establishing new regulatory standards.
\
As the case with most public problems, we can agree on the need to do something without necessarily agreeing on which policy alternatives are likely to work best or be cheapest.
\
However, it is imperative to recognize the seriousness of the problem, and Pope Francis' encyclical did exactly that by endorsing the scientific community's findings that climate change is both real and hugely important.
\
In the U.S., the Obama administration is committed to adoption of a strong international treaty at the Paris meeting. Consistent with these goals, it has raised fuel efficiency standards, supported renewable fuels and moved ahead with EPA's Clean Power Plan.
\
That plan will lower carbon emissions from existing coal-fired power plants and promote alternative fuels while giving each of the 50 states sufficient time and choice in deciding how to act.
\
Some states, most notably California, are embracing the challenge of climate change and setting goals for reducing carbon emissions.
\
California is aiming for 50 percent reliance on renewable energy by 2030. ?Unfortunately, many other states are doing little to change directions.
\
Recent surveys show that an overwhelming majority of the American public now supports action on climate change. They agree with Pope Francis.?

\
These are challenging times for some faithful Catholics such as me. Because, while I have utmost respect and love for our popular, approachable pontiff, I believe he has been sadly misinformed about climate change, as evidenced in his encyclical on the environment released in June.
\
Pope Francis is not a scientist. I do not blame him for the work's inaccuracies. Rather, I blame the Pontifical Academy of Sciences: the office responsible for advising the pope on scientific issues.
\
The encyclical states, ""On many concrete questions, the Church has no reason to offer a definitive opinion; she knows that honest debate must be encouraged among experts, while respecting divergent views.""
\
In stark contrast to this statement, only one scientist who does not accept the theory that climate change is caused by human activity was accepted to attend the Vatican seminar on climate change.
\
I am not a scientist, but I have studied and written about global warming for many years. I am what ""warmists"" now label a ""denier,"" because I am skeptical of the doomsday predictions made by extremists, such as those advising the pope.
\
The computer models used by these climate scientists have long been predicting significant warming. But for the past 18 years, actual satellite data shows no evidence of warming.
\
Science is not based on a consensus. It is based on empirical evidence. If a scientific theory does not match the evidence, then the theory must be abandoned or reconstructed. In other words, the models are wrong and provide no rational basis for any climate policy.
\
When asked by CNS News to comment on this satellite data, John Christy, a professor of atmospheric science and director of the Earth System Science Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, said: ""That's basically a fact. There's not much to comment on."" He added that basing government policy affecting millions on ""very poor"" climate models proven to be inaccurate is ""a fool's errand.""
\
Claiming, ""the science is settled,"" climate change alarmists demand urgent action to protect the planet from catastrophe. These actions include costly efforts to reduce carbon emissions by restricting, taxing and regulating fossil fuel use.
\
President Barack Obama's new Environmental Protection Agency regulations, intended to combat global warming, will do little and at great expense to Americans.
\
In an open letter to Pope Francis, a group of 90 prominent scientists, religious leaders and academics explain how substituting intermittent energy sources, like wind and solar, for constant energy sources, like fossil fuels, would be catastrophic to the world's poor.
\
Wherever implemented by government regulation, such energy sources have proven to be unreliable and unsustainable without government subsidies - and that means taxation and higher energy costs for all.
\
The open letter goes on to say: ""The poorest 1.3 billion in developing countries depend on wood and dried dung for cooking and heating fuels, smoke from which kills 4 million and debilitates millions every year. Affordable, reliable energy, such as fossil fuels, could help lift these people out of poverty, as it has lifted countless others.""
\
In an annual message for World Peace Day, Francis' predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, said the world needed to care for the environment, but not to the extent where the welfare of plants and animals was given a greater priority than mankind.
\
Neither pope, in addressing environmental issues, was speaking ex cathedra. That is, neither was making an infallible pronouncement. So, as faithful Catholics, we are free to disagree on climate change.

"
111," WASHINGTON -- After two years' work, a blue-ribbon panel of business, government and science leaders says that the United States must reject the ""false dichotomy"" of jobs vs. environmental protection and adopt sweeping policy changes to link the pursuits of economic and environmental health.\ Toward that end, the report of the National Commission on the Environment, being offered to President-elect Clinton as a blueprint for his administration, recommends that the federal government adopt tax policies to stimulate ""green"" research and development.\ And it calls for the elimination of price-distorting subsidies, for taxes on environmentally harmful activities and more realistic means of calculating economic activity.\ More specifically, it says the United States should increase -- gradually and predictably -- gasoline taxes over a period of several years, enact a carbon tax to be phased in gradually, and reduce or eliminate water subsidies to growers.\ In its specifics, the commission's recommendations are similar to many that environmentalists have called for before in reports and conferences ranging from community meetings to last summer's Earth Summit in Brazil.\ But the work is apt to receive special attention in the new administration because of the makeup of the panel, which was convened and funded by the World Wildlife Fund.\ Chaired by former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Russell E. Train, it included executives from such companies as Southern California Edison and Alcoa, along with officials and prospective appointees of the Clinton administration. Among them were Alice M. Rivlin, newly named deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, former Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin, a close Clinton adviser during the campaign and transition, and James G. Speth, a Clinton adviser for the environment and natural resources.\ Among its key recommendations, the commission said the United States should:\ -- Adopt tax credits or other research-and-development incentives to stimulate savings and investment in new environmental technologies.\ -- ""Gradually and predictably"" increase the federal tax on gasoline -- by perhaps 20 cents a gallon annually for five years.\ -- Enact a carbon tax, starting at about $6 per ton and eventually reaching $30 per ton, to discourage the use of fossil fuels that cause serious pollution.\ Despite the political influence of their proponents, some of the recommendations would appear to face a bleak future.\ A prime example is the suggested increase in the federal gasoline tax. The concept was sharply opposed by Clinton when it was suggested by former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas during the Democratic primaries and later by industrialist Ross Perot.\ Train conceded that it was ""highly unlikely that either the administration or Congress will jump to embrace our recommendation.""\ It will take time, he added, ""before the country at large or politicians are ready to bite that kind of a bullet.""\ Train said he hopes the recommendations will be discussed during the economic summit in Little Rock, Ark., next week and will be the subject of congressional hearings early next year.\ Unless there is official recognition of the major themes suggested by the commission, he added, the environment will decline and ""life is going to become of increasingly low quality on this planet.""\ ""The choice between crisis and sustainable development,"" the commission counsels, ""is one that our nation shares with the rest of the world. It must be addressed through international cooperation and by U.S. commitment to action at home and leadership abroad."""

As the mean world temperature slowly rises, the political heat for reduction of energy consumption is beginning to simmer. Governors and mayors are making gestures of leadership. With the recent rock extravaganza devoted to energy conservation, can political action be far behind?
\
To date, environmental advocates have relied on moral admonitions to reduce our carbon footprint -- use fluorescent lights, drive hybrids, be organic -- and politicians have trotted out the usual painless panaceas of new technologies and tax breaks to go green. But if the temperature continues to rise or even if it is perceived to be rising, the choice is going to come down to direct regulation of carbon use or to higher prices of oil and coal to compensate for their costs to the environment. The higher prices could be the result of a carbon tax or a market for CO2 emission permits or some other device that would internalize the worldwide external cost from the use of fossil fuels.
\
Neither regulation nor higher energy prices are likely to be attractive to politicians, but experience suggests they will choose regulation given the powerful organized forces that favor regulation. This fundamental choice between the use of price and regulation to solve global warming could be the most important economic decision of coming decades.
\
The justice lobby will favor regulation. Price rationing invariably raises the issues of fairness and inequality. The poor will not only be choosing between food and prescription drugs, they will be choosing between food and heat in the winter or cool in the summer.
\
Those who make their living through a bigger and more powerful government will also favor direct regulation. Whatever else could be said about direct regulation, we can be sure that it increases the demand for regulators and for those who are paid to influence the regulators. The political sentiment against regulation will have to be strong to stave off the political class's natural tendencies.
\
Somewhat surprisingly, environmental activists also seem to be drawn to regulation rather than price change. Their ambivalence about price change comes from the moral dimension of the global warming movement. To the environmental moralists, no one should be allowed to drive that big SUV, even if they have to pay more to do it. No one should be allowed to indulge the taste for a long hot shower.
\
With a coalition of the fairness lobby, the bigger government lobby and the environmental moralists all favoring regulation and a growing perception that we must do something, direct control of our energy consumption seems to be in our future even though it would be a profound policy mistake. The market for energy feeds into all other markets. Mistakes in the energy market translate into mistakes everywhere. The price of energy may be even more important than the interest rate in decisionmaking.
\
Market-determined prices, including those with a tax or cap and trade intervention, have two very attractive features. First, prices deliver a higher level of efficiency in the economy because every household and business can key off of the same set of prices. Second and most important, prices give us the freedom to make our own decisions subject to the proviso that we pay the price.
\
There will be constant moralizing about energy use. If we choose government regulation over higher prices, we will undoubtedly suffer from a less-efficient economy. But more significantly, we will give up some of our freedom. No one likes higher prices. But I would rather live free with higher energy prices than die from a thousand petty regulations and moral homilies.

113,"
In a thinly disguised assault on coal and hydrocarbons, the Obama administration would have us believe that carbon dioxide (CO2) is a threat to life itself.
\
Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, a recent study by my company for the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity found that the benefits of carbon dioxide to all of us are far greater than its costs.
\
The government bases many of its regulatory positions on the so-called social cost of carbon, an estimate of climate change damages in a given year. However, our study showed the government positions were based on flawed science:
\
There is no scientific evidence for significant climate effects of rising CO2 levels and there is no evidence that global warming will produce catastrophic climate changes.
\
There has been no global warming for two decades, during which CO2 emissions increased significantly. The only ""evidence"" comes from invalidated climate models that disagree with each other and that are increasingly inaccurate.
\
The government is exaggerating climate sensitivity and relies on unsubstantiated claims of international reports.
\
The government data, we believe, are artificial constructs designed by the Obama administration to penalize fossil fuels and allow it to achieve by executive mandate what it cannot via Congress, such as a carbon tax.
\
In fact, we found the ""social cost of carbon"" to be a concept dependent on assumptions and allows its user to arrive at almost any desired result. Dire climate-related occurrences are not happening. For example: Sea level rise is modest, and there is no cause and effect from CO2. There is no indication of increased extreme weather events. Sea ice is not melting; rather, it has increased to a record high in the Antarctic. There has been no change in the frequency or severity of floods worldwide. Nor are droughts becoming more severe.
\
Carbon dioxide is the basis of life on Earth. It facilitates plant growth and enhances agricultural productivity. It is the primary raw material utilized by plants, which are the food source for animals and humans. The more CO2 there is in the air, the better plants grow.
\
Our study found that the economic value of this CO2 benefit totaled $3.2 trillion from 1961 to 2011. It also forecast that over the period 2012-2050, these CO2 benefits will total $10 trillion.
\
Finally, there are obvious benefits of using fossil fuels. These fuels facilitated successive industrial revolutions, launched the modern world and ensure the livelihoods, living standards, health and longevity we all currently enjoy.
\
Over the past 200 years, largely due to hydrocarbon energy, world population increased eight-fold, incomes rose 11-fold and life expectancy more than doubled. At the same time, CO2 emissions increased and atmospheric concentration rose from 320 parts per million to 400 parts per million.
\
Hydrocarbons provide 81 percent of world energy and the positive relationship between fossil fuels, economic growth and CO2 emissions is strong - supporting $70 trillion per year in world GDP. Our study verified previous research that concluded, ""Ours is a high energy civilization based largely on fossil fuels.""
\
How do CO2's benefits compare to potential damage? We found that CO2's benefits outweigh costs by literally, orders of magnitude - anywhere from 50-to-1 to 220-to-1.
\
Normally, benefit/cost ratios of 2-to-1 or 3-to-1 are considered very favorable. In other words, our research concluded that CO2 benefits overwhelmingly outweigh estimated CO2 costs.
\
All major forecasts predict that, for decades to come, there will continue to be a close link between energy and the economy and that fossil fuels will continue to provide about 80 percent of world energy. Our study found that the benefits of fossil fuel utilization will continue to outweigh - by orders of magnitude - any conceivable costs.
\
The government estimates are wrong. If the world is serious about economic growth, poverty reduction, higher living standards and affordable energy, fossil fuels are essential. Restrictions on hydrocarbon energy based on flawed science only undermine progress in these areas.

The leaders of the United States and China are right: it is worth the effort to reduce CO2 emissions. President Barack Obama made that commitment in November as part of a U.S.-China agreement to adopt measures limiting greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades - a 26-28 percent cut relative to 2005 levels by 2025 for the United States.
\
First, the target is not as ambitious as it sounds. From 2005 to 2012, national emissions dropped by 10 percent with virtually no national CO2 policy. Second, continuing that trend by instituting a carbon tax could bring our country enormous benefits - even if we entirely ignore the benefits related to climate change.
\
The public finance argument for a carbon tax starts with an important observation. Taxes interfere with price signals and consequently distort the market, thereby imposing a social cost, referred to by economists as excess burden. A well-designed tax system minimizes the excess burden on society.
\
A 2011 study by economists at Resources for the Future points to an opportunity for a win-win change in our tax system. They demonstrate that a tax of $33 per ton of carbon dioxide - about 25 cents on a gallon of gas and less than a couple cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity - could simultaneously reduce U.S. carbon emissions by 8.5 percent and save the economy $4.5 billion per year, even ignoring climate benefits.
\
The key to the savings? Congress must reduce income taxes by the same amount as the revenue raised from the carbon tax; it must resist the temptation to earmark the funds for pet projects.
\
Critics who claim that carbon taxes are bad for the economy miss an important point: under the current structure, taxes on income and capital are even worse. In the words of Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, we need smarter taxes, not higher taxes.
\
Our tax system would benefit further if we zeroed out inefficient fossil fuel extraction subsidies. Estimates vary widely, but these appear to be in the range of $5 billion per year.
\
A push to reduce CO2 emissions will have tremendous co-benefits as well, particularly in the areas of health and natural environment. For example, a recent study from Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory demonstrated that efforts to reduce greenhouse gases would also reduce emissions of particulate matter that enters peoples' lungs and bloodstreams.
\
According to their estimates, a program to reduce national emissions could yield health benefits of between $40 and $93 per ton, well in excess of even high estimates of the cost of achieving the reductions.
\
Indeed, in EPA's impact analysis of its recent CO2 regulations for the power sector, the estimates of health benefits - $45 billion in 2030 - vastly exceeded either the estimates of domestic benefits from climate mitigation - less than $3 billion - or costs - $9 billion.
\
Recent analysis by economist Ian Parry and his colleagues indicates that even without counting the climate impacts, coal and natural gas have negative impacts on health, the environment and the economy of approximately $25 dollars per ton of CO2 they emit.
\
For diesel and gasoline that figure exceeds $100 dollars. They calculate that the nationally efficient CO2 price would be in the range of $35 dollars per ton.
\
An effort to reduce CO2 emissions would also bring with it greater energy security as we reduce our fossil energy use and create incentives to further develop alternative and renewable sources of energy.
\
It would improve our standing in the international community, establishing us once again as leaders in the field of environmental stewardship. And with the recent dip in world oil prices, as former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers pointed out, now is the time to implement a carbon tax, when the barriers to adjustment will be lowest.

"
114," The federal government is short on cash. Since nobody in Washington seems to know how to cut spending, additional revenues are needed. But the ""T"" word -- taxes -- is something few politicians are willing to talk about. Still, opinion polls suggest that ordinary Americans are willing to sacrifice in order to trim the federal deficit, provided the sacrifice is shared. That's why we've seen all the trial balloons floated by the Clinton administration concerning an energy tax of some kind.\ Though nobody is talking yet about exactly what form the tax will take, other than to say it will be a ""broad-based consumption tax,"" at least four different proposals are being considered: 1, a Btu tax (based on heat content) on all fuels, across the board; 2, a carbon tax on all fossil fuels, with the more polluting fuels being taxed at a higher rate than the cleaner alternatives; 3, an increase in the federal gasoline tax; and 4, an energy security fee on all imported oil and petroleum products.\ The first idea, a Btu tax, is a terrible one. Based solely on heat content, it would raise all energy prices, giving no consideration to such broader issues as the relative cleanness of a particular fuel, its domestic availability, whether it has to be imported from unstable regions of the world, or any of the other energy policy questions that have been overlooked for more than a decade. All it would do is raise federal revenues. And the cost to the economy would be great. Indications are that a Btu tax would be collected on utility bills, placing the greatest hardship on the poor, the elderly and the middle class, the very groups President Clinton has pledged to help.\ Hiking the federal tax on gasoline is another bad idea. True, such a move would raise revenues and encourage some conservation, but the trouble with this proposal is that it is patently unfair. The burden of higher gasoline taxes again would fall most heavily upon the poor, the elderly and the middle class. Corporate America, by and large, would be spared, since their non-transportation energy costs would be unaffected.\ The carbon tax proposal makes some sense in that, if structured properly, it would reward the cleaner fuels -- such as natural gas -- with low taxes, while punishing the worst environmental offenders -- such as coal -- with high assessments. However, one flaw of this proposal is that it would let nuclear power off scot free, since reactor fuels contain no carbon. This hardly seems fair, when one considers the fact that long-term disposal of radioactive wastes is a serious environmental problem that hasn't even begun to be addressed in any meaningful way.\ By far the best idea under consideration is an energy security fee on imported oil and petroleum products. It would raise revenues, but fairly, with all parts of society paying their share. It would reduce our dependence on foreign oil -- which presently costs the nation $60 billion a year -- and thereby improve our trade balance. It would halt the exportation of jobs that continues to occur as oil companies give up on America and invest instead in overseas exploration and development activity. It would help the environment by lowering oil imports, which in turn would reduce the likelihood of catastrophic spills by super tankers plying U.S. waters. The energy security fee also would make clean-burning, domestically abundant natural gas more competitive with imported oil.\ Right now, foreign oil suppliers get free access to our market. The oil they land on our shores is sold at a price that fails to recognize the millions upon millions in tax dollars we spend each year to keep the Persian Gulf supply lines open. These defense expenditures, considered against the amount of oil America gets from that troubled region, amount to a $100-per-barrel subsidy of Arab OPEC, the major oil companies which operate in that part of the world, and our trade competitors who rely on the region for a much greater percentage of their oil supplies than we in the United States do.\ Foreign oil suppliers also have a competitive advantage over domestic producers in that they are not subject to the many environmental and worker safety rules that add to the cost of doing business in the United States. An energy security fee on imported oil would help level the playing field.\ If you examine the various energy tax proposals in detail, one and only one rises to the top as a clear winner for America and the American people. The energy security fee is the most equitable -- and it makes the most sense from a broad policy perspective because it attacks a wide variety of problems in addition to the federal deficit.\ A decision from Washington is imminent. Americans who are concerned about jobs, the federal deficit, the trade imbalance, foreign oil dependence, the economy in general, the environment and their pocketbooks should let the president and Congress know that they support the smart choice: an energy security fee on all imported oil and petroleum products.\George P. Mitchell is chairman and president of Mitchell Energy & Development Corp., in The Woodlands, Texas."
115,"Voters in Washington state will be asked next month whether they want to adopt the nation's first carbon tax ccc a powerful way to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. You'd think environmental groups would be doing everything they can to back that idea. You'd be wrong.\Initiative 732 will be on the ballot on Election Day. It calls for a $25-per-ton carbon tax, and it says how the proceeds should be spent: Trim the state's sales tax, cut taxes on manufacturers, and give tax rebates to low-income households.\Oddly enough, this plan has failed to impress some environmental campaigners. Washington Conservation Voters, an influential local organization, opposes it because none of the revenue will go toward funding clean energy. Climate Solutions, another local group, agrees. The Sierra Club won't back the plan, saying its help for low-income households and minorities is insufficient.\Those groups haven't put their own proposal on the ballot, so they're saying it's better to do nothing than vote for Initiative 732. This position is absurd. Curbing carbon emissions is, or ought to be, the primary goal, and the plan would do that. In addition, it's an opportunity to prove the viability of the carbon-tax approach and set a valuable example for the rest of the country.\The part of the plan that seems to offend the campaigners ccc how the carbon-tax revenues ought to be used ccc is worth debating, but what matters most is to put a price on carbon, reflecting its true cost to the environment. Promising that the revenues from the carbon tax will be used to cut taxes and support low-income working families seems wise, in fact, because it lends the idea bipartisan appeal. But that isn't the main thing. The main thing is that the measure shouldn't fail merely because it doesn't please every group on every point.\The latest polling shows 42 percent of respondents supporting the plan, with 37 percent against and 21 percent undecided. In other words, local groups could well decide the outcome, persuading undecided voters to lean one way or the other. It would be bad enough for the measure to be voted down because climate change wasn't seen as an urgent problem. If it fails for lack of support from climate campaigners, that's worse ccc and those groups should be ashamed."
116,"Rep. John Curtis wants praise for his recognition of the reality, and extreme danger, of climate change. Rather, he deserves scorn and derision for his abject failure to take bold action to combat it.\Human frailties include denial and stupidity, and that is especially true of Republicans with regard to climate change. Even Curtis himself acknowledges the denial by most Republicans.\Curtis is especially deserving of criticism for his lack of courage to take the decisive and, yes, politically risky, steps to begin tangible action against climate change. As a powerful, elected Republican who sees the light, his lack of fortitude is especially tragic.\The metaphor that comes to mind is a group of religious zealots who believe their deity will suddenly enable them to fly if they jump off a cliff — except one of the zealots knows there will be no deity rescue, and a tragedy looms, but does nothing to stave off the disaster. Curtis knows strong action is needed, but all he is providing is happy talk about innovation and adapting to climate change’s impact.\Curtis is also a believer in market forces and the power of incentives. He is correct about the strength and effectiveness of market forces.\Let’s connect the dots: Carbon is bad because its causes climate change. Climate change has huge adverse costs for all of humanity. When we burn coal and oil for power, the resulting carbon causes expensive and deadly harm, but the cost of that carbon damage is not included in the cost of the fuel we burn.\The true cost of a gallon of gas is not just the cost to extract, refine and transport the gasoline, i.e., the price we pay at the pump. Embedded in that gasoline is the cost to our environment, and our well-being, of burning that gas. But we, as consumers, currently aren’t being charged for the full cost of that gasoline.\Is there a Republican originated, market-oriented solution to this? Well, it turns out there is. It’s called “The Conservative Case for Carbon Dividends.” Its authors include Reagan-era stalwarts George Shultz and James Baker. It says if we tax carbon, to take into account its true cost, thereby making it more expensive, market forces will respond and there will be less carbon spewed into our air and water. It’s simply Economics 101.\This policy paper goes on to propose that all the money generated from the carbon tax be distributed to all Americans as a dividend. So Curtis and his colleagues can’t complain that this is a backdoor plan to expand government. Allowing market forces to figure out the best way to reduce carbon emissions is far superior to blunt-force regulations.\In my view, the carbon tax should be high, because action is urgently needed. And the dividends to all Americans from the carbon tax collections might even provide a much-needed mechanism to reduce economic inequality.\So why isn’t Curtis advocating, at the top of his lungs, The Conservative Case for Carbon Dividends? I believe there is only one answer: The proposal includes the ""T"" word, taxes.\It doesn’t seem to matter to most Republicans that a carbon tax will provide incentives to reduce climate change and possibly reduce inequality. It’s still a tax, and to the Republican mind, all taxes are bad. I believe Curtis fears a primary challenge on the right, and the loss of his seat in Congress, if he were to advocate a carbon tax. Curtis himself acknowledges that if he even mentions climate change, his wife receives frantic calls from callers upset that Curtis is now in league with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\But this is the time to be bold, even at personal political risk. With all of the storms, droughts, floods, famines and plagues the world is currently experiencing, it’s time to conclude that one’s personal political prospects don’t outweigh telling hard truths and making a best effort to start the process to save our planet.\Eric Rumple lives in Sandy.

Sen. Mike Lee has the opportunity to carve out his name in history and to lead the Republican Party. The GOP has offered scorn toward President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan but has struggled to suggest alternative policies to combat climate change. The lack of solutions proposed is a mistake for the Republican Party. Obama's proposal is flawed and the GOP has the opportunity to establish a free market conservative approach to replace this plan. The Republican Party has the exciting opportunity to lead on the issue of climate change and Lee is the perfect candidate to take charge.
\
Lee is in as good a position as any to learn about the effects of climate change. In Utah, Lee can easily seek the counsel of Dr. Rob Davies of Utah State University or any of the other top-notch scientists at Utah State's climate center. With his vantage point in Utah, Lee must bear witness to the damage caused to the trees in our mountain range by insects given longer life by climate change. And as a senator focused on economic growth in Utah, Lee has the motivation to limit climate change before our ski industry, health and water supply are put in even greater danger.
\
Lee is chairman of the Senate Republican Steering Committee and has written and spoken boldly on ""the need for a conservative reform agenda."" Climate change is a 21st-century challenge that a modern conservative agenda must address. Lee recognizes that the GOP can't merely be a party of ""no,"" but a party of ideas. A carbon tax, with the revenue returned equally to households, fits into a new conservative path. A carbon tax would help protect the poor and middle class from climate change without the need for government regulations. Returning the revenue to citizens keeps money in the hands of families instead of Washington bureaucrats. Other methods of addressing climate change certainly exist, but Lee has options to address climate change in a conservative framework.
\
The opportunity that climate change represents to the Republican Party goes beyond setting the global-warming agenda. Both sides of the political aisle recognize that some government action is necessary for the environment. However, the regulatory, intrusive approach to modern environmentalism is not necessary. The idea of taxing away environmental problems has been shown by economics research to be cost-efficient and environmentally effective. The International Monetary Fund projects that tackling climate change with a carbon tax would cause little economic harm and would limit the damage of climate change. With environmental taxes replacing some regulations, we can move to a country more guided by the free market than controlled by the government. By acting now, Lee has the opportunity to move U.S. environmental policy in a conservative direction that saves U.S. families money.
\
Climate change is a concern that could damage Utahns. However, it is also an opportunity for the Republican Party to create a new environmental policy standard that shrinks government and poverty while protecting the earth. As a conservative, principled senator from a state threatened by serious effects of climate change, Lee is in a promising position to tackle climate change and transform his party. All young senators wish to make a mark in history; a conservative solution to climate change could be Lee's day in the history books.

118,"President Obama unveiled the final version of his signature climate change policy on Monday, to aggressive attack and enthusiastic cheering. The cheering is on target: Obama's Clean Power Plan will be the single largest action the country has taken to combat global warming. It sets an important example for other nations; draft rules on the table before Monday already had helped galvanize climate commitments from other major polluting nations.\It remains true, though, that this is a second-best plan, for both the environment and the economy. Congress left the president with no better option. In a rational world, legislators would take this as an opportunity for debate ccc not about whether the country must cut its greenhouse emissions but about how to do it better, more cheaply and for the long term.\Within the complex legal world of the Clean Air Act, the law in which the administration found its authority to regulate, the president's plan is about as flexible as possible. The regulations assign each state an emissions target but allow each to design its own program to achieve the target.\Most important, the president's plan encourages states to create rudimentary market-based emissions programs in which companies can buy and sell pollution credits. This is the most efficient way to reduce pollution, ensuring that emissions cuts happen where they are cheapest. States could join interstate greenhouse-gas trading blocs or they could allow companies to participate in interstate trading without such a formal move. State leaders should look at these options and begin talks with each other sooner rather than later.\What are the drawbacks? First, the plan covers only one sector ccc power generation ccc which accounts for a third of the nation's greenhouse emissions. Second, the plan is only a medium-term policy, when some of the hardest emissions-cutting work will have to come after 2030. Third, the plan is complex and requires close supervision from Washington, when policies that rely less on federal mandates would be simpler.\Congress could address all three failings with a simple, economy-wide, market-based, long-term strategy that could credibly replace the president's Clean Power Plan. A federal carbon tax or a national carbon trading program would do the trick. Until and unless critics of the president's plan get behind a policy like that, their attacks will remain unconvincing."
119,"One of the world's biggest energy companies also is a big backer of putting a price on carbon.\On Wednesday, Rio Tinto, the parent company of Kennecott, will tell the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming why it wants sensible climate-change regulation -- whether a carbon tax, cap-and-trade or some other pollution-fighting policy -- to bring more certainty to its business.\Preston Chiaro, who oversees Rio Tinto's Technology & Innovation Group from a Salt Lake Valley office, said the international mining company is eager for more predictability -- and soon -- so that it can plan for the future. The company has tried to figure carbon pricing into its strategy for more than a decade, he added, amid mounting scientific evidence of human-caused climate disruption.\""These changes are happening. They sure seem to be caused by human emissions, and we think that at some point governments will act,"" Chiaro said. ""We, as a business, have to figure out how we can survive and succeed in that changing world. We ultimately think there will be a price on carbon.""\Rio Tinto has a lot on the line. The company reported worldwide revenues of $41.8 billion last year and profits of $4.9 billion. It boasts 65,000 employees. In Utah, its largest enterprises are the Bingham Canyon copper mine and Kennecott Land development.\Last fall, Chiaro warned the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works that Rio Tinto sees unmanaged climate change as ""a threat to our assets, our shareholders and our employees, and also to civil society and political institutions in many of the countries in which we operate across the globe.""\The company is the only coal producer in the 14-member U.S. Climate Action Partnership, a coalition of major companies and environmental groups.\Not only is Rio Tinto concerned about higher costs for energy required to run its business, but it also sees opportunities to sell more commodities, such as copper and aluminum, that could be used in climate-control technologies.\Energy industry lobbyist Frank Maisano said he expects at least part of Wednesday's hearing to shift its attention to industry-safety issues after the recent deaths of 29 miners in West Virginia.\""This is going to put a big spotlight back on [Rep. Ed] Markey's committee,"" Maisano said, by focusing on the news of the day rather than climate legislation.\Utah Rep. Roger Barrus, R-Centerville, said he hasn't heard about Kennecott or other Utah companies calling for carbon regulation. He said he has heard just the opposite.\""I wish we could move forward without putting a value on carbon,"" Barrus said. ""The question of [regulation certainty] is on everybody's mind, but that's just not the kind of certainty most Utah companies want, because they don't want to be taxed twice, once on carbon and once on technology"" to control it.\Dianne Nielson, Gov. Gary Herbert's energy adviser, agrees that Rio Tinto's view is uncommon in Utah. She pointed to testimony and legislative measures earlier this year, including a resolution opposing federal efforts to regulate carbon emissions.\Instead of looking to state and federal government to address climate change, she noted, many have opted to do what they can on their own.\""There's quite a bit that can be accomplished,"" Nielson said, ""by individuals as well as companies that are interested in doing something.""\Hearing set\The House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming will hear from coal industry representatives Wednesday morning in Washington, D.C.\Credit: By Judy Fahys The Salt Lake Tribune"

GREEN BAY, Wis. - The past year has brought increasing and definitive evidence of climate change and the impacts it can have on the United States and the rest of the world. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its latest report, providing exhaustive details about the world's changing climate and its causes. It concluded that warming of the climate system is ""unequivocal.""
\
It found atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased to levels that are ""unprecedented"" over the last 800,000 years. It also concluded that ""human influence on the climate system is clear,"" and that limiting climate change ""will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.""
\
Climate change skeptics dismissed this latest IPCC report as they have previous ones. Yet during the past year other independent studies reached the same conclusions.
\
One is the National Climate Assessment, which told us that climate change already is having effects all over the United States, from torrential rain storms and flooding in the Southeast to heat waves, droughts and wildfires in the Southwest and West.
\
Another study, The Risky Business Project, with bipartisan leadership, concluded that if the nation continues on its current path, ""many regions of the U.S. face the prospect of serious economic effects from climate change.""
\
However, it found that if we act aggressively to adapt to the changing climate and mitigate future impacts by cutting carbon emissions, we can reduce our exposure to these economic risks.
\
Any reasonable person reviewing these and other studies would conclude that it is very much in our own economic and national security interest to take action now; not just at some indefinite future time. Yet elected officials show little enthusiasm for action, many Republicans continue to deny the reality of climate change, and the fossil fuel industry stoutly resists any change. Why is there such a reluctance to act?
\
For one thing, the American public demonstrates little sense of urgency. Recently, we have seen the United Nations Climate Summit, the massive People's Climate March in New York City, and several thousand ""solidarity"" events in other cities in 166 countries.
\
Yet climate change was not a significant issue in the midterm elections. It needs to become far more salient to the public, and people must convey their concerns and support for action to public officials.
\
To his credit, President Barack Obama has achieved much through his executive authority. This includes setting higher vehicle fuel efficiency standards, investing in new energy technologies, and pushing for Environmental Protection Agency regulation of coal-fired power plants that account for a large percentage of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Many states and cities also have taken action to reduce emissions and to plan seriously to mitigate the impacts of climate change. We need to do much more.
\
Energy experts, economists, many business leaders and investors advocate use of a national revenue-neutral carbon tax as the most efficient way to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
\
Such a policy puts a meaningful price on the use of carbon, and it could be used in combination with other steps, such as setting national renewable energy goals for utilities, offering financial incentives for switching to non-carbon energy technologies and establishing regulatory standards as needed.
\
The higher price of carbon-based fuels should discourage their use, promote the search for alternative fuels and stimulate energy efficiency. Just as important, this policy relies on the market mechanisms that conservatives and Republicans applaud, which makes bipartisan cooperation at least plausible. Such a policy is good for business and good for the U.S. economy.
\
Much of the world already endorses such a shift. Some states already have acted. Now the nation needs to do so as well and now. We are running out of time.

FLINT, Mich. - Is there any doubt there are already too many environmental regulations?
\
A recent government report found that the total regulatory costs in the United States amount to almost $2 trillion annually, twice as much as all individual income taxes collected each year.
\
Consider the Environmental Protection Agency's rule requiring states to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent on average by 2030: Compliance will cost a fortune, while destroying an untold number of jobs. The rest of the world isn't imposing carbon regulations, so the EPA rules make America less competitive internationally, while the rest of the world benefits at our expense.
\
Technological innovation is already reducing emissions quicker and more efficiently than heavy-handed government regulation ever could. We must put climate action in the real world of strategies that are more effective and less costly than regulation, which usually results in time-consuming legal challenges.
\
Evidence shows that proper incentives combined with ingenuity, when manifest in companies competing for a share of the market in low-carbon energy, can drive technological advances of world-changing originality and scale. The textbook case is the production of shale gas.
\
Thanks to the shale revolution, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have dropped sharply since 2007. Meanwhile, the dramatic increase in natural gas production - which has happened as a result of technological advances in fracking - turned a gas shortage into a surplus of cheap, low-carbon gas for electricity production, heating and manufacturing. New revolutionary advances in fracking have done more to reduce emissions than any other activity.
\
Consider the efficiency gains in natural gas production. The amount of natural gas produced per rig in the Marcellus region has increased eight-fold since 2009.
\
New rigs are capable of more lateral boring and drilling more wells per pad, resulting in greater production. Some boring devices can even ""walk"" short distances to drill a new well. The increased mobility eliminates the time that would have been spent disassembling and reassembling rigs.
\
Advances and efficiency gains in shale production could prove promising for the spread of the shale revolution overseas. Witness China's eagerness to obtain U.S. assistance developing its own vast shale-gas resources.
\
How about solar energy? Ingenuity and capital are being focused on the development of solar energy, with promising results. The average price for a utility-scale photovoltaic project has dropped more than 50 percent over the last three years, according to the Department of Energy.
\
In fact, solar energy is now becoming competitive with average grid costs across the country. With enough breakthroughs, solar could eventually become a dependable source of electricity.
\
But solar and other renewable energy sources alone can't get us where we need to be soon enough. We need other low-carbon sources, and one of the best options is nuclear power.
\
The environmental movement has done more harm with its opposition to nuclear power than anything else. This is the kind of irrational thinking that hampers efforts to address climate change.
\
Zero-carbon nuclear power accounts for nearly two-thirds of America's emission-free energy, and it's reliable and affordable. Without nuclear power, it might be impossible to reduce greenhouse emissions significantly. Fortunately, five new reactors are under construction in the U.S., and more are being built and planned in other countries.
\
It is time to end the delusional thinking that moving faster in the direction of heavy-handed government regulation is the best and most cost-effective way to address climate change.
\
Instead, we need to start thinking more realistically about market-based technological solutions to our environmental challenges. In short, approaches that use market-driven innovative technologies would help both the economy and environment, and that's an outcome that would benefit the United States and the world.

121,"Nearly all of Utah’s candidates for governor recognize that humans are contributing to the planet’s changing climate, a promising sign to environmental advocates that global warming is becoming less of a wedge issue.\Republican and Democratic rivals who completed a voter guide survey for The Salt Lake Tribune also articulated ambitious plans for purifying the air and decreasing emissions if they win the state’s highest executive post.\Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox and former Gov. Jon Huntsman wrote about adding charging stations to the state’s network, easing the “range anxiety” that discourages drivers from buying electric cars. Salt Lake County Councilwoman Aimee Winder Newton stressed the importance of getting older, more polluting cars off the road. And University of Utah professor Chris Peterson said he’d want to lead Utah toward a net-zero carbon future.\“We’re at this turning point, really, in terms of the carrying weight of the resources of this state,” said Scott Williams, executive director of HEAL Utah, an environmental advocacy group. “And so we can’t be all driving our cars everywhere. We can’t all be living on quarter-acre lots. We can’t all be driving trucks.”\That’s why it’s critical for the state’s next governor to lead on emissions targets and in careful planning for the anticipated population boom, Williams added.\Only one candidate who participated in The Tribune’s survey said he didn’t believe human activity is causing climate change. Former House Speaker Greg Hughes wrote that saying people are causing the planet to warm “would suggest that absent any humans, the climate wouldn’t change. That is not the case.\“Can we be good stewards of the environment and adopt practices that prevent harming the environment?” he continued. “Of course. It isn’t a theory, it’s what we are doing now and what we must continue doing.”\Learn more about the gubernatorial candidates’ positions on the environment, health, education and taxes in The Salt Lake Tribune’s online voter guide, at www.sltrib.com/utah-governor-2020.\Williams said he was pleasantly surprised that the other candidates were comfortable acknowledging human involvement in climate change — just 10 years ago, the Utah Legislature passed a resolution that attributed concerns over global warming to “climate change alarmists” who were supposedly leading a conspiracy.\Since then, the sentiment of the Republican-dominated state leadership has shifted, and Williams said momentum for improving air quality and reducing emissions has built under the administration of Gov. Gary Herbert. Now, he said, it’s time to take the next steps.\Willing to set goals\While businessman Jeff Burningham said he does want to reduce emissions, he’s crystal clear about one thing: He wouldn’t do it by taxing carbon.\“I will veto any carbon tax legislation that comes to my desk,” Burningham said.\Emissions will continue to drop as people replace their older, more polluting cars with newer, cleaner models, he said. And the state could potentially remove thousands of vehicles from highways each day by permitting more employees to work from their homes, he added.\Jan Garbett, by contrast, said she would explore “instituting a carbon tax in conjunction with our neighboring states,” with the idea of providing a dividend for Utah families. She also said she would set a goal of reducing air pollution by 50% by 2026.\Huntsman noted that during his administration, he instituted a four-day workweek for state employees, estimating the initiative prevented upward of 24,000 round-trip commutes each week. That policy has been largely dismantled in recent years.\Huntsman suggested that upgrading the engines for Utah Transit Authority’s FrontRunner trains should be part of the state’s plan, along with adding capacity to the state’s transit system. State leaders should also invest in the electric vehicle charging network — a priority also mentioned by Cox, who said these charging stations should be “as accessible as gasoline.”\Cox added that the state should convert its fleet to cleaner or electric vehicles and promote the less-polluting Tier 3 fuel that is now available at many Utah gas stations. His administration would set a goal of reducing overall emissions by 25% during his four-year term, he said.\Getting older, dirtier cars off the road is critical in improving air quality in Utah, since they are major contributors to tailpipe emissions in the Salt Lake Valley, Winder Newton said. She also highlighted the need to explore alternative solutions for heating and cooling buildings, which are expected by 2024 to overtake vehicles as the Utah’s primary source of wintertime pollution.\Former GOP Chairman Thomas Wright said the state must invest in an efficient mass transit system and create walkable communities as a way of taking cars off the road. And Hughes said making sure growth isn’t confined to the Wasatch Front will help with emissions.\Democrat Zachary Moses is advocating for ending state investments in “dirty infrastructure,” while his primary rival, Peterson, said he wants to put the state on track to net-zero carbon emissions.\To that end, Peterson said he’d support tax incentives to encourage electric vehicle use, the development of wind and solar power plants in Utah and rooftop solar power investments by businesses, governments and residents.\While the Salt Lake City area has made strides in addressing its wintertime inversions, the region’s air quality is still ranked as some of the poorest in the nation. Dirty air has far-reaching effects, impacting public health, tourism and the broader economy, said Thom Carter, executive director of the Utah Clean Air Partnership.\That’s why it’s important that the state’s next governor has specific targets for purifying the Utah skies, he said. “We want someone who is willing to set goals, who wants to achieve those goals, who’s willing to lead by example.""\What happens to coal?\The candidates were all over the map on whether the state should pour funds into export terminals or other ways of transporting Utah’s coal to the international market. Cox, Burningham, Winder Newton and Hughes all expressed support for investments giving a strategic boost to the state’s coal industry.\Some even argued it would be good for the environment.\“Utah’s coal has less sulfur than coal from Australia and Indonesia. Lower sulfur, less emissions. Less emissions, cleaner air,” Hughes wrote in his response. “Coal exported from Utah will have a positive impact wherever it is used and will strengthen Utah’s economy.”\Similarly, Cox wrote that the more Utah coal is exported to other nations, “the healthier the environment will be across the globe.”\“When these markets transition to renewable energy sources, such as natural gas, Utah will be ready to meet these needs as well,” he added.\Brian Somers, president of the Utah Mining Association, wrote in an email that Utah’s next governor must fight for the ability to transport the state’s commodities overseas, even if it means challenging coastal cities that want to block export terminals.\“Extractive industries are the lifeblood of the economy in much of rural Utah,” Somers wrote. “They are among the largest private employers in many rural counties and pay family- and community-sustaining wages.”\But Moses was unequivocally against devoting state resources to help build an Oakland coal export terminal. Utah lawmakers have set aside upward of $53 million in public money for that terminal, estimated to cost $250 million, in an effort to shore up the coal industry, but that project has been bogged down in legal challenges and financial difficulties.\More ambiguous answers came from Huntsman and Wright, who said state government should carefully evaluate all spending and do all it can to diversify its economy. Huntsman said investing in a deep water terminal was an “audacious goal"" on the part of state lawmakers but warned that the “headwinds against coal are strong.”\“There has been little interest from investors in coal port infrastructure,” he wrote. “Capital is a coward and investors around the world are reading the signs that show growing concern over the environmental impacts of coal.”\And Peterson said state leaders should put money toward a clean energy future, explaining that he supports solar, wind and geothermal power projects “especially in those communities hardest hit by the decreasing competitiveness of our coal industry.”\Somers agrees that the next governor should support economic development across the state but says it “should be an exercise in addition, not subtraction.”\“Any candidate who claims that extractive industries in rural Utah can be replaced by tourism and telework is promoting a false narrative,” he wrote.\But Williams notes that 24 cities across Utah have pledged to use renewable energy by 2030.\“That tells you,"" he said, “that popular opinion is that people want to get off of coal.""\Crédito: By Bethany Rodgers"

SALT LAKE CITY - New public policy recommendations by the Utah Citizens' Counsel start and end with human rights, a member of the counsel and longtime member of the Utah State Board of Regents said Thursday.
\
""It is our belief that the strength of the Utah society depends upon fundamental fairness and equal opportunity for all of those in our increasingly diverse society and state,"" said Aileen Clyde, who is also a former counselor in the General Relief Society Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
\
Clyde noted that the group's 2015 Assessment of Public Policy Progress in Utah contains commendations but also recommendations to further the state's progress in seven key areas: health, public education, environment, interpersonal violence, poverty, participatory government and immigration.
\
""We believe that meeting the challenges that face us in Utah requires joint action by governments, nonprofits, religious groups, families and individuals. While valuing our tradition of self-reliance, we must work together to solve intractable problems,"" she said.
\
One of the group's recommendations is that the Utah attorney general should withdraw from the states' lawsuit that has prevented President Barack Obama's executive orders on Deferred Action for Parents of Americans from taking effect.
\
""UCC believes that the argument against the president's action is largely political,"" the report says.
\
On the other hand, the report commends Utah's driving privilege card legislation as well as the so-called Utah Dream Act, which extends in-state college tuition rates to qualified students who are not authorized to be in the United States.
\
The report has multiple recommendations calling for expansion of early childhood education.
\
""Providing at-risk children with opportunities to become kindergarten ready is one of the most important ways that Utah can prepare its children to succeed in school and life,"" the report says.
\
""To UCC, giving at-risk preschoolers an equal opportunity to learn is an important human right. Poverty and other at-risk environments damage educational opportunity.""
\
Clyde noted that many of the committees' reports dovetail, she noted, ""reflecting the relationship of one human right to another.""
\
For example, reducing poverty enhances educational opportunity, improves health and strengthens personal security.
\
Good health depends not only on medical care, but on clean air, clean water and social systems that encourage healthy habits.
\
""Human rights form a chain with many links,"" Clyde said.
\
Other recommendations:
\
* Combat climate change by the state imposing a carbon tax and significantly expanding incentives for solar and wind power.
\
* Phase out use of property taxes to subsidize the state's water supply.
\
* Fund full-day kindergarten for at-risk children.
\
* Take full advantage of Medicaid expansion and build the education, support services and regulation necessary for adequate, effective and fair care.
\
* Implement the provisions of the Prison Rape Elimination Act.
\
* Appropriate state funding for housing and services for 3,000 women, children and men turned away from overburdened crisis shelters, according to 2014 data.
\
* Appropriate new funding to ensure the five- and 10-year goals of the Intergenerational Welfare Reform Commission can be implemented.
\
* Create an independent redistricting process by statute or the initiative petition.
\
* Pass legislation that establishes campaign contribution limits.
\
Utah Citizens' Counsel is a ""nonpartisan group of senior community advocates dedicated to improving public policy in Utah,"" according to its website.
\
Clyde said the group's name is counsel as opposed to council. ""We're here to offer something, not be something,"" she explained.

Fervent. 1. Hot, burning, glowing, boiling. -- Oxford English Dictionary
\
WASHINGTON -- ""Fervently"" is how America will henceforth engage in talks on global warming. So said the president's climate change negotiator Sunday in Germany, at a U.N. conference on reducing carbon emissions. This vow was fervently applauded by conferees welcoming the end of what AP's news story called the Bush administration's ""eight years of obdurate participation"" in climate talks.
\
Reducing carbon emissions supposedly will reverse warming, if it resumes after the current period without warming, a period that began, according to statistics published by the World Meteorological Organization, 11 years ago. Regarding the reversing, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change has many ambitions, as outlined in a working group's 16-page ""information note"" to ""facilitate discussions."" For example:
\
""Tariffs can be lowered to grant special preference to climate-friendly goods, or they can be maintained at high levels to discourage trade in GHG (greenhouse gas)-intensive goods and services."" The working group says protectionism ""in the service of climate change objectives"" might virtuously ""shelter domestic producers of climate-friendly goods.""
\
Furthermore, using ""border carbon adjustment,"" a nation might virtuously ""impose costs on imports equivalent to that (sic) faced by domestic producers"" operating under a carbon tax. Or a nation with a cap-and-trade regime regulating carbon emissions by domestic manufacturers might require foreign manufacturers ""to buy offsets at the border equal to that (sic) which the producer would have been forced to purchase had the good been produced domestically.""
\
Cynics will see only potential for mischief by governments, including the U.S. government, using such measures to give a green patina to protectionism. Meanwhile, the U.S. government is having its own problems with one ""climate-friendly good"" that might not be. Last week The New York Times front page carried this headline: ""The Bulb That Saved the Planet May Be a Little Less Than Billed.""
\
The story recounted some Americans' misadventures with the new light bulbs that almost all Americans -- all but those who are filling their closets with supplies of today's incandescent bulbs -- will have to use after the phaseout of today's bulbs in 2014. (You missed that provision of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007?)
\
A San Francisco -- naturally -- couple emerged from Al Gore's movie ""An Inconvenient Truth"" incandescent with desire to think globally and act locally, in their home. So they replaced their incandescent bulbs with the compact fluorescents that Congress says must soon be ubiquitous. ""Instead of having a satisfying green moment, however,"" the Times reported, ""they wound up coping with a mess.""
\
Although supposed to last 10,000 hours and save, the Times says, ""as much as"" $5.40 a year in electricity costs, some bulbs died within a few hours. Some experts, reports the Times, ""blame the government for the quality problems,"" saying its push to cut the bulbs' prices prompted manufacturers to use inferior components.
\
Furthermore, some experts have written a guide saying the new bulbs require ""a little insight and planning."" The Times says that ""may be an understatement.""
\
The bulbs, says the Times, ""do not do well in hot places with little airflow, like recessed ceiling fixtures,"" and some do not work ""with dimmers or three-way sockets."" And: ""Be aware that compact fluorescents can take one to three minutes to reach full brightness. This is not a defect.""
\
Well, if you say so. Because all fluorescents contain mercury, a toxic metal, they must never be put in the trash, so Home Depot and other chains offer bins for disposing of dangerous bulbs. Driving to one of these disposal points might not entirely nullify the bulbs' environmental benefits. Besides, the Times summarizes the Environmental Protection Agency's helpful suggestions for coping with the environmental dangers caused when one of these environment-saving bulbs breaks:
\
""Clear people and pets from the room and open a window for at least 15 minutes if possible. Avoid vacuuming. Scoop up larger pieces with stiff paper or cardboard, pick up smaller residue with sticky tape, and wipe the area with a damp cloth. Put everything into a sealed plastic bag or sealed glass jar. In most cases, this can be put in the trash, but the EPA recommends checking local rules.""
\
Worrywarts wonder what will happen when a lazy or careless, say, 10 percent of 300 million Americans put their worn-out bulbs in the trash. Stop worrying. What do you think? That Congress, architect of the ethanol industry and designer of automobiles, does not think things through?

In 2012, ""The levels of gases in the atmosphere that drive global warming increased to a record high,"" according to BBC News.Greenhouse gases, global warming, melting glaciers, rising temperatures; these are all buzzwords you've probably heard (and then quickly dismissed) in the news. And of course you would dismiss them, because who can make sense of any of it? It's time somebody decoded the scientific jargon and explained why it all matters to you.
\
CO2, or carbon dioxide, is the most significant of the greenhouse gases that control the temperature of our atmosphere. Since the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s, CO2 emissions have been rising rapidly and causing negative effects on climate and other aspects of our Earth. Unfortunately, the situation has only worsened. In order to prevent severe and damaging warming of the Earth due to too much CO2 in the atmosphere, humans must change their ways -- and quickly. The path CO2 emissions follow in the next 15 years will determine the global climate for generations to come.
\
According to David Archer, author of ""Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast,"" ""emission reductions of at least 80 percent are needed by 2050."" CO2 emissions must be reduced by not only redesigning our energy usage, but by holding citizens of the world accountable for their negative contributions through a carbon tax.
\
It's easy to say what needs to be done for our planet, but when it's time to put a plan into action, the next move comes down to who will foot the bill. According to data collected in 2009 from David Archer's research, the three countries with the highest carbon release per dollar gross domestic product (GDP) were China, India and the United States. But the truth of the matter is that the entire world is to blame in one way or another, since there is no country or individual that doesn't emit CO2. It's time to stop playing the blame game and instead, spend the precious time we have left to save our planet mitigating the negative effects human actions have caused our environment.
\
All inhabitants of this planet inherit the same ecological responsibility. Utah's own Cache Valley has realized its responsibility in this endeavor and has taken steps toward cleaner air for all. According to Ordinance 2013-14, titled Implementation of a Vehicle Emissions and Maintenance Program in Cache County, all vehicles according to their model year are subject to either physical or visual emissions inspections to be conducted by private firms. A fee is assessed to all vehicle owners who wish to be registered in Cache County, which is then divided between the firm providing the inspection and the Bear River District Board of Health. This ordinance will improve the air quality in Cache Valley by ensuring all vehicles emit no more than the maximum emissions level. Cache Valley's actions should serve as a model for the rest of the United States.
\
I don't deny that a carbon tax wouldn't be a financial burden on Americans in these trying times, but it is crucial that the U.S. government implements this tax for households, businesses and utilities. Many Americans will object to the tax, but the truth is you cannot put a price on the health of Earth. According to an article from the Energy Collective, ""Should the U.S. Implement a Carbon Tax?"" recent legislations have arrived on a tax between $10 and $35 per metric ton (MT) of carbon.
\
For residents, this tax works out to be only $52 per year at $20/MT. We as Americans should focus on the good that the tax will do for our country and planet through subsidization of environmental programs and issuance of rebates. The cost is a small price to pay for cleaner air and a planet that will provide a stable atmosphere for generations to come, wouldn't you say?

125,"America urgently needs a ""green revolution,"" and it won't be painless, columnist and author Thomas Friedman told a sold-out crowd at Salt Lake City's Abravanel Hall on Tuesday night.\It needs to pioneer affordable clean energy not just to save the environment, the New York Times commentator said, but also to keep its competitive edge and to promote freedom around the world.\His prescription, in two words, to jump-start such a revolution: carbon tax.\""Price matters,"" Friedman told about 3,000 people at his keynote address in the Utah Museum of Natural History's 2009 ""Nature of Things"" lecture series. Last summer Toyota hybrids were in short supply, but now that gasoline prices have fallen, it's hard to sell one. The way to spur energy innovation by entrepreneurs in ""10,000 garages,"" Friedman said, is to make fossil fuels cost more.\If that means oil companies or American automakers as currently configured suffer, he said, then that's what must happen. Right now, those companies simply talk about being green, he said.\""Have you ever been to a revolution where nobody got hurt? Oh, that's the green revolution we're having,"" Friedman said. ""That's not a revolution, friends, that's a party.""\Addressing the theme of his new best-seller, Hot, Flat, and Crowded , the author said clean energy is in all the world's interest but will most reward the country that pioneers it. The booming global population will need energy to avoid poverty and, without a green revolution, that energy will foul the Earth on a calamitous scale.\Tackling the problem matters not just to the climate or to the rapid extinction of Earth's species, he said, but to freedom around the world. Friedman charted oil prices in recent decades and matched it against the rise and fall of freedom in petroleum-funded nations, or ""petrodictatorships,"" as measured by social scientists. The result is heightened freedom when oil is cheap, he said. For instance, Iranians elected a reformer at $16 a barrel and then a Holocaust denier at $75 a barrel.\If America does pay the real costs of carbon -- with a tax that considers everything from pollution to soldiers in Iraq -- it can scale up new energy technologies to the point at which they will be cheap enough to feed the population boom's energy hunger, Friedman said. He likened the process to the premium that Americans paid for the first cell phones, which in turn helped increase production until the prices fell.\His message resonated with the crowd, and many lined up for book signings afterward. Park City resident Jolene Aubel said she grew up in a Midwestern family with General Motors Corp. workers, but now wants a Toyota hybrid and would accept a carbon tax on her gas.\""It's something that's really important for people to hear right now,"" Aubel said. The fact that 3,000 Utahns bought tickets to hear it shows Americans are starting to take note.\bloomis@sltrib.com\Friedman on other topics\What Thomas Friedman told Utah reporters or Utah Museum of Natural History benefactors after a Tuesday luncheon:\On climate-change skeptics are science deniers - ""That's not conservative. That's crazy radical.""\On Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr.'s plan to boost natural-gas vehicles - It's good for a short-term reduction of carbon emissions, until even cleaner fuels are widespread. ""It's a very important bridge.""\On the stimulus package - It offers encouraging investments in renewable energy, but it won't tip the balance unless there's a carbon tax and a higher gas tax. ""If you don't have a price on carbon, none of this is going to happen.""\On President Obama's biggest early challenge - He has to save the banking system on which the rest of the economy depends.

126,"Gov. Gary Herbert’s proposal to increase the sales tax and to add a tax on services like haircuts and home repair raises revenue but hurts consumers and many small businesses.\However, a tax on carbon pollution could be a win-win for everyone. A carbon tax could generate revenue for the state while allowing a reduction in some other taxes and also help protect our environment by incentivizing a market-based solution to greenhouse gas emissions.\As a pioneering state, let’s take an innovative approach to raising revenue. A carbon tax will protect our economy, consumers, businesses and our environment.\Robert T. Peterson, South Jordan\Submit a letter to the editor\Credit: By Robert T. Peterson | The Public Forum"
127,"Salina -\Coal is key to Utah's economy for at least the next generation, Gov. Gary Herbert said on a tour of the state's top power sources Friday.\At least, he said, it is if industry can clean it up.\Without reduced carbon emissions, he warned miners at the massive underground Sufco Mine, national political realities may drive up coal's costs, suppressing Utah's prospects. But he said he is confident the state's universities and regulators have a role in enabling clean-energy industries, including cleaner uses of coal.\""Frankly, we've got to find cleaner ways to have affordable energy,"" Herbert said after riding 8 & #189; miles into the side of a mountain here, where Arch Coal is grinding 3,000 or more tons a day. Otherwise the federal government likely will impose carbon costs, through a tax or other method.\The Sufco mine supplies nearby power plants and is the origin of roughly half of all electricity used in Utah. Together, Utah's coal mines and some in Colorado and Wyoming provide more than 80 percent of the power used in the state. It's an arrangement that makes Utah's electricity some of lowest costing in the nation -- less than 6.7 cents per kilowatt hour, compared to about 14 cents in California. But environmental and health advocates say the cheap energy isn't worth the prices paid downwind.\Renewable energy, while growing, accounts for single-digit percentages in Utah's energy portfolio, and mostly feeds California and other higher-priced regional markets.\Friday's tour was an early attempt at gathering ideas to put Herbert's recently released 10-year state energy plan into practice. The plan calls for market-driven development of everything from natural gas-fired electricity to wood-based gas and solar fields.\Critics have said it's not really a plan, because as yet it offers no clear price changer -- tax preferences for renewables, for instance -- but Herbert is backing a university-based initiative for innovation. He also backs coal as the great cost-reducer, and on Friday told Arch Coal officials that if it's in the state's cost interests, ""then, by golly, we ought to be burning more coal, but we ought to be concerned about the environment, too.""\""Coal, certainly for the next generation, has a role to play,"" the governor said later in an interview.\Here in south central Utah, coal's role is bedrock. Sufco alone has 385 employees, mostly living in the dusty service centers of Salina and Richfield. Some 280 local truckers haul 800 loads to Utah power plants and a rail yard at Levan daily. On Friday, they wound constantly though the Interstate 70 ranch exit interchange that accesses the mine.\There are thousands of coal miners in Utah, including about 900 working for St. Louis-based Arch Coal's three mines here. They make, on average, about $75,000, or $112,000 if you add in benefits, the company's regional president, Gene DiClaudio, told the governor.\Sufco, mined since 1941, probably has another 20 years of life, DiClaudio said. As its easier deposits are removed, though, it will require more engineering and become more expensive.\Deep in the mountain, long-wall mining foreman Clayton Dalton was monitoring the 1,000-foot apparatus that strips and ships coal from the seam. Long-wall mining uses computer-driven carbide rotors that churn a few feet of coal from the wall on each pass. The coal falls onto a wet conveyor belt and is sprayed for dust suppression, and Dalton and his crew watch the equipment.\They work in a mechanized cocoon about 25 feet wide and 15 feet high that runs the length of the coal wall. Tree-trunk-sized hydraulic jacks support a steel roof over them, and steel flaps hanging near the wall protect them from spraying coal shards as the grinder moves past. As the whole assemblage digs deeper into the wall, the hollowed space behind the miner collapses, and the mountaintop sags a little.\The ground beneath the miners' rubber boots is a mucky, gray sludge in their helmet lamp beams. The temperature is in the low 60s year-round.\""It's exciting work,"" Dalton, a 31-year Sufco veteran, shouted over the machinery's buzz. ""It's kind of like being a frontiersman. Nobody's ever walked here before. It's like walking on the moon.""\More than that, he said, it's work that ""keeps the world going.""\""I think it's the most important thing there is.""\It's no surprise that Herbert was quick to visit coal producers after releasing his plan this spring, said Utah State University political scientist Michael Lyons. It's politically safe in a conservative state that likes resource jobs, he said.\""It's very clearly designed to demonstrate support for the development of coal,"" Lyons said. ""It's not at all surprising that the governor would indirectly be endorsing the more intense use of coal to meet the energy needs.""\Lyon is skeptical that any state energy policy can make significant shifts in a market that's driven by international demand, though. It may be that Utah will move away from coal because that international demand, coupled with environmental costs, drives up fossil fuel costs and spurs alternative technologies, he said.\Idaho State University political scientist Robert Forbis, whose doctoral dissertation at the University of Utah focused on Western energy and the environment, said direct and indirect subsidies are part of what's keeping fossil fuels relatively cheap. If Congress would remove oil and gas development subsidies, he said, or impose a carbon tax or some system of capturing environmental costs, renewables would develop faster.\That's a tough sell when coal and oil companies have great political influence.\""These are powerful political lobbies,"" he said. ""They contribute heavily to both Republicans and Democrats.""\Herbert acknowledged ""soft costs"" of coal use, but said they're hard to quantify and don't justify a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system. Such measures just stifle innovation, he said.\Terry Marasco, of the Utah Clean Air Alliance, said his group submitted numerous health studies to the governor's planning team, but the plan did not reference their data on coal's health costs.\""Coal being the worst polluter, [that] tells the citizens that the government is more concerned about revenue than health issues,"" Marasco said.\Herbert also toured Rocky Mountain Power's Huntington coal-fired power plant, a customer for Sufco coal. The steam turbines there provided enough power for 666,000 homes last year, company officials told him.\After the tour, plant safety manager David Verdi said workers there face risks from pressurized systems, just like miners risk cave-ins, but he isn't sure customers fully appreciate it.\""Most of us just go into our office, turn on the lights, grind our coffee, think everything's OK,"" he said. ""I think we take it for granted.""\Is coal the state's future?\Credit: By Brandon Loomis The Salt Lake Tribune"
128,"As the world approaches a tipping point in the climate change crisis, many people finally appear to be waking up to the need for radical change, although the Trump administration is still pushing in the opposite direction.\Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, urged world leaders to come to New York with action plans, not fancy speeches, to deal with climate change. Before the U.N. Climate Action Summit, which began Monday, students around the world went on strike and scientists gathered to warn that climate change is hitting harder and sooner than they had originally predicted.\Dealing with climate change will require an ethical vision, solid science and good economic policies. The absence of any of these three could consign our response to failure.\The ethical vision is needed because any adequate response will require sacrifice, and people do not make sacrifices without motivation. Too many people alive today do not see the need for sacrificing their comfort to reduce climate change. Most will be dead before the worst happens. In addition, the worst impact will be on the poor, not the wealthy, whose money can mitigate the consequences of global warming.\Responding to climate change requires a moral vision that puts the poor and future generations on an equal footing with ourselves. A libertarian vision in which each person seeks his own advantage will not work. Common effort and common sacrifice for the common good are what is required.\Pope Francis said in his video message to the climate summit, “The problem of climate change is related to issues of ethics, equity and social justice.”\“With honesty, responsibility and courage, we have to put our intelligence at the service of another type of progress,” said the pope, “one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral, capable of placing economy at the service of the human person, building peace and protecting the environment.”\It was this moral sense that Greta Thunberg, the leader of the worldwide student strike, represented when she told the gathered leaders at the U.N., “If you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil, and that I refuse to believe.”\But the climate crisis will require not only an ethical vision but also a religious one. Throughout human history, religion has motivated people to do extraordinary things, sometimes bad but also good. The cathedrals of Europe were begun and mostly built by people who never saw their completion. How do you motivate someone to take the first shovel of dirt for a building that will not be completed for centuries?\Pope Francis, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of the Orthodox Christian Church, the Dalai Lama and many other religious leaders are attempting to lead their followers with a religious vision that is committed to taking on climate change. If the Earth is God’s creation, then abusing it is an offense against God.\If the Earth is an icon where we can see the face of God, then defacing it is a sacrilege. If we are all God’s children, then we must protect one another from harm. If you contribute to global warming, then you may be consigned to the fires of hell.\But an ethical and religious vision is insufficient without solid science. Science tells us what is causing global warming: CO2 and other greenhouse gases caused by human activity. Science tells us what the impact of global warming will be: melting ice caps and rising sea levels; melting glaciers and disruption of weather patterns and water supplies; disruption of agriculture; and extermination of millions of species of animals, plants and insects.\According to the latest report on climate change compiled by the U.N. World Meteorological Organization, “Widespread and long-lasting heat waves, record-breaking fires and other devastating events such as tropical cyclones, floods and drought have had major impacts on socioeconomic development and the environment.”\The WMO report “highlights the urgency of fundamental socio-economic transformations and carbon-curbing actions in key sectors such as land use and energy to avert dangerous global temperature increase, with potentially irreversible impacts.”\Science not only shows us how bad things are, it can also show us ways to reverse these trends. Changing how we travel, how we farm and what we consume can make a difference. Scientific research can also find new solutions that we have not even thought of.\But ethics and science will not be enough if the world’s economy is going in the wrong direction. We need good economic policies.\Tax and regulatory policies still subsidize the carbon-based economy. The oil, gas and coal lobbies fight to protect these subsidies that encourage the consumption of fossil fuels. Economists, on the other hand, tell us the best way to slow global warming is to put a tax on carbon. This would send a signal throughout the economy that it is in our financial interest to reduce our consumption of fossil fuels.\Gilbert Metcalf of the Brookings Institution argues that a well-designed carbon tax can actually boost jobs and gross domestic product, while reducing carbon emissions. He prefers a carbon tax to the more complicated and less effective “cap and trade” mechanisms espoused by those who are allergic to the word “tax.”\An initial rate of, say, $40 a ton of carbon dioxide emissions would provide price incentives for both consumers and businesses to reduce carbon consumption and invest in energy efficiency and clean sources of energy.\GM is closing plants that produce more efficient cars because with gas prices low, consumers prefer SUVs and trucks. If these plants had stayed open it might not have been hit by strikes.\An ethical vision, solid science and good economic policies are necessary if we are to save future generations and our planet from devastation. There is no time to spare.\The views expressed in this opinion piece do not necessarily reflect those of Religion News Service.\Crédito: By Thomas Reese Religion News Service"

The soft-spoken, gentle man invited me to remove my shoes, don a white cap and wash my hands before eating lunch. His tight turban and long uncut beard unmistakably identified him as one the Sikhs who offered a free lunch daily to all the 9,800 attendees at the Parliament of the World's Religions. Their generosity and caring was typical of the attendees of the Parliament.
\
The Parliament attracted people representing 50 different faiths and 80 countries to Salt Lake City on Oct. 15-19. Despite their diversity, they were united over the issues of poverty, women's rights, violence and climate change. I was one of six Citizens' Climate Lobby members who gave three presentations on the challenges of climate change.
\
As we learned at the Parliament, people of faith throughout the world are speaking up on this issue of climate change primarily on moral grounds. Those who have done the least to cause global warming - the poor, children and the unborn - will be affected the most.
\
Virtually every religion has a statement on the need to address climate change and/or to be good stewards of the earth. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Newsroom section Environmental Stewardship and Conservation quotes President Russell M. Nelson: ""We should care for the earth and preserve it for future generations."" In his encyclical Pope Francis admonished, ""Humanity is called to recognize the need for changes of lifestyle, production and consumption, in order to combat this warming.""
\
Last week the American Academy of Pediatrics released the official statement ""Global Climate Change and Children's Health."" It states, ""Climate change poses threats to human health, safety, and security, and children are uniquely vulnerable to these threats."" The statement outlines the many ways in which climate change threatens children's health, from intolerable heat to extreme weather events. They call for action at all levels of society.
\
Fortunately a broad consensus is beginning to emerge that pricing carbon is the most equitable, transparent and effective way to speed the transition off of greenhouse gas-producing fossil fuels and on to clean energy. Currently 40 countries and jurisdictions are pricing or considering pricing carbon. Even Gov. Gary Herbert recently stated, ""A carbon tax certainly has been talked about; I don't know if I'm quite with a carbon tax yet, but I certainly think it can be reviewed.""
\
The nonpartisan Citizens' Climate Lobby advocates that a fee be placed on carbon at the source-mine, well or port of entry - and all the proceeds returned to Americans. A gradual and predictable rise in the fee would spur innovation and allow time to adapt. Compared with no carbon fee, such a policy would create jobs, stimulate the economy and reduce deaths from air pollution.
\
And now congressional Republicans are beginning to consider policy to address climate change, including a fee on carbon. On Sept. 15, Rep. Chris Gibson, R-N.Y., introduced House Resolution 424, expressing a ""commitment of the House of Representatives to conservative environmental stewardship,"" including finding solutions to climate change. There are 10 Republican co-sponsors to this resolution. And a few days ago Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., announced the formation of the Senate Energy and Environment Working Group, made up of four Republican senators.
\
There are moral, economic and health reasons to mitigate the most severe effects of climate change. Will our Utah senators and representatives join the growing ranks of members of Congress who acknowledge this? Reps. Rob Bishop, Chris Stewart, Jason Chaffetz and Mia Love can co-sponsor the Gibson resolution and Sens. Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee can join Ayotte's group. If they hear from citizens that this is important, they might actually do it.

130,"We appreciate so many things at Thanksgiving, it's fitting that we express gratitude for the abundance that fossil fuel energy has provided. Modern civilization with our lengthened life spans, comfortable homes, wondrous technology and so much more has come about because of the power of coal, oil and natural gas.\But there is a dark underbelly to this abundance. And it is not just our sickening and deadly winter inversions (See ""New Research: Bad air can literally cause a heart attack,"" Tribune, Nov. 8), the 1,400 Utah coal miners who have died extracting coal for our use (See ""Price dedicates memorial to miners killed in county's coal mines, Tribune Sept. 7), or oil spills such as the ones that contaminated Red Butte Creek and devastated the Gulf of Mexico. Invisible greenhouse gases that humans are pumping into our atmosphere as we burn fossil fuels create the most insidious and damaging dark side. These gases are dangerously warming our planet and threatening our Utah ski industry, water supplies, and forests.\Not only are these gases damaging our planet, they are damaging our health, especially that of our children. Recently the American Academy of Pediatrics released an official statement, ""Global Climate Change and Children's Health."" They state, ""Climate change poses threats to human health, safety, and security, and children are uniquely vulnerable to these threats."" The statement outlines the many ways in which climate change threatens children's health, from intolerable heat to extreme weather events.

The LDS Newsroom website Environmental Stewardship and Conservation quotes Apostle Russell M. Nelson, ""We should care for the earth and preserve it for future generations."" When Pope Francis was at the White House in September, he admonished, ""Climate change is a problem that can no longer be left to future generations.""\As the United Nations prepares for the COP21 summit in Paris starting Nov. 30, consensus is beginning to emerge that pricing carbon is the most equitable, transparent and effective way to speed the transition from fossil fuels to abundant, everlasting clean energy. Currently 40 countries and jurisdictions are pricing or considering pricing carbon. Even Gov. Gary Herbert recently stated, ""A carbon tax certainly has been talked about; I don't know if I'm quite with a carbon tax yet, but I certainly think it can be reviewed.""\The non-partisan Citizens' Climate Lobby advocates placing a fee on carbon fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) at the source, and returning all of the proceeds to the American public. As George Shultz , former secretary of the treasury and secretary of state under Ronald Reagan, explains, because the money is returned to households and not used for government programs, is it a ""fee"" and not a tax. A carbon fee/dividend policy actually creates an opportunity, as it will spur innovation, strengthen the economy, and create jobs, while decreasing deaths from air pollution.\And now congressional Republicans are beginning to consider climate change actions, including a fee on carbon.

131,"Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman is back in the state after serving for two years as U.S. ambassador to Russia. But not only is Huntsman back home, he’s also running for his old job, announcing his gubernatorial campaign Thursday.\Earlier this week on the ‘Trib Talk’ podcast, Huntsman sat down with Tribune reporters Benjamin Wood and Bethany Rodgers to discuss his candidacy, and his position on a range of issues affecting Utah. The conversation was embargoed until he made his formal announcement.\A transcript of the conversation, edited for clarity and length, is included below. For the full interview, search for “Trib Talk” on SoundCloud, iTunes and Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Stitcher, Spotify and other major podcast platforms.\Benjamin Wood: Ambassador Jon Huntsman, thank you for joining us today. I’m Benjamin Wood from the Tribune and also with me is Bethany Rogers. To start off today, you’ve recently returned from Russia, which is in the center of all sorts of things happening right now. You’ve spoken to our colleagues in the Utah media about your concerns on the impeachment process. I believe you told the DNews that you’re worried about the rush to impeachment. Has your thinking changed at all or evolved at all as more information has come forward?\Jon Huntsman: No. First of all, I’m troubled, very troubled by the information that has come out with respect to a possible quid pro quo, particularly the work done by [Rudy] Giuliani. I don’t think that has any place in our foreign policy, particularly when you’re subcontracting out those kinds of communications that otherwise ought to be handled on a government to government basis.\We need to hear more. We need folks to come forward with information. We have a whistleblower. We have a statute that protects whistleblowers, that should be respected. We should collect the information, as we always do, in a transparent fashion. We should let the American people look and analyze that information and see where it leads us. But we’re just, I think, in the front end of a lot of this right now.\When I say rush to impeachment, what I would not want to see happen is for the impeachment process to become politicized. Now, when is it not? I mean, we’ve only had four of them in the history of our country. But my fear is that with an election, a national election less than a year away, why not let the people be the final arbiters, the final decision-makers on what they think, once all the information is brought forward?\I think that leaves us in a much better, sturdier position as a country with already a weakened political system because of the hyper polarity. That leaves us in a better place than an impeachment process that ultimately is going to veer toward politics. And people are going to see that. And so I think it just leaves us in a really bad place. If we didn’t have election a year out, maybe the answer would be different. But that’s kind of how I see it.\Benjamin Wood: You started with your concerns about the potential quid pro quo. If that were to be established in fact — that there was a this-for-that agreement, pressure placed on a foreign country asking for political aid — if that were to be established, would that rise to the level of impeachment in your mind?\Jon Huntsman: Well, time will answer that one. I think it’s too early to tell.\Benjamin Wood: And I’m not asking if you think that happened. But I’m saying if that were to have happened, would that be in the class of conversation [for impeachable crimes]?\Jon Huntsman: It depends what the totality of the action was. Was it a conversation and nothing more? Was it tied to the transfer of funds or ultimately military assets that actually were held up or not? We don’t know. At least I don’t know the answers to all of that.\So this is a complicated issue dealing with a complicated country with a newly elected president in a highly volatile part of the world, one where the United States has had an on-again-off-again relationship in recent years. And so there’s a lot that the American people are going to have to look at here, including not just the conversation, but the follow on actions, if there were, in fact, actions that took place. The totality of it.\Benjamin Wood: What do you make of the approach that our state’s federal delegation has taken on this topic? We see a range from Mitt Romney, who has expressed some criticisms, to Chris Stewart, who is a vocal supporter and defender of the president. What do you make of the way that our elected leaders are approaching this subject?\Jon Huntsman: Oh, I think they’re all approaching it in their own way, based upon their temperament, their approach to the administration, their relationship with President Trump. I think there are a lot of variables at play that put people where they are in this particular issue.\And that’s not surprising, because anytime you have something like this, you look back at a recent impeachment trials, whether it was Bill Clinton or whether it was Richard Nixon, our two most recent, and you’re going to find people who take different positions based on different motivations.\But there’s a lot yet to come. And I think the call for transparency, the call for all of the facts is probably the best thing that we can be doing right now in terms of what best serves our national interest.\Benjamin Wood: Our intelligence community has put forth that Russia engaged in an intentional and active campaign of meddling in the 2016 election. Do you see any reason to be skeptical of that conclusion and what do you think it means for 2020?\Jon Huntsman: I do believe they meddled. One of the first things I did when I got my security clearances, as I’ve had done a few times in my career, is to read the comprehensive report done by the intelligence community. Now, in this case, the intelligence community, the DNI, the director of national intelligence has about 17 or 18 component parts. Some of them are high profile and well-known to people like the FBI, the CIA, the National Security Agency. But then there are some smaller players.\It’s rare that they come forward with a consensus point of view. In this case, they came forward with a consensus point of view. So I say, OK, that means something to me. If you got the entire IC, intelligence community, that is saying the same thing, basically.\And so I sorted through the information and it was pretty clear to me that things took place that were aimed at taking us down, at weakening people and our political system. It’s also clear to me that this isn’t the first time they have done that. You can go back to the election of 1976 when Brezhnev supported Gerry Ford, because Gerry Ford was in favor of continuing an arms control negotiation, something that Russia, the Soviet Union then, saw as being in the national interest.\And maybe even before that. You go back 100 years ago to the fall of the Tsarist period and the rise of the communist period after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 and disinformation and spinning the truth and propaganda and malign activities in their particular neighborhood. None of this is new. This is a tool box that has existed for some time. And it’s a tool box that is only strengthening with technology that allows — whether the troll farms in St. Petersburg or whether their ability through the GRU, the intelligence arm of their military — to be very specific in identifying targets through cyber means and taking them down through disinformation, through propaganda and other malign efforts.\It’s not going to stop. They’re going to continue. Why? Because they want to see our country weakened. They want to exacerbate the extremes of our political divide. So when we have an incident based on race, a mass shooting, for example, some of the trolls that you see pop up and some of the Facebook messaging is not always from U.S. players. In some cases, they are from foreign players who are mimicking American citizens and trying to play into the extremes of our debates just to divide us further.\It’s a feature that has been a prominent part of their malign toolbox in recent years, and it ain’t going away. This will continue and will continue into the 2020 election.\My concerns are that the efforts could start playing out at a local election level. Imagine local elections where voter registration banks were tampered with, election results were changed, where on voter registration day, times of signing up or places where you could sign up was all of a sudden changed.\There are lots of ways to sort of trip up our process of democracy, and it all starts at the grassroots level, with getting people registered to vote [and] informed about the candidates. And these are all areas of real vulnerability for us.\Benjamin Wood: As you mentioned several times, we’re heading toward the next presidential election, that brings with it a lot of questions about security, about some of these topics. It also brings up the question of our current Republican president running for reelection. Do you have any take on whether or not you would support his reelection or endorse, or do you have any thoughts on his presidency yet to date?\Jon Huntsman: Well, he’s kept us out of war, where many upon his election or even in the run up to his election said that he would bring catastrophe after catastrophe on the world stage. I see a lot of disorder, but disorder is always a part of our global engagement and the way in which the world is transitioning, particularly following the Jasmine revolutions of 2007, 2008.\And he’s kept the economy strong, which I think a lot of voters are going to look at. So I think those are the two big things that people are going to really evaluate his presidency on.\He’s blustery, he’s bombastic, he’s outspoken. He tweets in ways that make a lot of people uncomfortable, including me. But in the end, I think they’re going to say, are we at war? OK. He’s trying to clean up the Middle East from a 20 year ongoing series of wars. That’s a good thing.\And the economy is doing better than a lot of people thought, particularly as it relates to minority populations that are seeing higher rates of job creation and job growth than we have since the 1960s.\So I think these all play to the benefit of Trump in a reelection and he’ll have to get through whatever the process is by the House of Representatives based on the approach to impeachment. And that may or may not trip him up. Hard to know. But in the case of Bill Clinton, after his [impeachment] was overturned in the Senate, it only strengthened the hands of his own party. And Newt Gingrich, who was the speaker of the House of Representatives, will tell you that chapter and verse. So you have to approach the impeachment process during an election year, I think, very carefully.\Benjamin Wood: We’d like to pivot to more local issues but before we do, anything we haven’t talked about on the federal, national level of anything you care to follow up on before we transition?\Jon Huntsman: It’s a complicated and confusing world right now. The thing I walked away from most as I did from China, when I saw President Obama, is there’s still only one superpower in the world.\There are a couple of great powers and among them are China and Russia. But there’s only one superpower. And we are so dramatically ahead in terms of the areas that really matter in terms of national power, whether that is our economic performance, whether it’s our national defense, whether it’s our ability to create and sustain a self-sustaining civil society. I hope that lasts. That’s the most important thing that we have. And our soft power, which no other country even comes close to. Our ability to write the lyrics that everybody sings and reads around the world. Still, these are very prominent features of our national power. And I just don’t see another rival emerging on the world stage with the exception of China. And they’ve got their own challenges around the bend.\Bethany Rodgers: I guess the one follow up question that I would have before we transition is, what was your sense of the international sentiment toward the U.S. and toward President Trump? Did it change over the time that you were abroad?\Jon Huntsman: Well, I’ve seen the sentiment ebb and flow. I saw the sentiment when I worked for George W. Bush, who was widely reviled by Europe for his declarations of war in the Middle East. We were probably trading at an all time low in terms of our reputation and respect, mostly among our European partners and allies and friends who really should have stepped up and done more.\So I saw that as a low point. I see today still some concerns about the uncertainty surrounding U.S. policy. And in some areas, the president has hit Europe hard on things like living up to 2 percent of their GDP spent on national defense, which is really one of the goals of NATO membership among the 29 NATO countries.\I think that has created some some concern because there’s been lip service that’s been paid for decades now around that. And the president’s really tried to push some of the members on that. So there’s a little bit of backlash as far as that goes.\The trade war with China, I mean, where even to start on that. He’s taken on some issues that the past two or three presidents could have taken on, easily, but didn’t because of the political difficulty in calling the Chinese out on things like intellectual property theft and basic market access issues and indigenous innovation issues, picking winners, which they’re doing at the expense of U.S. competition within the marketplace.\So the world’s a complicated place and in the end, there is still enormous respect for the U.S. system, which transcends any one politician. And that’s our civil society, our values — that still really are sought after in a big part of the world, although you don’t hear about that a lot — and still our willingness to expend national resources to protect those who are being bullied abroad.\These things are still respected and the U.S. is still very much a leader in that regard.\Benjamin Wood: Let’s talk about Utah. We appreciate your time and we appreciate your willingness to chat with us on an embargoed basis. Listeners, just so you’re aware, we’re speaking on Monday and this episode likely will not be released for a few days. I can’t say for sure exactly when you’re hearing it.\There had been rumors swirling for the last several weeks about first, your return to the state in general and then, secondly, the potential for another run for governor.\There’s been this question out there among people who wonder why, who, for lack of a better phrase, think that Utah might be small potatoes for a man of your international and national reputation. And I think that’s kind of the first question we had, is why after after being ambassador, after running for president, after everything you’ve done, including being the governor of the state of Utah, why run again for governor?\Jon Huntsman: Well, first of all, this has always been our home. And so, of course, we’re going to return to where we have a home and have always been residents and will be for generations.\If you have a love for the state, as I do, as my family does, and if you want to see it survive the challenges of the future, and if there is an open seat in 2020, which there is, and if you feel that you helped to get the state in part to where it is today in areas around economic development, education, the environment and other areas, then you have to conclude — I have to conclude by saying we’re not done.\I think this state is just getting going. I really do. And if you have some ideas about where things could be improved and you’re not willing to put your voice forward, then I say, as someone who has been committed to public service a good part of my life, that I would be a lesser person for not wanting to stand up and do something about it.\Why governor? Because it’s the best job in the world. And I know that because I’ve done it. It’s a job that’s given to you by the people. And they put great faith and trust in you as governor. They afford you great leeway to do things. They want to know that you’re out looking out for the future, looking around the bend, anticipating risk and looking out for the next generation of Utahns, kids and grandkids. And you feel that when you’re governor.\It’s an awesome, awesome place to be. And in the public service experiences I’ve had — and again, they’ve been international and they’ve been here domestically — there hasn’t been an honor as great as serving the people of Utah.\Benjamin Wood: Well, you touched on a lot of topics there, some that we do want to return back to. But just to kind of set this up, we’d like to cover a wide range of things and we’ll be going back and forth a little bit. I’ll essentially get out of Bethany’s way for a minute and we’ll just see what we can cover in the time that we have.\Bethany Rodgers: To follow up on what you just said. I’m wondering if you feel like you have, I guess, the pulse of Utah having been away for a bit. Do you feel like you have your arms around what’s going on in the state at this point?\Jon Huntsman: You never leave. You read every day. You stay in contact? You return. But if you’re as invested as we were as governor before [we were] called off to go to China, you never leave those issues, they stay with you.\And maybe not too surprising. The issues are still with us today. I look at the headline issues and a lot of them are still based upon the issues that we focused on and tried to find solutions for and in some cases found some pretty good solutions and maybe a bit of updating is required. But no, you never lose your connectivity with the great state of Utah.\Benjamin Wood: Do you intend to gather signatures under SB54?\Jon Huntsman: Yes, we do.\Benjamin Wood: And what do you make of that whole discussion? It’s been a lingering debate for several years. What do you make of the transition and the new way that we’re nominating people for their party primary?\Jon Huntsman: Well, it’s run its course. It’s gone through the court system. It’s been debated for some time. I think you still need to pay respects to those who participate at the caucus levels, who turn out and run for state delegate.\I’ve been to countless of those cottage meetings where people run to be a state delegate and then they gather at the state convention. I think that’s still an important part of the process. And we would fully intend as a candidate to be part of that process, to visit as many delegates as we can. Just like we did last time. I’ve been through it twice.\The signature gathering is something that obviously is new. And I think all candidates are going to do that. It would probably be malpractice from an insurance standpoint not to do that. But that isn’t saying that you give short shrift to delegates and people who work the grassroots level. That’s the heart and soul of either one of the parties.\Bethany Rodgers: I wanted to ask you about the ongoing tax reform effort and the state considering a lot of options for rebalancing revenue streams. One of the things that’s currently on the table, as you know, is taxing food at the full sales tax level. Knowing that you tried to bring down the sales tax on food, what is your perspective of this effort and in particular, the food tax?\Jon Huntsman: Well, we not only tried to take it down, we did. And I think that was a very good thing. And there’s an economic argument. But there’s also a moral argument to be made that I think compels me and that compelled a lot of legislators at the time.\We took an old, more antiquated, system, which was a more progressive taxation system that had six tiers to it and probably a high rate of 7 percent. But when fully loaded, probably closer to 10. And I was compelled to move toward a flatter tax for purposes of competitiveness.\So as I went around, you know, doing the diligence before I ran in ’04 and then after I was elected, talking to people, what is most important for the state in terms of maintaining our competitiveness, given the levers that you really control. And the things that took us in that direction were, for example, the outflow of brainpower.\Why do we raise and educate kids here, the best and brightest, and they go somewhere else to make their dreams come true? That, to me, was not right. And we needed more of an environment that kept people here, which is to say more opportunity. Well, more opportunity usually comes in the form of more jobs and economic pursuits. In order to get that, you had to bring in more investment. In order to get more investment, you had to have a more attractive environment.\So for me, the 10-point plan that we created in ’04 was exactly to address our competitive needs. Because if we did that right, then education would benefit, transportation would benefit and families would benefit because people would have more choices to stay here as opposed to fleeing to Maricopa County or Clark County or Denver, which a lot we’re doing.\And it’s like, OK, so we raise them, we pay for their education, they say goodbye to their families. That’s just not right. We need to keep them here.\So we did in the old tax system, this was ’06 and ’07, started with a special session and then went beyond. And it was our first flat tax of its kind in the country. And people at the beginning said, ‘no way you get it done.’ And we said, ‘well, with the right kind of coalition, we can get it done.’ And we did.\And as part of that overall effort, we took the rate down to just slightly below 5 percent and did a little bit of work on the sales tax, particularly the sales tax coming off of food, which I thought was a really important thing to do. And I still believe that it’s an important thing to do.\It means a lot to families who in many cases can barely get by. And there’s nothing more basic than food for families. So I think that’s something that needs to stay where it is going forward. And I do believe that we have a tax structure that when you stack it up to other states is probably in the top 10, 15 states in terms of best practices. Sales tax, no, I think that’s one area where we lack and that’s going to need some work.\Income tax, it’s a best practices state. Business tax, it’s best practices. Property tax, it’s OK. And I’m referring to Tax Foundation analysis of all the 50 states. Sales tax is going to need, I think, a little bit of work. And therein lies the challenge.\So how do you broaden a base that used to be a whole lot more, consumer driven, consumer purchases of goods, and now it’s more and more services, maybe, I don’t know, 65 percent where it was maybe 50 percent in earlier years. How do you deal with that diminution of revenue? How do you make up for it in a way that is fair, by broadening the base? Any tax policy wants to begin by broadening a base and then applying a rate to that base. It’s hard to rely on a base that continues to shrink. And you have to say, why is it shrinking and what can be done in order to broaden that base and to make sure that all the bills are paid for.\So that takes us to a tax reform today. And I’m not quite sure where it’s going, but something will have to be done as it relates to the sales tax generally. But it has to be done in a way that really takes into account small businesses, which are the majority of job creators in the state. Some of them who can ill afford more bureaucratic efforts and higher costs.\So I would love it if we could still move toward a postage stamp [tax return]. You know just an envelope, if you will, size tax return. I think that still should be our goal. And it was our goal back when we started tax reform, which was the last time taxes really were tackled in the state.\There’s still some updating and maintaining that we can do in this drive for an ever more competitive state, because if we sleep on all those around us in our neighborhood, you better believe they’re sharpening their knives and trying to figure out how they can steal jobs from us and investment and become better at the economic development game.\Benjamin Wood: What do you make then of the proposal to amend the Constitution and do away with the income tax earmark so that can be spent on things that aren’t public education?\Jon Huntsman: I don’t have a position on that right now. I think first and foremost, as we look at the budget as I used to look at the budget, it was usually what do we do about public ed? That’s always thought No. 1. Now it’s a big percentage of our $18, $19 billion budget.\I think it’s probably time that we look more creatively at how we fund education. I think coming from the [Education] fund, as it has been, as earmarked by the Constitution, is important. But are there things additive that we can do for public education that we haven’t thought of before?\I’m not against looking for new revenue streams that will bring additional support to education. But when we talk about support for education, the [weighted pupil unit] that drives funding for students is one thing. Compensation for teachers is another that really is of interest to me.\I don’t know if you were reporting back in the days when we tried to get the highest level of compensation to teachers as part of our overall tax reform package earlier on. And we did that for a reason. I believe that we ought to get the best and the brightest in education. And part of it is when somebody is born to be an educator, as my grandfather was, no place will make them happy outside the classroom. I mean, they’re just born to do that. So that’s one part of it.\People want to be educators and we’re grateful for that. But there is a compensation part of it, too. They ought to be compensated fairly and we ought to have the compensation such that it does attract people who might drift off into some other line of work because we need the best and the brightest in the classroom for the next generation of Utahns.\Bethany Rodgers: Another piece of the tax reform discussion has been about transportation funding, about how the gas tax isn’t fully keeping up with the needs for infrastructure in the state. The task force right now is thinking about applying that sales tax to gas purchases. They’ve also discussed some sort of vehicle miles traveled initiative. And they’ve talked about the feasibility of toll roads.\All of those things have been kind of ideas floating out there. Do you have a position at this point on anywhere else to go for transportation funding?\Jon Huntsman: Same stuff that we’ve been talking about for a long time. Same thing. Just like on education. You know, a lot of this doesn’t change.\One thing I do know, if we get behind on transportation in terms of growth, we’re never going to catch up. You become a Maricopa County. You remember when Phoenix built their rail system, their light rail system when they had reached, I don’t know, maybe 5 million in size. They had just overtaken Philadelphia as the fifth largest city in the country. And the disruption and cost associated with doing something late in the game as opposed to ahead of time was hurtful, I think, to their overall economy and mobility.\So transportation is something that we have to stay on the cutting edge of. We can never fall behind the growth curve as it relates to transportation, which means all options have to be on the table. I’m not wedded to upping the gas tax. I don’t think that I’m ready to say anything on that front yet.\But I do think we need to look at all options for getting people around. And that includes walking, running, bikes, scooters, all forms of transportation. It includes ride-sharing that some cities and urban areas are looking at. So there are a lot of things that we can do that we ought to be looking at. But first and foremost, we can’t fall behind the growth curve as it relates to transportation.\Benjamin Wood: Should Utah host another Olympics?\Jon Huntsman: I think it’s worth considering. I wasn’t a huge proponent of the last one, just with concerns about what it might do to the canyons, from an environmental degradation standpoint. I was also a little concerned about creating jobs that were really temporary.\I was hard pressed to find any location that had hosted the Winter Olympics that actually benefited from a job creation standpoint. The jobs come and then they go, so how do you make it a sustainable effort? Moreover, most places outside of the United States and even some in the United States are able to pay for their Olympic costs and expenditures through government coffers, through travel and tourism budgets, stuff like that. We don’t do that.\So I think we have to be mindful of the budget, the economics, the environmental degradation and what you do with the infrastructure once it’s up and running.\I remember shortly after my election, I got the balance sheet on the infrastructure that we had built in ’02 and those were just a couple of years later. You get a luge run and, you know, slalom stuff and the giant ski jump facility. We have to maintain that, it has got to be maintained. Well, it costs money and you don’t have a whole lot of users for that.\So then you have to make a business model out of what you have. You bring in the professional sports organizations, you weave it into a travel tourism kind of design. So those are just right off the top of my head, you know, some concerns. Now, the positives are huge. And that is there are a few things in the world like the 14 or 15 day platform that you get in terms of projecting your community, your state, your culture to the rest of the world.\It’s a big deal. And I think we’ve benefited from that when we had the Olympics last time. So I think it’s an important conversation for people to have. And I would be neutral to positive about having it again.\Bethany Rodgers: Do you believe that human activity is a significant factor in a changing climate?\Jon Huntsman: I do believe that we are having an effect on the climate patterns, human activity in all of its forms and I think that’s been established by science. The question then becomes, well, what do you do about it and how can you address things like air quality and issues that become as much health related as they are pertinent to the environment?\And that’s where I think we find ourselves now in the Wasatch Front. I was down meeting with some entrepreneurs just recently in Lehi, a lot of the tech entrepreneurs. That’s an issue for them now in Utah Valley. So when they bring people to try to recruit talent, there are some months during the year that you just don’t want to do that. So that becomes an issue that we have to really think carefully about. It’s a health issue. It’s an environmental issue. And we have to be mindful, always, that we’re downstream, always downstream.\So we can do so much and then stuff blows our way, even from the factories of China and India. It gets in the jetstream. I’m talking more about pollutants, particulate matter, PM 2.5 stuff as opposed to the climate concerns, that ends up on the doorstep of California and then ultimately into the Wasatch Front. So this is a global issue, truly.\Benjamin Wood: I want to ask you about Medicaid and marijuana. We had two initiatives where the voters approved a particular approach. The Legislature repealed those approaches, put in their own plans and then those legislative plans suffered some defeats. And we’ve landed somewhere in the middle on both topics.\I’m curious what you think of where Utah is now on Medicaid and marijuana, and your thoughts on the Legislature repealing something that’s been approved by a majority vote?\Jon Huntsman: On the Medicaid front, we have to figure out how to cover families that are caught in between. And that was something we tried very hard to do the last go around by getting affordable, accessible, portable insurance policies, which is really, in a sense, the heart of the matter, because that’s the heart of medical spending, which is a hugely costly undertaking.\So if you can’t get coverage, if you can’t get insurance coverage for basic and even critical care, you’re in a really bad place. I believe it starts with an affordable, accessible insurance policy, which we worked very hard to get and we had some success on, but we just don’t have enough of it today.\We need to do something desperately soon with the insurance companies to see why we’re not getting more affordable, accessible and portable insurance policies that can cover all segments of the population. So on one hand, it’s the federal government and, you know, it’s reimbursements on Medicaid and who qualifies at the relative levels of poverty, because each state will kind of approach it a little differently.\That discussion will continue and should. But I think the bigger issue is what are we doing to fix it at a local level in terms of basic costs for health care? And costs are skyrocketing double digit year over year. Pharmaceutical costs are a big part of that and insurance costs are a big part of that.\We can come up with solutions that address some of these areas for people who are falling through the cracks. And we have a big uninsured population, to be sure. Not as big as the nation does, but we have a big population and it’s mostly the young, immortal population, 18 to 35 or 40 years old. We’re never going to die. And even if we wanted insurance, there is nothing we can afford.\Well, that needs to be fixed. And I think we have a role to play at a local level, ultimately, in doing that.\Benjamin Wood: And marijuana?\Jon Huntsman: Well, I think there’s an argument to be made about medical marijuana. I think that the people of the state saw that, and that’s why it led to the initiative. And I think we’re probably just on the front end of the medicinal value of things that we maybe didn’t appreciate before, that for those who suffer, may have some benefits.\I don’t think we know a lot about it. But I think there is something here that is worth pursuing. Now, when you’re in pain and when you’re suffering you see the world a little differently. And I’m reflecting on a family member who went through a lot of pain and suffering recently. And he talked about medical marijuana and said, how could anyone stand up and oppose something that would help those who were suffering grievous pain and a diminished quality of life. And I tend to agree with that.\Benjamin Wood: And I do want to make sure I double up on that political question, too. So the repeal efforts by the Legislature, those are bills that land on the governor’s desk. Moving forward, we’ve already seen interest in various other initiatives, there’s one on a carbon tax that’s percolating at the moment. In the event that you find yourself in the governor’s mansion and the Legislature repeals a voter approved initiative, is that good politics? Is that appropriate?\Jon Huntsman: I don’t think it’s good public policy. I think this is where a governor should stand up between the Legislature and the people who have maybe chosen to go in a different direction and to, in a sense, reconcile some of the differences.\I think that’s what leadership is. And that’s what I think a governor should do in a situation like this. The people feel one way, the Legislature — closer to the issues and maybe to the nuances of how the sausage is made from a public policy standpoint — feel differently. Well, somebody’s got to stand in the breach and reconcile those differences. Otherwise, you know, you have an open wound, as we seem to have today.\Bethany Rodgers: I want to ask you about the issue of conversion therapy. There was a bill this last session to ban conversion therapy for underage children. And now after the failure of that bill, the governor directed an administrative process to develop rules to do the same thing.\The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints has come out opposed to the current version of the rules as drafted and have requested either significant changes or that the issue be returned to the Legislature. Do you support the rule as written? And if not, why?\Jon Huntsman: I’ll have to read up on the rule itself, but I think conversion therapy largely has been proven to be junk science. And I think the scientific community, those who are close to issues pertaining to gender and sexuality would probably say that there is not a lot there that proves that there is efficacy in using that approach.\More than that, I think it’s harmed a lot of people for life. And I think this is something we should straight up put behind us.\Benjamin Wood: Should Utah’s state flag be redesigned?\Jon Huntsman: I kind of like the way it is. We have our state symbol, which is actually enshrined in the state’s constitution. It has our motto, which is Industry, which I love, on the beehive. And it’s in a lovely blue field. I think it’s a very attractive flag. Now, I’m not an expert at this kind of thing.\Benjamin Wood: Do you think you could pick it out of a lineup if it was far away?\Jon Huntsman: I could, absolutely, and I do all the time. In your places that’s flying all 50 states, I can pick it out in a second. I think it’s actually pretty good. I wouldn’t expend a whole lot of effort trying to redesign it.\Bethany Rodgers: We’ve also heard Sen. Dan McCay has plans to sponsor legislation that would basically ban all elective abortions in the state. Meanwhile, there’s also legislation in the courts right now over the abortion bill that was passed by the Legislature this last session. Would you support a measure of the sort that Senator McCay is talking about and what are your views about how abortion should be regulated here in the state?\Jon Huntsman: I don’t like abortion. I would prefer adoption. It is a law of the land and until such time as that is overturned, it remains the law of the land. With regard to the specifics of his legislation, I’ll have to delve into that at the appropriate time. But this has come up repeatedly over the years, the same kind of thing.\And although it’s taken flight in some states, at some point the courts are going to have to step in and probably reconcile some of the differences. And I suspect that’s where the issue is headed for the most part.\Benjamin Wood: But if I could follow up, do you think that Utah should be engaged in poking at that court precedent, as some of our lawmakers are suggesting?\Jon Huntsman: Well, whether I think it’s appropriate or not it will happen, and it will happen as far as the eye can see into the future, because this is a hot-button issue. It’s a life and death issue. It’s one that polarizes people, so it’s going to be of interest to the media, to special interest groups. And it’s going to be something people talk about because there’s passion on both sides.\So the courts are going to ultimately, probably weigh in, probably in the next round or so, as they have in the past. And I think that’s probably the route this continues to take until Roe v. Wade is overturned. And I’m not sure I’ll live long enough to see that happen.\Benjamin Wood: A large portion of Salt Lake City has been set aside for the development of an inland port. I’m curious what you make of that project in general and also the approach the Legislature took in claiming authority over that area.\Jon Huntsman: The inland port concept has been talked about at least since the 1970s, and it’s what to do with vacant land out just west of the airport. And it’s now some warehousing space, Amazon has a million square foot facility out there.\You’ve got rail lines that are predominantly used by Union Pacific that make it a very good access point for goods coming in and coming out. It’s also when you look at rail, a pretty clean form of transporting goods, probably the cleanest form of all.\So could you turn that area into a vibrant transport center, that would be a part warehousing, part services, part manufacturing? I think inevitably that’s what happens. If you didn’t want to do it there, maybe you do it in the Tooele Valley.\But we are situated geographically in such a prime position and we are growing so rapidly as an economy that we are a natural hub for goods coming and going, goods where value added is made, goods that will be manufactured here, goods that will be warehouse and stored here. And that’s going to give rise to all of the allied services, whether it’s financial, whether it’s accounting, legal, logistics. These are all going to be part of it as well.\I think it can be done in ways that take into account the concerns that some have expressed with respect to the environment — where you put it, how you build it, who is co-located with it, the forms of transportation that have access to it. All of this has to be part of a master plan, ultimately.\And I think it’s a down payment long term on where our economy goes. I think ultimately it happens. I’m not quite sure where the location might be. I have my own thoughts on that, but I think this will be part of our future.\As it relates to governance, when are you not going to see city and state governments going at each other over structuring the right and appropriate governance process for something like this? That will continue. With a new mayor, I think we’ll probably see this evolve a little differently, maybe with less volume, and we’ll have to see what happens at the state level as well.\But ultimately to make this work, state and city governments are going to have to work together on the governance side. And they’re going to have to anticipate all the issues that already are out there in the public domain and make sure that the public feels good about it.\Bethany Rodgers: So just as a follow up, did you say that you have in mind alternative locations for the inland port to what’s currently in place?\Jon Huntsman: Well, we have something that’s already currently in place. You know, when I look at the 50 to 100 year horizon here in the state, I say at some point, Tooele Valley is going to come into its own. It’s going to be a second Salt Lake Valley. And wherever the inland port is situated in right now, we already have a geographical location that has been partially built out. It’s going to attract a lot of business and it’ll become a vibrant part of our Wasatch Front.\And so whether there or whether we’re looking longer term at maybe sharing some of that with an adjacent county, because based on growth, every county around Salt Lake and Utah counties is feeling that pressure — whether it’s Juab County, whether it’s Summit County, whether it’s Tooele — everyone’s feeling that pressure that’s emanating from growth on the Wasatch Front.\And we ought to think long term about how this is situated and where we want our growth patterns to exist over the next 50 to 100 years. But this comes from my earlier involvement as chair of Envision Utah. When you’re forced to look at the developable land that we’ve got, which isn’t much, and how we best utilize it going forward.\When you add another million people, as we’re about to do over the next decade, how do you shoehorn them in while maintaining quality of life, clean air, water and educational access? All this stuff is really complicated when you start adding another million people. So I think it behooves us all to think long term about how we want this densely populated metropolitan area to evolve.\And now you’ve got Washington County that is growing in a similar fashion and they’ll have the same kinds of challenges.\Bethany Rodgers: On the current transition in homeless services from the closure of The Road Home to the three new resource centers, we’ve been seeing lately some concerns over available capacity in those three new resource centers. Do you approve of the way that the state is handling those capacity concerns at this point?\Jon Huntsman: I’m not going to criticize the state, far be it for me to do that. All I can say is we did our best to eradicate homelessness when I was governor before and we came pretty close to doing that. And we did it by making it as much a humanitarian effort as anything else, realizing that you were dealing with addiction, you were dealing with some mental illness issues, people who, through no fault of their own, had fallen through safety nets in society, and most of whom wanted to get back on their feet. And that required the dignity of housing.\And so in the end, I look less at how do we deal with the cold night tonight and tomorrow night, because we have facilities that can handle that. And we’ll debate that forever as to what should be open and closed. The bigger issue is how do we bring an end to this and how do we address the underlying root causes of homelessness?\It isn’t all based on economics. When we had earlier presidential administrations, people would always blame the bad economy for homelessness. That’s part of it, but the economy is good here. We’re fully employed. So you have to look beyond just the economic, beyond the economics of homelessness, at what some of the underlying drivers are and then sort of match some of those drivers with solutions.\And I really do believe that finding transitional opportunities for the homeless, finding ways in which we can address addiction and ultimately, long term, the mental health issues that underlie a lot of this, which we know so little about — I hope we know more in the years and the decades ahead — that’s where I think our focus really needs to be. It’s how we transition people toward dignity. Get them off the streets where it becomes more of a lawless environment, where you find more drugs and violence. That’s what we’ve experienced the last little while. We’ve got to get more people working toward a transitional plan that gets them back on their feet.\Benjamin Wood: Your last lieutenant governor was Gary Herbert, our current governor. Is there anyone that you have in mind for a potential running mate? And for voters who are perhaps a little worried that you might be invited to be an ambassador again or another position in the national, international community, do you expect to finish your term if elected?\Jon Huntsman: Well, that’s a perfectly legitimate point. And I would ask it too. No, I’m not going anywhere. I’ve done my service and I’m proud to have done my service to two parties and different presidents. But it was a really tough call. And we can maybe take another time when what do you want to discuss it, what goes through the thought process when a president asks you to do something and you’ve got a commitment of this kind. You’re serving a state. You’ve been reelected. There’s a lot underway, a lot happening. And you have to make a call.\I don’t regret any of that. But I’m here to tell you, I’m not going anywhere. I’m proud of our service. I’m proud of what I did here as governor. This is our future here.\And I’m not much into the national political scene. I’ve been there. I’ve tried it. It’s a lot of wasted time, a lot of theatrics and kicking up dust and not a lot of effort that goes into problem solving, which is what I like, and preparing communities for the future. We’re here and and we’re not going anywhere.\In terms of possible lieutenant governor choices, I was greatly benefited to have Gary as as a lieutenant governor. We were friends. I used to tease him that he could interpret my English in Utah County and I could interpret his English in the rest of the state. And we had a good, division of labor. We worked well together. And I think he’s done a fine job in the intervening years. Where we go on that decision, we’ll just have to wait and see.\Bethany Rodgers: That kind of segued into the last question that at least I have. How would you grade your former lieutenant governor as governor?\Jon Huntsman: I don’t give out grades. I think that’s unfair. I wouldn’t give out a grade on myself either. But I would say he’s been a very, very dedicated governor and one who I can proudly say has taken the best of what we tried to do and kept it going and added to it where he thought it was appropriate.\Benjamin Wood: Obviously, there’s a long time to go before the election, but as things currently stand, it does appear that you’re in a top tier with Spencer Cox as a potential opponent, which is somewhat interesting in that you are Gov. Herbert’s predecessor, Spencer Cox is his current lieutenant governor. Some might view that as a natural succession, or at least in the current administration’s mind.\So for voters who are looking at this race and they’re seeing a choice between you and Spencer Cox, both men who have orbited the same kind of sphere, what case do you make to them?\Jon Huntsman: Well, I think ultimately people are going to look at experience, because past performance in the job is generally an indication of where things are going to go into the future.\We were the first statewide official to win all 29 counties. And I think that was based on a lot of hard work and a collaborative environment that we created across the partisan divide, just working to do the right thing for the people of the state. And a lot of those same issues are still with us.\I think folks are going to say, who is best equipped to address those issues based upon where they’ve been? Who’s best positioned to address our place in the world, which is going to become more and more problematic, because we’re competing not just against Nevada and Arizona and Colorado and California, we’re competing against Singapore and Hong Kong and South Korea.\And I think they’re going to say, who is best prepared to deal in an increasingly tumultuous national environment, which I think I understand pretty well, too. And who’s best positioned to see around the bend, to anticipate the challenges and to come up with public policy solutions that will protect our kids and our grandkids.\We’ve gladly had the privilege of being in that seat before. And I think we’ve proven what we can do. And we’d be greatly honored and humbled to be able to do it again.\Benjamin Wood: As a last question, I want to make sure that we acknowledge this is a somewhat delicate interview in that your brother, Paul Huntsman, is the owner and publisher of The Salt Tribune.\Jon Huntsman: Yes.\Benjamin Wood: The Salt Lake Tribune has recently been approved for a nonprofit status, but we have not yet gone through that transition. I would just be curious to ask you what you perceive as your relationship with the Tribune.\Jon Huntsman: Same as it has always been. I got your endorsement two election cycles in a row. I would not accept an endorsement today.\Benjamin Wood: Luckily, we can’t even give them out anymore.\Jon Huntsman: You don’t give them out and I wouldn’t take it if you could. But I see it as no change at all. None.\Benjamin Wood: Well, former governor, Ambassador Jon Huntsman, thank you so much for being on “Trib Talk.”\Jon Huntsman:  Ben, Bethany. It’s been a pleasure to be with you. Thanks for your time.\Crédito: By The Salt Lake Tribune"

How will future historians explain it? How will they possibly explain why President Bush decided to ignore the energy crisis staring us in the face and chose instead to spend all his electoral capital on a futile effort to undo the New Deal by partially privatizing Social Security? We are, quite simply, witnessing one of the greatest examples of misplaced priorities in the history of the U.S. presidency.
\
""Ah, Friedman, but you overstate the case."" No, I understate it. Look at the opportunities our country is missing -- and the risks we are assuming -- by having a president and vice president who refuse to lift a finger to put together a ""geo-green"" strategy that would marry geopolitics, energy policy and environmentalism.
\
By doing nothing to lower U.S. oil consumption, we are financing both sides in the war on terrorism and strengthening the worst governments in the world. That is, we are financing the U.S. military with our tax dollars, and we are financing the jihadists -- and the Saudi, Sudanese and Iranian mosques and charities that support them -- through our gasoline purchases. The oil boom is also entrenching the autocrats in Russia and Venezuela, which is becoming Castro's Cuba with oil. By doing nothing to reduce U.S. oil consumption we are also setting up a global competition with China for energy resources, including right on our doorstep in Canada and Venezuela. Don't kid yourself: China's foreign policy today is very simple -- holding on to Taiwan and looking for oil.
\
Finally, by doing nothing to reduce U.S. oil consumption we are only hastening the climate change crisis, and the Bush officials who scoff at the science around this should hang their heads in shame. And it is only going to get worse the longer we do nothing. Wired magazine did an excellent piece in its April issue about hybrid cars, which get 40 to 50 miles to the gallon with very low emissions. One paragraph jumped out at me: ""Right now, there are about 800 million cars in active use. By 2050, as cars become ubiquitous in China and India, it'll be 3.25 billion. That increase represents an almost unimaginable threat to our environment. Quadruple the cars means quadruple the carbon dioxide emissions -- unless cleaner, less gas-hungry vehicles become the norm.""
\
All the elements of what I like to call a geo-green strategy are known:
\
-- We need a gasoline tax that would keep pump prices fixed at $4 a gallon, even if crude oil prices go down. At $4 a gallon (premium gasoline averages about $6 a gallon in Europe), we could change the car-buying habits of a large segment of the U.S. public, which would make it profitable for the car companies to convert more of their fleets to hybrid or ethanol engines, which over time could sharply reduce our oil consumption.
\
-- We need to start building nuclear power plants again. The new nuclear technology is safer and cleaner than ever. ""The risks of climate change by continuing to rely on hydrocarbons are much greater than the risks of nuclear power,"" said Peter Schwartz, chairman of Global Business Network, a leading energy and strategy consulting firm. ""Climate change is real, and it poses a civilizational threat that could transform the carrying capacity of the entire planet.""
\
-- And we need some kind of carbon tax that would move more industries from coal to wind, hydro and solar power, or other, cleaner fuels. The revenue from these taxes would go to pay down the deficit, and the reduction in oil imports would help to strengthen the dollar and defuse competition for energy with China.

It's smart geopolitics. It's smart fiscal policy. It is smart climate policy. Most of all, it's smart politics. Even evangelicals are speaking out about our need to protect God's green earth. ""The Republican Party is much greener than George Bush or Dick Cheney,"" remarked Schwartz. ""There is now a near convergence of support on the environmental issue. Look at how popular Arnold Schwarzenegger, a green Republican, is becoming because of what he has done on the environment in California.""
\
Imagine if Bush declared that he was getting rid of his limousine for an armor-plated Ford Escape hybrid, adopting a geo-green strategy and building an alliance of neocons, evangelicals and greens to sustain it. His popularity at home -- and abroad -- would soar. The country is dying to be led on this. Instead, he prefers to squander his personal energy trying to take apart the New Deal and throwing red meat to right-to-life fanatics. What a waste of a presidency. How will future historians explain it?

There are parallels to be drawn between indulgences of the 16th century and today's cap and trade. The complaints Martin Luther nailed to the church door at Wittenberg suggest he doubted that the driving force behind the sin license was the welfare of the sinner's soul. Congressional motives behind the carbon tax are not any purer. Would this government seizure of industrial earnings be used to rescue the environment? Social Security stands as a monument to the pains taken by Congress to apply funds to the purposes for which they are collected.

136,"\Here is a thought experiment. Suppose women get so mad over the Kavanaugh confirmation that Democrats get control of the House and Senate.\President Trump, wanting to be considered “the greatest president ever,” decides to become an advocate of average Americans. He and Democrats pass affordable health care for all, a simple graduated income tax (where the first $30K is taxed at 1 percent, the next $30K at 2 percent and so on with income over $1M plus paying 50 percent, no loopholes, no gimmicks), a gradually increasing carbon tax creating jobs (building efficient vehicles and buildings) and cleaning our environment, reasonable gun regulation, etc.\He fires his entire Cabinet and puts in place people who will support the agencies they oversee. He works off a list of progressive judges and justices to fill court positions. For average Americans, taxes would go down. By taxing the rich at higher rates, there would be more revenue for social programs, for improved infrastructure, and to help bring down the deficit. Our economy would be more stable and perform better. Working Americans would have health care, affordable housing and money to spend.\Yes, this is not likely, but it is refreshing to imagine.\Mark Rothacher\Salt Lake City\CREDIT: Mark Rothacher, Deseret News"
137,"In the Third District congressional debate, Congressman Jason Chaffetz questioned the science of climate change, suggesting scientists couldn't make credible predictions about the climate because weathermen often are wrong in predicting the weather. Mr. Chaffetz's position puts him at odds with virtually all of the world's climate scientists, including our own in Utah, as well as many fellow Republicans.\A growing number of Republican statesmen recognize the threats and risks of climate change. President George W. Bush, in his 2007 State of Union address, spoke of confronting ""the serious challenge of global climate change."" Henry Paulson, President Bush's Secretary of the Treasury, wrote in June of this year about climate change, noting the similarities to the 2008 financial crisis saying, ""We're making the same mistake today with climate change. We're staring down a climate bubble that poses enormous risks to our environment and economyccc""\And Mitt Romney's economic advisor, Greg Mankiw, supports a carbon tax to address climate change.\Contrast these statements to Congressman Chaffetz' assertion in the debate that, ""I believe the Al Gore-defined climate change is a farce."" Such an assertion should give the voters of the Third District, especially conservatives, serious pause to whether they are best represented by an elected official who dismisses an increasingly important issue.\A.

140,"The following editorial appeared in Thursday's Washington Post:\So the climate talks at the Group of Eight summit in L'Aquila, Italy, with the world's 17 major greenhouse gas emitters didn't go as planned. Unrest back home forced Chinese President Hu Jintao to leave before he could get down to negotiating with an engaged American president.\Developing nations balked at committing to long-term emissions reductions goals because industrialized countries balked at setting short-term targets. And they were none too pleased that rich nations wouldn't make a firm commitment to help them deal with the effects of climate change. All this spells disaster if you have a glass-half-empty worldview.\But take a look at what was accomplished. All of the nations agreed that the Earth's average temperature should not rise more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels. The eight leading industrial nations agreed to slash their greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050. This is an improvement over the 50 percent reduction that the G-8 agreed to last year and now puts the industrialized world in sync with what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says is needed to halt the catastrophic consequences of climate change. President Obama played an active role in getting this done, quite a change from the foot-dragging and denial that characterized U.S. climate change policy under President George W. Bush.\That's not to say that all's smooth sailing to the big climate treaty talks in Copenhagen in December. In addition to the big hurdles mentioned above, the baseline year is fluid -- based on emission levels ""compared to 1990 or more recent years."" Many European countries wanted reductions based on 1990 levels. The recently passed American Clean Energy and Recovery Act (a.k.a. Waxman-Markey) is pegged to 2005 levels. And thus our attention moves from the hobbled progress abroad to the chaotic road to consensus at home on climate change legislation that Obama can take to Denmark.\Even with all the compromises, directives, subsidies and other giveaways hurled at members to secure their votes, Waxman-Markey barely made it out of the House last month. It calls for a 17 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 below 2005 levels. It would also give away 85 percent of the pollution credits in the initial years of a complicated cap-and-trade system that would put a price on carbon through a declining cap on emissions set by the federal government. That's a far cry from the 100 percent auction of pollution allowances advocated by Obama as a presidential candidate.\Sadly, we have no confidence that things will improve in the Senate. Despite holding a news conference in February declaring that the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee would be ""starting fresh"" and that ""we're willing to look at everything,"" Chairman Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., is using the cap-and-trade provisions of Waxman-Markey as the template for her committee's bill.\Her committee staff promises that members are being creative in looking at how to do things differently to achieve the bill's goals. Unless that includes serious consideration of a properly designed carbon tax or a cleaner cap-and-trade system that auctions a majority of the emissions credits and rebates the money to taxpayers, that's a promise that won't be fulfilled.\Credit: The Salt Lake Tribune"
141,"If you're a political conservative, don't feel so picked on by the Stalinist Democratic Party. It doesn't allow dissent among its own ranks either, being the party of the ideological straitjacket.\In watching some of the clips from the Democratic climate change marathon, I was struck by how willing each candidate was to grovel and play dumb to retain favor with the crazy leftist base. And that should tell us all we need to know about how dangerous this party is for America.\""You didn't watch the entire thing?"" you ask. No, sorry, I do have some self-respect.\How these reckless clowns could persuade even 10 percent of voters to support them in a general election is a disturbingly sad commentary on the state of our electorate.\Each candidate was more ridiculous than the next. It was a painful spectacle to endure.\Kamala Harris seemed to realize how ridiculous she sounded when she said she would favor banning plastic straws. Saying something has to be done, she descended into inane laughter about the difficulty in using paper straws. Seriously? This is what animates them today?\Andrew Yang, when the time is right, might ban commercial air travel. He also mentioned the possible confiscation of gas vehicles and refused to rule out making electric cars mandatory. Suggested Democrat campaign slogan: ""Vote for us and we'll lead you back to the Stone Age — a time of environmental sensitivity and equal income distribution.""\Elizabeth Warren crusaded against straws, and cheeseburgers, too. Why would Trump focus on economic growth, spreading wealth and reducing unemployment for all Americans when he could prioritize their nutrition awareness? Republicans should be ashamed of their obvious indifference to the federal government's proper role in our dining decisions — and federally mandated exercise, for that matter. Now I know what Democrats mean when they say we don't care. Indeed, Bernie Sanders is right to advocate curbing population growth. Capping population will facilitate economic malaise, thus ending the rich's stranglehold on all that stuff they want their voters to covet.\Warren also favors a new carbon tax. Duh. Pretty soon she'll get on board and propose a tax on economic growth as well. Oh, wait, that's essentially the Democratic Party platform, so that would be superfluous, so let me retract that. But Warren's proposal is anemic compared with Joe Biden's plan to shut down all electricity generated by coal power, which amounts to about 27 percent. Then again, Uncle Joe has got to do something to steal attention from these newbies.\Harris' straw purge, however, apparently wasn't sexy enough, so she would also ban fracking. She has to be on board the party's consensus to zap economic growth. What better way than to eliminate the very process that has made us a net exporter of oil for the first time in 75 years? Just in case there's any doubt, Democrats also specified that they would end oil and gas exploration on public lands.\Finally, a candidate figured out a way to merge racism with environmentalism — like Democrats have wedded race to every other issue. Julian Castro promised that he would make it easier for Americans to file lawsuits over ""environmental racism."" I don't know about you, but that's certainly a hot-button issue for everyone in my circle of friends and business associates. Kudos to Julian, who also astutely observed, ""I guess it's 11 years we have left."" I could have sworn it was 12 years, but what's wrong with a minor hyperbole if it serves the cause of pantheistic idolatry?\One undeniable truth is that even if you accept every outlandish and bizarre claim Democrats make on the environment, we could not appreciably reduce global temperature in a hundred years, even if we were to implement all their draconian remedies.\They're either crazy with the heat — or just unabashed socialists using environmental fearmongering to advance their glorious cause.\David Limbaugh is a writer, author and attorney.

142,"This week, Pope Francis is expected to implore both the U.S. Congress and the UN General Assembly to take aggressive steps to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. His thinking on this issue is not simple alarm over climate change. It involves an extraordinary combination of passionate environmentalism, concern for the poor, skepticism about economics and apparent hostility to ""profits."" All this makes for an impressive but occasionally awkward argument.\In his recent book-length encyclical on the subject, Pope Francis seeks to link three seemingly unrelated problems: environmental degradation, poverty and spiritual emptiness. He wants to ""replace consumption with sacrifice, greed with generosity, wastefulness with a spirit of sharing."" Time and again, he points to ""consumerism"" as a major source of the world's problems.\Human beings are endangering the planet as a result of ""a period of irrational confidence in progress and human abilities,"" the pope says. Dirty air produces millions of premature deaths. Our ""throwaway society"" fouls our waters and produces more waste than we can handle. Limiting climate change requires ""changes of lifestyle, production and consumption.""\For poor people who are already struggling, Pope Francis shows, a warmer climate will make things far worse. While climate change threatens all nations, developing countries are at special risk, not least because they depend on agriculture, fishing and forestry, all of which are threatened by rising temperatures. In the encyclical, the word ""poor"" appears 61 times.\At this point, you might expect that he would explore the difficult trade-offs that leaders of developing nations ccc including China, India, and Brazil ccc face. They have been working to reduce poverty through rapid economic growth, and that takes more energy, not less. For what they see as moral reasons, these leaders prioritize growth, not reductions in carbon emissions. Can poor nations ccc or, for that matter, rich ones ccc be expected to bear the costs of significantly scaling back?\That's mostly an economic question, but Pope Francis seems skeptical about how much economists can help. In the face of environmental risks, he insists that we ""reject a magical conception of the market, which would suggest that problems can be solved simply by an increase in the profits of companies or individuals.""\Fair enough. But economists don't favor such a magical conception. They believe that the best way to reduce pollution, including greenhouse-gas emissions, is to require people to ""internalize"" the environmental costs ccc for example, through carbon taxes.\Pope Francis is not enthusiastic about that idea, because it would impose significant costs on poor nations, perpetrating an injustice ""under the guise of protecting the environment.""\For similar reasons, he disapproves of buying and selling ""carbon credits"" ccc a system of cap and trade, another idea that economists like. He objects that it wouldn't ""allow for the radical change which present circumstances require,"" and might turn out to be ""a ploy which permits maintaining the excessive consumption of some countries and sectors.""\Instead, the Pope argues, there is an ""urgent need for us to move forward in a bold cultural revolution."" Really? If so, how can we get there?\The great University of Chicago law professor Karl Llewellyn is reported to have said, ""Technique without morals is a menace; but morals without technique is a mess.""\At their best, economists are excellent technicians. They tell us how to achieve our preferred goals. And in so doing, they also turn out to be pretty decent moralists.\Lifting people out of poverty is a moral imperative. If economists can help us to find an efficient way to address environmental problems, including climate change, we will minimize adverse effects on growth, which is humanity's best way to reduce poverty and increase employment. Growth is often propelled by ""consumerism,"" which should not be treated as an evil.\It's true that any carbon tax or system of cap and trade would have to be tailored to national circumstances. A poor nation might not be able to handle a tax as high as one that would work well in France or Germany.\But pleas for ""a bold cultural revolution"" are unlikely to persuade leaders of the world's nations ccc rich or poor ccc to join such an agreement. What's needed is a demonstration that emissions limits really are in the interest of their people.\No one should question the encyclical's extraordinary moral clarity and powerful conviction. But with respect to technique, it's a bit messy.\Cass Sunstein, a Bloomberg View columnist, is director of the Harvard Law School's program on behavioral economics and public policy.\Credit: By Cass Sunstein Bloomberg View"
143,"
WASHINGTON -- How is it possible that BP chief executive Tony Hayward hasn't been fired? At this point, how can anyone believe a word he says? If he told me my mother loves me, I'd want a second source.
\
Hayward apologized for his lapse of candor -- the whine Sunday that ""I'd like my life back."" It must be a nice life: According to Forbes, Hayward's compensation from BP in 2009 was about $4.6 million. The fishermen who've been put out of work by the oil spill are accustomed to getting by on considerably less. In a Facebook posting, Hayward said his callous words ""don't represent how I feel about this tragedy and certainly don't represent the hearts of the people of BP.""
\
Within hours, though, Hayward's foot was firmly lodged in his mouth again. The effort to contain the oil has been ""very successful,"" he told the Financial Times. ""Considering how big this has been, very little has got away from us.""
\
This sunny assessment came as TV networks broadcast images of oil-soaked marshes, where hazmat-suited workers -- who said they were under orders from BP not to talk to the media, on pain of getting fired -- were trying to sop up the mess with what looked like rags. Meanwhile, mousselike clumps of ""weathered"" oil were being washed onto beaches in Alabama, and authorities in Florida were watching the approach of a menacing, oily sheen. Scientists have not even begun to assess the potential long-term effects of the oil spill. Carol Browner, the president's chief adviser on energy and the environment, said the Deepwater Horizon incident is already the worst environmental disaster in United States history.
\
Give yourself another pat on the back, Tony.
\
Adm. Thad Allen, who is directing the response effort, is a nice guy -- but in terms of his public handling of BP, too nice. On Thursday, as BP proceeded with its latest attempt to cap the flow, Allen praised the company for providing several camera views of the action on the sea floor. But for weeks, BP refused to make public any television images of the oil leak and relented only under pressure from U.S. officials.
\
Hayward's statements have been unreliable, and it hardly matters whether he's being deliberately misleading or just overly optimistic. The giant containment dome was going to work; it didn't. The second, smaller containment dome would do the job; it was never deployed. The ""top kill"" procedure was surely going to stop the flow. Yet oil industry veterans such as T. Boone Pickens said the top kill was a long shot at best, and they were right.
\
As for those giant underwater oil plumes that scientists and journalists keep discovering? Hayward denies they exist. His position is that of a philanderer caught in the act by an irate spouse: ""Who are you going to believe, me or your lying eyes?""
\
Since the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig six weeks ago, BP's stock has lost more than a third of its value. Two ratings firms, Fitch and Moody's, have downgraded the company's long-term debt, and estimates of what it will finally cost BP to stop the leak and clean up its mess range from $3 billion to $30 billion. All this happened on Hayward's watch.
\
Somebody, please, give the man his life back.
\
But once that's done, let's turn our ire on the real villains. This exercise will require a mirror.
\
An accident like the Deepwater Horizon blowout was bound to happen sooner or later. There are nearly 4,000 oil rigs off the Gulf Coast, and those pumping most of the crude are in deep waters -- where, as we now know, state-of-the-art safety procedures are inadequate. President Barack Obama's moratorium on deep-water drilling will last only long enough for some sort of technological bandage to be devised. Then we'll crank up the drills once again.
\
We know our dependence on oil is ruinous, yet we refuse to take measures -- a meaningful carbon tax, for example -- to ease it. Long after Tony Hayward answers for his sins, we'll be paying for our own.

There are compelling reasons, both moral and economic, against investing money in a fossil fuel industry that promises to continue threatening our health, our environment and ultimately the future of life as we know it on this planet. Our current fossil fuel energy policy promises us a pyramid scheme, under which our children sit waiting to be crushed by the weight of our own nearsightedness. Pyramids are homes for the dead. But there is hope for the living on the horizon. Since the divestment from fossil fuels movement began, over 70 colleges, universities, city governments, foundations and pension funds have pledged to divest from fossil fuels, and movements to divest are currently going on at over 300 institutions of higher education across our country.
\
Moral arguments aside, there are some compelling economic reasons to avoid investing in fossil fuels. In a recent interview, President Obama indicated that we can't allow more than one-third of our known reserves to be developed if we hope to have any sort of a livable future. That means that fossil fuel companies will eventually have to write off a large portion of these unrecoverable assets on their balance sheets. Robert Litterman, an executive at Goldman Sachs, is advising university endowment managers that many carbon-based assets are ""stranded"" and they must hedge against losses, disinvestment being one way to hedge. The point is that these are no longer economic theories; the market is already reacting to the risks of carbon-based energy. But has the market factored in the full potential of all of the risks?
\
Former SEC Commissioner Bevis Longstreth saw the handwriting on the wall when he concluded his argument for divesting from fossil fuels, and predicted that there will soon be a time when for a fiduciary ""... continuing to hold equities in fossil fuel companies will be ruled negligence.""
\
While the cost of locating, recovering and transporting fossil fuels increases every year, the cost of renewables has been going down dramatically. They will continue to drop as new technologies are developed. A case in point: in Texas, Austin Energy recently signed a 25-year power purchase agreement with Sun Edison for 150 megawatts of solar power at slightly less than $.05 per kilowatt-hour. It is estimated that the same amount of energy from natural gas would have cost $.07, $.10 from coal, and $.13 from nuclear.
\
Hardly a week goes by when we don't hear of another oil spill, pipeline rupture, tank car explosion or other environmental disaster related to fossil fuels. These companies have avoided paying the full cost of these disasters for too long and that is beginning to change. Look at the billions that the BP oil spill cost, and they will be litigating civil suits in this case for years to come. Taxpayer bailouts are decreasing rapidly and more regulation and stiffer penalties are likely coming along with diminishing government subsidies and benefits.
\
There is growing support for carbon tax on fossil fuels. There are a lot of good proposals for putting a price on carbon - such as the fee and dividend that the Citizens Climate Lobby advocates. Their initiative would put a fee on carbon at its source and refund the money to the citizens making it revenue neutral.
\
These are only a few of the many reasons why continuing to invest in fossil fuels is a bad idea. Abandoning carbon-based energy is a conservative investment strategy that matches Utah's wise conservative financial character. Utahn's believe that unnecessary debt and risk taking is inappropriate for the investment of public funds. It is time the Utah citizens live up to the ideals of our own conservative financial principles. For the sake of prudent financial management, it is time for Utah to divest from companies whose primary business consists of fossil fuel production.

145,"Well, it’s “official” now. The Trump administration has stated that human-caused global warming is real (see the latest National Climate Assessment), even though the president remains skeptical. More dire and catastrophic events are predicted unless mitigating action is taken to slow greenhouse gas emissions.\The scientific community overwhelmingly has viewed HCGW as “settled science.” Carbon dioxide levels are now nearing 410 parts per million, the highest level ever recorded in the history of the planet, going back hundreds of thousands of years. The rapidly increasing CO2 levels correlate with increased worldwide fossil fuel use.\Climatologists are alarmed at the rapid and unprecedented changes they are seeing. James Balog, who publicized the effects of climate change by video recording the accelerated melting of glaciers in the 2012 documentary “Chasing Ice,” stated that water levels could rise 1.5 to 3 feet during his daughter’s lifetime, based on the rate of rapid melting he observed of glaciers and massive ice-sheets worldwide. He estimated this could displace up to 150 million people now living in coastal areas. Now, in the new NCA report, the latest prediction is that water levels will rise 1 foot per decade until 2100.\Great ecological damage will continue to occur in our oceans. More than 90 percent of increased atmospheric heat is absorbed by ocean water. Ocean warming led to the loss of nearly 30 percent of the coral in the Great Barrier Reef in 2016, and more than 60 percent coral death in the warmer northern areas of the Great Barrier Reef, where water temperatures reached 95 degrees F.\Based on the present trajectory of the warming oceans, experts predict most of the world’s coral will die within 30 years. As about 25 percent of marine life depends on coral reefs to survive, and up to 1 billion people in the world depend on marine life as their sole protein source, this is a nightmare scenario.\According to the most recent report issued in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a 1.5-degree C (or 2.7-degree F) rise is a threshold that we cannot cross without experiencing some of the worst destructive effects of climate change. The report predicts this increase will be reached by 2030, which gives us only 12 years to act decisively.\President Donald Trump, who could remain in office another six years, has shown his disdain and ignorance of HCGW, calling it a hoax. He is gutting environmental laws and continues to promote coal-generated power when natural gas is a better alternative, generating 50 percent less greenhouse gas than coal. And it’s less costly!\Protecting the environment and jobs are not mutually exclusive or at odds with each other. Development of new energy technologies will lead to job creation. Harnessing the skills of our talented engineers and scientists in crash programs, as we did in the Apollo Project, would be a good first step. A concept that is showing progress and still has a way to go is Elon Musk’s vision to develop affordable electric vehicles that can be recharged at solar-powered charging facilities. Fortunately, wind- and solar-generated power are gaining traction!\As citizens, we should encourage responsible Republicans and Democrats at the state and national levels to set their differences aside and unite, with a sense of moral and ethical responsibility, to initiate programs and sensible regulations (like meaningful carbon tax legislation or reinstating higher fuel mileage standards) that will vigorously combat HCGW. The smart Republicans who accept the science will likely bear the burden of persuading the Trump administration to reverse its negative climate policies.\I enjoy the outdoor recreational opportunities that Utah offers each of us. As an avid skier, I wonder, for example, if we will have enough natural snow in the future to even enjoy the sport. Short-term, will we have enough snow to adequately host the 2030 Olympics? In the future, will Utah residents be able to engage safely in their favorite summer activities in air that is almost continuously smoke-filled?\The welfare of future generations depends on the measures we take in the critical years ahead to combat global warming. While we have immediate issues that most of us want addressed — such as affordable health care and sensible gun controls — let’s not falter in caring for Mother Earth as well. Controlling climate warming will be one of man’s greatest challenges in the years ahead.\Karl Sears, Ph.D., is a retired chemist with numerous research publications and patents.

146," Utah is joining a regional push to cut greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming through a carbon cap-and-trade program, Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. announced Tuesday.\A proposal crafted through the Western Climate Initiative aims to reduce carbon dioxide and other gas emissions by 15 percent by 2020.\But the plan for now is just a framework, ""the beginning of extensive discussions that will continue with our Legislature and stakeholders to ensure the design works for Utah,"" said Dianne Nielson, Huntsman's energy policy adviser.\Already, though, some state lawmakers worry that the initiative could hinder the state's economic growth.\""We want to protect the environment. We want to protect the air quality and do all those things . . . but we want to make sure that the coal industry and some of these that are important economic drivers for our state"" are not harmed, said House Speaker Greg Curtis, R-Sandy, who was briefed on the program Monday.\As proposed, the Western Climate Initiative, which includes seven Western states and four Canadian provinces, will use emissions from 2010 as a baseline for cap-and-trade.\Beginning in 2012, each partner will be granted emission ""allowances"" that will move the state to the WCI's goal.\It then will be up to each state or province to decide how to distribute its allowance.\Carbon ""offset"" credits from uncapped sectors or entities that reduce emissions could be auctioned.\Nielson said that Utah's approach to greenhouse gas reductions would be spelled out in a bill to be written for the 2010 Legislature.\A task force - composed of lawmakers, executive branch representatives, industry, utilities, energy producers, consumer groups, environmental advocates, local government and others - would be assembled to nail down the details the bill would include, she said.\Under the WCI framework, emissions would be rigorously monitored. If a company, utility or some other entity doesn't have enough allowances to cover its emissions, it could lose some of its allowances as a penalty, forcing it either to buy more credits or cut its emissions.\When Huntsman enlisted the state in the Western Climate Initiative in 2007, some lawmakers were irritated that they weren't consulted first. A bill aimed at limiting the governor's power to enter into such agreements in the future passed the Legislature by an overwhelming margin last session, but Huntsman vetoed it and agreed to consult with legislative leaders before he commits the state to future partnerships.\Curtis said lawmakers want to know more about the cap-and-trade plan.\""I don't feel like we've been deeply consulted,"" said Curtis, who had a planned meeting on the proposal with the governor Monday, but it was replaced with discussion of the state's $272 million budget shortfall.\WCI proponents say that, in addition to reducing emissions, the plan would ease dependence on fossil fuels and spawn new ""green"" industries.\Utah Clean Energy executive director Sarah Wright said Utah's approach likely would be conservative because the state could achieve the ""cap"" part of the plan largely through an aggressive energy efficiency program Huntsman already has in place.\""It's not a sea change in the way we generate and use energy,"" Wright said. ""We're not going to be closing down coal plants.""\Nielson said the WCI wanted a cap-and-trade plan rather than a carbon tax, which would have been more expensive.\""We want it to be an affordable system,"" she said. ""We're looking to be sure we have a diversified energy base, and that includes coal,"" she said.\Britt Weygandt, executive director of the Western Business Roundtable, a pro-industry group, said the organization is still examining the WCI plan. However, he said, a regional cap-and-trade system ""would dramatically increase costs to consumers in the West of virtually everything we buy.""\That's not how the Union of Concerned Scientists sees it. Christopher Bush, a UCS climate economist, said analyses conclude that region's economy would benefit from investments in global warming solutions.\Plan includes seven Western states, four Canadian provinces The Western Climate Initiative includes Arizona, California, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington and Canadian provinces British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec.\The group has advanced a plan to reduce global warming pollution by capping greenhouse gas emissions and allowing auctions or trades of credits allocated according to a monitored system.\Each state and province will create its own path to the overall goal of reducing emissions to 2005 levels by 2020.\In Utah, a panel of interest groups will craft necessary policy for consideration by the 2010 Legislature.\All large utilities and industries that emit more than the equivalent of 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases must by federal law submit a report on their actual emissions by 2011.\The deadline for WCI member states and provinces to implement their cap-and-trade systems is 2012.\Credit: Robert Gehrke and Patty Henetz The Salt Lake Tribune"
147,"A legislative panel directed its staff lawyers Wednesday to begin drafting legislation to make it easier for nuclear power to be developed in Utah.\The Legislature's Interim Public Utilities and Technology Committee said nuclear plants should be considered as part of the solution for growth in the state's energy demand even though the state's energy task force had not deemed nuclear a high priority.\""We left it unsaid, is what we did,"" said Rep. Roger Barrus, a Centerville Republican and task force member.\He noted that lawmakers had to deal with the subject delicately at the time because of the state's opposition to the Skull Valley high-level nuclear waste storage project. He added that supporting nuclear was ""not politically appropriate at the time.""\Rep. Mike Noel, R-Kanab, made a floor amendment last year that added nuclear development in the state's energy policy.\He sparked discussion of the issue in the Legislature once again by asking staff to report on a Florida law to promote nuclear development.\Currently, there are no electricity-producing reactors in the state.\At Wednesday's meeting Utah energy providers added their voices in support of nuclear power during a discussion of Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr.'s decision to sign up for the Western Climate Initiative, an ambitious regional plan to cut the pollution blamed for climate change.\The four representatives from Utah-based power providers agreed that the technology available to make pollution cuts is lagging far behind the goals outlined in the six-state agreement Utah's governor joined in May.\The pact, led by California, would set up a system to measure and later reduce greenhouse gasses, including carbon dioxide, methane and other pollution tied to climate change.\And, while some Utah businesses want guidance on adapting to a world in which those gasses are controlled, at least three of the companies attacked the Western Climate Initiative as wrongheaded and costly.\""I'm questioning why does the state of Utah rush headlong into a program that has very uncertain and probably very high costs at the risk of extreme damage to the economy,"" said Kimball Rassmussen, president and chief executive officer for the Deseret Power Electric Cooperative.\Rassmussen, a member of Huntsman's Blue Ribbon Advisory Council on Climate Change, said his members support clean-environment efforts. But they see no technologies on the horizon to help them curb the greenhouse gas emissions that may soon be subjected to a carbon tax.\Similar concerns were raised by Reed Searle, general manager of Intermountain Power Agency. IPA operates a 1,700 megawatt, two-unit power plant in Delta, Millard County, that sends about 80 percent of its electricity to California.\He told lawmakers it's a bad idea to adopt any of California's climate-change programs, even though the need to deal with global warming ""cannot be ignored by any utility."" He said the state should instead support a national program, rather than a West-Coast initiative that is anti-coal.\""Frankly, we don't comprehend how this can be dealt with on a regional basis,"" he said.\All four power-company representatives said that nuclear energy needs to be part of any solution. \Kyle L. Davis, manager of environmental policy and strategy for PacifiCorp, the parent company of Rocky Mountain Power, urged lawmakers to focus on providing incentives for innovation in carbon-reducing technologies.\Noting that his company does business in five of the six Western Climate Initiative states, he said a variety of strategies are needed to cope with the growth in energy demand at the same time greenhouse gasses are being cut.\It will probably take a decade or more for new nuclear plants to come on line, so that means other low-carbon energy sources - including renewable-energy sources like wind power - need to be developed. He also said improved technology and a better regulatory climate for carbon capture should be a priority.\""There is a lot of work that needs to be done today,"" said Davis.\Lawmakers challenged Dianne Nielson, Huntsman's energy adviser, on why the state is ""buying into"" the idea that mankind is behind climate change and has the power to stop it.\Nielson said, however, that the initiative is ""not a vote on climate change"" but a recognition that businesses and government are moving forward in addressing the issue.\""If we are going to compete,"" she told the panel, ""these are issues we ought to deal with.""\fahys@sltrib.com\Credit: By Judy Fahys The Salt Lake Tribune"
148,"I don't expect much from the G-20 meeting this week, but if I had my wish, the leaders of the world's 20 top economies would commit themselves to a new standard of accounting -- call it ""Market to Mother Nature"" accounting. Why? Because it's now obvious that the reason we're experiencing a simultaneous meltdown in the financial and climate systems is because we have been mispricing risk in both arenas -- producing a huge excess of both toxic assets and toxic air that now threatens the stability of the whole planet.\Just as AIG sold insurance derivatives at prices that did not reflect the real costs and the real risks of massive defaults (for which we the taxpayers ended up paying the difference), oil companies, coal companies and electric utilities today are selling energy products at prices that do not reflect the real costs to the environment and real risks of disruptive climate change (so future taxpayers will end up paying the difference).\When products don't reflect the real costs and risks associated with their use, people use to excess. And that's what happened in the financial and energy/environmental marketplaces.\Our biggest financial-services companies, some of which came to be seen as too big to fail, engaged in complex financial trading schemes that did not adequately price in the costs and risks of a market reversal. AIG, for instance, was selling insurance for all kinds of financial instruments and did not have anywhere near adequate reserves to cover claims if things went badly wrong, as they did. And our biggest energy companies, utilities and auto companies became dependent on cheap hydrocarbons that spin off climate-changing greenhouse gases, and we clearly have not forced them, through a carbon tax, to price in the true risks and costs to society from these climate-changing fuels.\""When the balance sheet of a company does not capture the true costs and risks of its business activities,"" and when that company is too big to fail, ""you end up with them privatizing their gains and socializing their losses,"" Nandan Nilekani, the co-chairman of the Indian technology company Infosys, remarked to me. That is, everyone gets to rack up their private profits today and pay them out in current bonuses and dividends. But any catastrophic losses -- if the company is too big to fail -- ""get socialized and paid off by taxpayers.""\This is why we need new banking regulation that reins in the leverage and speculative trading that big banks and insurance companies can undertake so they never again become simultaneously too reckless to regulate but too big fail and taxpayers are forced to pay off the toxic assets they accumulate. And this is also why we need a tax on carbon -- so we and our power utilities don't become permanently addicted to cheap coal that makes for lower electricity prices today but spits out toxic greenhouse gases that have to be paid for by future generations tomorrow.\That's what ""Market to Mother Nature"" accounting is all about. It begins with the premise that the distinction between the G-20 and the Copenhagen climate change negotiations is totally artificial. They are just flip sides of the same global problem -- how we as a world keep raising standards of living for more and more people in ways that will not, as a byproduct, have both the Market and Mother Nature producing huge amounts of toxic assets.\The old system, which has reached its financial and environmental limits, worked like this: We built more and more stores in America to sell more and more stuff, which was made in more and more Chinese factories powered by more and more coal that earned more and more dollars to buy even more U.S. T-bills that got recycled back to America in the form of cheap credit to build more and more stores and more and more houses that gave rise to more and more Chinese factories ...\This system was a powerful engine of wealth creation and lifted millions out of poverty, but it relied upon the risks to the Market and to Mother Nature being underpriced and to profits being privatized in good times and losses socialized in bad times. This capitalist engine doesn't need to be discarded; it needs some fixes. For starters, we need to get back to basics -- accountable lending, prudent saving, reasonable leveraging and more engineering of industrial products rather than just financial products.\Some of our biggest financial firms got away from their original purpose -- to fund innovation and to finance the process of ""creative destruction,"" whereby new technologies that improve people's lives replace old ones, said the Columbia University economist Jagdish Bhagwati, in an interview in The American Interest. Instead, he added, too many banks got involved in exotic and incomprehensible financial innovations -- to simply make money out of money -- which ended up as ""destructive creation.""\""Destructive creation"" has wounded both the Market and Mother Nature. Smart regulation and carbon taxation can heal both.\Credit: The Salt Lake Tribune"
149,"No one can say for sure the world is warming as a result of climate change, but this much is certain: the debate is heating up and may reach the boiling point before an international treaty is signed this year.\As officials from 160 countries meet in Germany this week to hammer out steps to curb emissions of greenhouse gases, scientific critics, businesses and even developing nations began contesting negotiations of what is the most complex and contentious global environmental treaty ever.\New studies backed by industry-related groups predict economic chaos in the developed world -- and the United States in particular -- if ambitious targets are set. At the same time, critics complain too much of the burden falls on wealthy nations, and poor nations say wealthy ones are trying to maintain an energy-rich diet at their expense.\The stakes are huge, the negotiations more costly and controversial than any previous agreement -- including the recent Montreal Protocol to phase out use and production of chemicals that deplete the ozone layer.\``This is uncharted territory,'' said Rafe Pomerance, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for the environment. ``The future of the world's climate is in the hands of the nations of the world.''\The administration has hinted it intends to act aggressively. President Clinton brought up the issue in his State of the Union address, and while U.S. has not yet set domestic targets for cutting emissions, they created a rumble in December by proposing targets be binding, not voluntary.\The talks will end in Japan in December when an agreement is signed by all 160 countries, but this week industry groups in the United States said there was too much of a rush to finish.\There is no sacred schedule, said John Shlaes, director of the Global Climate Coalition, a group representing more than 230,000 companies including the petroleum, chemical, and power-generating industries. ``Delegates are being pushed to act now . . . without adequate information.''\Last week, his organization released a study predicting a loss of billions of dollars a year -- as much as 4.3 percent of gross domestic product of industrialized nations. Another recent study concluded reducing carbon-dioxide emissions to 1990 levels would cost America $350 billion and 1.1 million jobs a year.\But most economic studies of the effect of curtailing greenhouse gases are misleading, a new ``megastudy'' maintains. The analysis of 13 of the most commonly cited studies shows ``you can't take these at face value,'' said Robert Repetto of the World Resources Institute in Washington. ``Basically, you can tailor them to any result you want.''\Repetto's study, to be published in April, shows the most dire economic projections assume there are no other sources of energy, that the economy has no flexibility, and that taxes on fossil fuels aren't used to help cover costs.\Said Repetto: ``More realistically, if you phase in a carbon tax with a lot of time to adjust, and use it to offset other taxes, the economic impact would be small, and that's not even counting any potential health benefits.''\While there still is scientific controversy about global warming, internationally accepted research predicts that as fossil fuels continue to be burned, they will accumulate and raise temperatures in the atmosphere by as much as 3.5 degrees Centigrade by the year 2100. Ocean temperatures and sea levels will rise as well, and many small island countries could disappear.\America is the largest consumer of energy, and industrialized nations now account for the lion's share of the world's energy budget. But within 50 years, as much as three-fourths of greenhouse gases will be emitted by developing nations. Critics use this to argue the unfairness of the treaty, which would require only developed nations to adhere to a fossil-fuel emissions budget.\``Meanwhile, China and India and all those developing countries don't have to do anything, and they're going to be burning coal and shipping us goods,'' said Thomas Gale Moore, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford.\Some developing nations, in turn, are protesting one of the treaty's more innovative suggestions: a concept called ``joint implementation'' that would allow industrialized countries to pay for greenhouse-gas reduction efforts in poor countries to offset their own emissions.\Because the United States is so energy-efficient, the cost of making it more so would better be spent in poor nations where there is no pollution control or energy-efficiency at all, proponents say. Poor countries argue it is a scheme to allow rich nations to continue using huge quantities of fossil fuels.\Because the Senate must ratify any treaty with a two-thirds vote, many doubt this country will ever sign it. But proponents take heart in the 1987 Montreal Protocol. In January 1996, less than 10 years after the treaty was signed, chemical producers stopped making ozone-depleting chemicals for use in the United States -- right on target with treaty requirements. It did not disrupt the economy, cost jobs or deny consumers.\``People said it couldn't be done. They said it would be too costly. They said we couldn't ever replace these chemicals,'' said Elizabeth Cook, senior associate at the World Resources Institute.\``Well it's been done, and it's been done successfully.''"

TOKYO -- Two centuries after the dawn of the industrial age, the world today takes its first concerted step to roll back the emission of ""greenhouse gases"" believed linked to climate change with the enactment of the Kyoto global-warming pact.
\
The agreement, negotiated in Japan's ancient capital of Kyoto in 1997 and ratified by 140 nations, calls on 35 industrialized countries to rein in the release of carbon dioxide and five other gases from the burning of oil and coal and other processes.
\
Its impact, however, will be limited by the absence of the United States, the world's leader in greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Proponents say the stakes are high: the gases are believed to trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to rising global temperatures that are melting glaciers, raising ocean levels and threatening dramatic and potentially damaging climate change in the future.
\
""The tools for keeping climate change under control, such as renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures, are developed and ready to use,"" said Greenpeace International official Stephanie Tunmore. ""There is now a price on climate pollution and penalties for polluters. The switch to a carbon economy begins here.""
\
Implementation of the agreement was delayed by a struggle to meet the requirement that countries accounting for 55 percent of the world's emissions ratify it. That goal was reached last year -- nearly seven years after the pact had been negotiated -- with Russia's approval.
\
The Clinton administration signed the protocol in 1997, but the U.S. Senate refused to ratify it, citing potential damage to the U.S. economy and insisting that it also cover countries with fast- growing economies such as China and India.
\
""We have been calling on the United States to join. But the country that is the world's biggest emitter has not joined yet, and that is regrettable,"" Japan's top government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroyuki Hosoda, told reporters.
\
In Japan, the host to the 1997 conference and a tireless supporter of the pact, the enactment -- at midnight New York time -- was being met with a mixture of pride and mounting worry that the world's second-largest economy is unprepared to meet its emission reduction targets.
\
Under Kyoto, the targets vary by region: The European Union is committed to cutting emissions to 8 percent below 1990 levels by 2012; the United States agreed to a 7 percent reduction before President Bush denounced the pact in 2001.
\
The White House has contended that complying with the treaty's requirement could cost millions of jobs, many of them to places like India and China, both signers of Kyoto but exempted from any limits on greenhouse gases.
\
""We are still learning about the science of climate change,"" White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Tuesday. In the meantime, McClellan said, ""We have made an unprecedented commitment to reduce the growth of greenhouse gas emissions in a way that continues to grow our economy.""
\
Elsewhere, officials made solemn pledges Tuesday to fulfill Japan's requirement under the treaty to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases by 6 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.
\
""Although the hurdle is high, we ask the Japanese people, including industries, for their cooperation,"" said Environment Minister Yuriko Koike.
\
The concerns are many. The Japanese government says many industries will need quick action to meet the goals, studies show much of the country is behind on implementation, and critics say Japan lacks a coherent climate-change policy.
\
Japan had an elaborate celebration planned for the enactment of the agreement on Wednesday at the convention hall where it was negotiated in December 1997.
\
A series of speeches and a panel discussion was planned with environmental officials, experts and activists, as well as 2004 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai of Kenya. The festivities were featuring messages from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and environmental officials around the world.
\
As the agreement comes into force, Japan is scrambling to put together a strategy to make sure it meets its obligations. Some officials are pondering a ""carbon tax"" to punish polluters -- a move opposed by business -- while others favor expansion of nuclear power and promotion of energy-saving technologies.
\
Tetsunari Ida, executive director of Tokyo's International Sustainable Energy Policy Institute, said the effort was suffering from a lack of coordination between the Environmental Ministry and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, or METI.
\
""Those two ministries are taking two separate climate change strategies,"" Ida said.
\
A METI report this month showed that 11 of 30 top industries -- steel and power among them -- risked failing to meet targets without quick action. Thirteen others had already cleared preliminary goals and were expected to meet the goals, the report said.
\
One area where Japan has been especially active is carbon trading -- a system under which governments have allocated carbon dioxide quotas to industrial facilities. Those which emit less gas than allowed can sell the ""credit"" to other companies who emit too much.
\
Makoto Katagiri, whose Natsource Japan is acting as a credit broker between Japanese and foreign companies, estimated in a study for the World Bank that Japan bought 41 percent of the carbon credits on the international market last year.
\
""From this figure, you can imagine how serious the Japanese companies (are),"" Katagiri said.

151,"It may seem as though Ben McAdams has been running for Congress against U.S. Rep. Mia Love, but the Democratic Salt Lake County mayor first must clear the field of three challengers within his own party hoping for a spot in the race.\It might also feel as if there’s been an ongoing race between Democratic Salt Lake County Councilwoman Jenny Wilson and Republican Mitt Romney, but Wilson must beat three fellow Democrats at the party’s state convention on Saturday or in a primary: Larry Livingston of Bountiful, Mitchell Vice of Salt Lake City and Jeff Dransfield of Logan.\Democrats will meet at the Salt Palace and decide if they’ll send McAdams and Wilson off to the races or give them another stop on the way, as hundreds of party delegates make their top picks in what will be the state’s biggest elections come November.\U.S. Senate: Republicans gave Romney his own primary challenge at their convention last weekend, setting up a June 26 showdown with state Rep. Mike Kennedy.\On the Democratic side, Wilson, a two-term councilmember, has pushed ethics reforms and open-space preservation. Wilson also championed the drive to extend health benefits to LGBT employees’ families.\Mitchell Vice is a self-described progressive who, on his website, said he “is seeking to challenge career politicians and carpet-bagging billionaires.” He views universal health care as a right, advocates passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and says that sexual orientation should be added to the Civil Rights Act.\Larry Livingston is a former IRS agent, former schoolteacher and onetime investment banker who has run for county commissioner and the Legislature multiple times. He says at one time or another he has been a Republican, Democrat and Libertarian and was once vice chairman of the Utah Libertarian Party.\Jeff Dransfield, of Logan, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\4th Congressional District: All candidates in the race not named Ben McAdams tout credentials as standard-bearers for the more-progressive, non-establishment wing of the party. All three are first-time candidates spurred to run by the same concerns that have prompted a wave of progressive-minded newcomers across the country to enter the political arena on the heels of Donald Trump’s surprise 2016 presidential victory.\Each says the Democratic nominee in the race should run true to party principle, not as a moderate alternative trying to appeal to Republicans estranged from their own party. Two of them started running more than a year ago.\Sheldon Kirkham, 40, a postal service employee from Taylorsville, grew up in southeastern Utah and graduated from the University of Utah with a political science degree. He announced plans to run in February and says he wants to “confront the influence of the donor class inside the Democratic party.”\Kirkham said he’s focused on national policy more than local or state-level affairs and believes someone from the party’s left wing needed to run in the race to “challenge the presumptive nominee.” He said he was “deeply concerned” about McAdams’ chances to unseat Love if he employs the same middle-road strategy that has led to Democratic losses nationally for years.\“There’s a path to victory, and it isn’t working around the margins to try to get a few disaffected Republicans to vote for the Democrats,” he said. The nominee should “take a strong message of reform directly to the unaffiliated electorate to convince them to support the Democrat.”\Darlene McDonald, 50, of Millcreek, is a technology analyst and project lead for Oracle who has lived in the city for 15 years. Originally from Cincinnati, she announced her plans to run a year ago, drawn to the race by Republican animus toward the Affordable Care Act and by her concerns about immigration, education and environmental policy.\As a young mother in her 20s, McDonald lost a young son who had been born with health issues. The family was able to enjoy a better quality of life with him because of her workplace insurance and Medicaid, and the prospect of other families managing similar challenges without a health-care safety net prompted her to run.\“I cannot be silent about this anymore,” she said of her decision. “I’m the progressive candidate in this race. It’s not that we can’t win. We can win if we run a progressive candidate that can tap into our Democratic base.”\Another Millcreek resident, Tom Taylor,33, is an engineering contractor with a Ph.D. in robotics engineering who filed to run on Tax Day last year — a nod to his concerns about the country’s “wealth inequality crisis.” He sees an “urgent deadline” for dealing with climate change — he wants a carbon tax and subsidies for green-energy technologies — and supports a “Medicare for All” system of health care.\Taylor said Utah Democrats lose elections when they run “so-called moderates”— candidates who embrace liberal positions on some issues, such as climate change and the environment, but conservative positions on others, such as tax and social policy. The district’s voter makeup, he said, favors the right kind of Democrat.\“Democrats for a long time here in this state have tried to run candidates that basically don’t stand up for anything,” Taylor said. “The key here is to make the case to the delegates that not only can a real Democrat win here in this district, but someone who is a real Democrat, that doesn’t shy away from values and boldly proclaims those things, actually has a better shot in the general election than the candidates that we’ve been running for a long time.”\There are two Democrats in each of the remaining districts, all held by Republicans.\1st Congressional District: Kurt Weiland, a business consultant, is running against Lee Castillo, a social worker, for the right to face U.S. Rep. Rob Bishop, a Republican serving his eighth term representing the northern Utah district.\2nd Congressional District: What historically had been a toss-up seat long held by both Republicans and Democrats has become safely Republican, held by Rep. Chris Stewart since it was created after redistricting in 2012. Two progressive Democrats are running to unseat Stewart.\Shireen Ghorbani of Salt Lake City and Randy Hopkins of Farmington both said they would support federal land and work to keep it public.\“Many Utahns feel unrepresented,” said Ghorbani, who said she got in the race after continued attacks on the Affordable Care Act by Stewart and other Republicans. “Our representatives are out of touch with our values.”\3rd Congressional District: Two Democrats are hoping to run for the seat held by Rep. John Curtis – who has his own primary battle.\James Singer is a Navajo and Mormon living in West Valley City. Singer had announced a run for the U.S. Senate before backing off, saying he couldn’t contend with Sen. Orrin Hatch’s $3.5 million campaign war chest. Hatch since announced his retirement.\Kent Moon, of Cottonwood Heights, formerly worked in financing for the U.S. Small Business Association. He says, “You simply cannot get further from Utah Values than Donald Trump.”\Three contested, rural legislative races: Six Democrats are looking to run in sweeping, rural districts that each include portions of liberal havens.\Senate District 26, which includes the oil country of northeast Utah plus Park City, has attracted Republicans and Democrats looking to replace outgoing Sen. Kevin Van Tassell, R-Vernal. Democrats Eileen Gallagher, a Park City pediatrician, and Pat Vaughn, who lives in Midway, are running for the spot.\Two Democrats are running for another district that includes rural towns and also Park City. Park City residents Meaghan Miller and Roberto Lopez are hoping delegates pick them on Saturday for House District 54, currently held by Republican Tim Quinn, of Heber.\House District 69, which runs from Duchesne County to Grand County, attracted Democrats Tim Glenn, of Green River, and Danielle Howa Pendergrass, of Price. The seat is held by Republican Rep. Christine Watkins, R-Price, who faces a primary runoff with Carbon County Commissioner Jae Potter.\Credit: By Bill Dentzer"
152,"I was a socialist in college. I read magazines like The Nation and old issues of The New Masses. I dreamed of being the next Clifford Odets, a lefty playwright who was always trying to raise proletarian class consciousness. If you go on YouTube and search “David Brooks Milton Friedman,” you can see a 22-year-old socialist me debating the great economist. I’m the one with the bushy hair and the giant 1980s glasses that were apparently on loan from the Palomar lunar observatory.\The best version of socialism is defined by Michael Walzer’s phrase, “what touches all should be decided by all.” The great economic enterprises should be owned by all of us in common. Decisions should be based on what benefits all, not the maximization of profit.\That’s not what “democratic socialists” like Bernie Sanders are talking about, but I get why some of their socialist concerns are popular. Why do we have to live with such poverty and inequality? Why can’t we put people over profits? What is the best life in the most just society? Socialism is the most compelling secular religion of all time. It gives you an egalitarian ideal to sacrifice and live for.\My socialist sympathies didn’t survive long once I became a journalist. I quickly noticed that the government officials I was covering were not capable of planning the society they hoped to create. It wasn’t because they were bad or stupid. The world is just too complicated.\I came to realize that capitalism is really good at doing the one thing socialism is really bad at: creating a learning process to help people figure stuff out. If you want to run a rental car company, capitalism has a whole bevy of market and price signals and feedback loops that tell you what kind of cars people want to rent, where to put your locations, how many cars to order. It has a competitive profit-driven process to motivate you to learn and innovate, every single day.\Socialist planned economies — the common ownership of the means of production — interfere with price and other market signals in a million ways. They suppress or eliminate profit motives that drive people to learn and improve.\It doesn’t matter how big your computers are, the socialist can never gather all relevant data, can never construct the right feedback loops. The state cannot even see the local, irregular, context-driven factors that can have exponential effects. The state cannot predict people’s desires, which sometimes change on a whim. Capitalism creates a relentless learning system. Socialism doesn’t.\The sorts of knowledge that capitalism produces are often not profound, like how to design the best headphone. But that kind of knowledge does produce enormous wealth. Human living standards were pretty much flat for all of human history until capitalism kicked in. Since then, the number of goods and services available to average people has risen by up to 10,000%.\If you’ve been around a little while, you’ve noticed that capitalism has brought about the greatest reduction of poverty in human history. In 1981, 42% of the world lived in extreme poverty. Now, it’s around 10%. More than 1 billion people have been lifted out of poverty.\You’ve noticed that places that instituted market reforms, like South Korea and Deng Xiaoping’s China, tended to get richer and prouder. Places that moved toward socialism — Britain in the 1970s, Venezuela more recently — tended to get poorer and more miserable.\You’ve noticed that the environment is much better in capitalist nations than in planned economies. The American GDP has more than doubled since 1970, but energy consumption has risen only modestly. America’s per-capita carbon emissions hit a 67-year low in 2017. The greatest environmental degradations are committed by planned systems like the old Soviet Union and communist China.\The Fraser Institute is a free-market think tank that ranks nations according to things free-market think tanks like: less regulation, free trade, secure property rights. The freest economies in the world are places like Hong Kong, the U.S., Canada, Ireland, Latvia, Denmark, Mauritius, Malta and Finland. Nations in the top quartile for economic freedom have an average GDP per capita of $36,770. For those in the bottom quartile, it’s $6,140. People in the free economies have a life expectancy of 79.4 years. Those in the planned economies have a life expectancy of 65.2 years.\Over the past century, planned economies have produced an enormous amount of poverty and scarcity. What’s worse is what happens when the political elites learn what you can do with that scarcity. They turn scarcity into corruption. When things are scarce, you have to bribe government officials to get them. Soon, everybody is bribing. Citizens soon realize the whole system is a fraud. Socialism produces economic and political inequality as the rulers turn into gangsters. A system that begins in high idealism ends in corruption, dishonesty, oppression and distrust.\I learned the ills of socialism quickly ... and became a Whig slowly.\My first economic hero is Alexander Hamilton. He came to America with almost nothing and found an economy dominated by land-rich oligarchs like Thomas Jefferson. He realized that the solution was to make everyone a capitalist. He created credit markets so that capital would be fluid and more people would have access to investments.\My next hero is Abraham Lincoln. He grew up poor and launched his career as a Whig. He gave more speeches on banking and infrastructure projects than on slavery. That’s because he wanted to spread capital and grease the wheels of commerce so poor boys and girls like him could rise. He helped create the land-grant colleges so that more people would have the training to compete as capitalists.\Another major American figure in the Whig tradition is Theodore Roosevelt. He loved the dynamism that capitalism arouses and knew that sometimes you have to limit giant corporations so millions of less established capitalists can compete.\All of these leaders understood that the answer to the problems of capitalism is wider and fairer capitalism.\Today, parts of our capitalist system in the United States are in good shape. Growth is remarkably steady, inflation is low, employment is high, wages for the poorest Americans are rising twice as fast as for high-wage workers.\But capitalism, like all human systems, is always unbalanced one way or another. Over the last generation, capitalism has produced the greatest reduction in global income inequality in history. The downside is that low-skill workers in the U.S. are now competing with workers in Vietnam, India and Malaysia. The reduction of inequality among nations has led to the increase of inequality within rich nations, like the United States.\Also, education levels have not kept pace with technology. More people grow up with inadequate schools, disrupted families and fragmented neighborhoods. They find it harder to acquire the skills to become good capitalists. The market is effectively closed off to them.\These problems are not signs that capitalism is broken. They are signs that we need more and better capitalism. We need a massive infusion of money and reform into our education systems, from infancy through life. Human capital-building is like nutrition: It’s something you have to attend to every day. We need welfare programs that not only subsidize poor people’s consumption but also subsidize their capacity to produce.\We need worker co-ops, which build skills and represent labor at the negotiating table. We need wage subsidies and mobility subsidies, so people can afford to move to opportunity. We need tax subsidies for health care, to make it easier for people to switch jobs. We need a higher earned-income tax credit, to give the working poor financial security so they don’t get swept away amid the creative destruction. We need a carbon tax, to give everyone an incentive to reduce carbon emissions without pretending we know the best way to do it.\Every single idea I just mentioned comes from the American Enterprise Institute or Brookings or some other institution derided as being part of the neoliberal elite. All these ideas would make capitalism work better.\A big mistake those of us on the conservative side made was to think that anything that made the government bigger also made the market less dynamic. We failed to distinguish between the supportive state and the regulatory state. The supportive state makes better and more secure capitalists. The Scandinavian nations have very supportive welfare states. They also have very free markets. The only reason they can afford to have generous welfare states is they also have very free markets.\I don’t know if the Scandinavian welfare model would work in nations as big and diverse as the U.S. But its success points to a few truths: The state nurtures prosperity when it helps people become capitalists. The state causes incredible levels of misery when it gets too far inside the decision-making processes of capitalists. It creates enormous misery when it cripples the motivational system that drives capitalism. Its causes enormous misery when it meddles with the relentless learning system that market mechanisms make possible.\Capitalism is not a religion. It won’t save your soul or fulfill the yearnings of your heart. But somehow it will arouse your energies, it will lift your sights, it will put you on a lifelong learning journey to know, to improve, to dare and to dare again.\Last Sunday I attended a service with a young friend at a church that has quickly become a home for her. There were several hundred congregants — 90% were under 30; 90% percent were Latino. The service was two hours of joy and exultation — glow sticks and song and balloons.\They weren’t worshipping capitalism, but something higher. But still their work lives came into view. “Look how far we’ve come! Look how far we’ve come!” different people kept saying. I saw my own family’s Jewish immigration history being re-enacted right in front of me. We, like they, started out as butchers and seamstresses and tailors, self-employed capitalists because it can be hard for immigrants to get corporate jobs. The opportunity explosion my family experienced and your family probably experienced is happening still, made possible by the ever-expanding pie that capitalism provides.\The theme that day was hope, transcendent hope and more immediate hope. “Move and miracles happen!” a young Latino woman sang. Every year, hundreds of millions of people march with their feet to capitalism.\Today, the real argument is not between capitalism and socialism. We ran that social experiment for 100 years and capitalism won. It’s between a version of democratic capitalism, found in the U.S., Canada and Denmark, and forms of authoritarian capitalism, found in China and Russia. Our job is to make it the widest and fairest version of capitalism it can possibly be.\David Brooks is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.\Crédito: By David Brooks | The New York Times"

154," All of the recent talk from the state's policy-makers about the energy supply crises is missing a very important element: energy efficiency. Not conservation, which is occasionally mentioned, but energy efficiency. Not doing with less, but doing more with what we have. Not turning down the thermostat but making our houses, buildings and processes more efficient.\ Not sacrificing comfort and convenience, but increasing our productivity, improving our competitiveness, reducing financial risk and reducing our impacts on the environment. Rather than paying to dig a big hole in the ground, or drill a new well, then paying to cover them up 20 years later, investments in energy efficiency stay in the economy and can be reinvested again and again.\ Conservation is a short-term response and has limited long-term impact. Efficiency, on the other hand, results in long-term, continuously increasing benefits, only one of which is conservation of limited resources.\ Examples of increased energy efficiency include replacing traditional lights with compact fluorescent lights, using more energy- efficient motors on fans and pumps, using natural daylight as much as available and purchasing more efficient furnaces and washer and dryers.\ Increasing energy efficiency has the same impact on energy supply as building a new power plant, or drilling a new gas well, except it doesn't pollute the air or the water, or deplete finite resources.\ Higher energy efficiency increases productivity; it is infinitely renewable; it creates more, and better, jobs; and reduces the risk of future energy price increases.\ The benefits of energy efficiency as an energy resource are supported by years of experience and research. Energy efficiency programs throughout the country have repeatedly demonstrated these benefits. According to a report by the Rand Institute, California's early promotion of energy efficiency has added hundreds of dollars to the state's per-capita domestic product.\ In Colorado, regulators recently decided to significantly increase spending on energy efficiency (DSM or Demand Side Management), stating in their order: ""According to all the witnesses who testified at the hearing, DSM is the least expensive and easiest way to satisfy Colorado's growing demand for electricity.""\ A recent report by the Tellus Institute -- sponsored by PacifiCorp, the State Office of Energy and Resource Planning and Utah Industries of the Future -- estimates that the potential of cost- effective electric energy efficiency resources in Utah alone is equivalent to a good-sized coal-fired power plant. And all of this was before the recent dramatic rate increases in energy prices!\ There are many reasons energy efficiency hasn't received the attention it deserves: biased regulatory treatment and tax policies; split incentives where a party making the investment is not the one receiving the benefit; capital allocation failures where investments in energy efficiency may offer a superior return on investments but companies fail to act out of ignorance; imperfect price signals where consumers are shielded from the true costs of energy use and development; focus on first cost when lifetime energy costs may exceed total initial costs; outdated design and construction practices that fail to address life-cycle costs; reluctance to accept that mankind can, and is, changing our climate; the mistaken linkage of efficiency to a liberal agenda; overreliance on ""perfect"" markets, etc.\ The United States has one of the least energy-efficient economies in the developed world. When energy was cheap, perhaps this didn't matter. But energy isn't cheap anymore. In fact, many argue that energy has never been cheap but that the true costs have been shielded from consumers through subsidies and by pushing costs to future generations in the form of air and water pollution. Regardless, cheap energy is a thing of the past.\ Even if we are willing to sacrifice our environment and make our grandchildren pay the price, developing new energy resources will be expensive. For example, electric energy from a new coal-fired power plant could be three times as expensive as existing plants.\ Few doubt that government has a role to play in what our energy future looks like. State policy-makers and regulators can help overcome many of the barriers to increasing our efficiency, if they have the knowledge and will. Educated consumers -- local governments, school districts, private companies, individuals -- all stand to benefit by pushing policy-makers, regulators and utilities to aggressively promote increased energy efficiency. It is imperative that Gov. Mike Leavitt and the Legislature's energy policy task force seriously consider energy efficiency as a viable economic resource now, while attention is focused on the need for new energy resources.\ Call them and let them know that energy efficiency, not just conservation, must be an integral, perhaps a dominant, part of any comprehensive state or national energy policy. Relying solely on new supply-side resources will result in higher energy costs and will do nothing to reduce our exposure to future energy market disruptions.\ ------\ Mark E. Case, P.E., is the president of etc Group Inc., a Salt Lake City energy analysis and engineering firm dedicated to improving the energy efficiency of American industry and reducing the impacts of energy use on the environment."

That is enough natural gas to heat and fuel 21,000 residential homes for a year,"" said spokesman Darren Shepherd.\The American Council report noted that because of Questar efforts, Utah on a per-capita basis was the top state in the nation in terms of energy-efficiency program funding by natural gas utilities.\""We've also seen efforts by state government,"" said Kevin Emerson, senior policy and regulatory associate at Utah Clean Energy, an advocacy group promoting the use of renewable energy systems. The state is tracking energy use in its buildings and facilities, and formulating plans to reduce consumption. And unlike a lot of states, Utah routinely adopts the most updated energy conservation codes for commercial buildings, he said.\""What it comes down to is the cheapest energy is the energy that we don't use,""he said.

159,"Increasingly, there are two seasons along the Wasatch Front. The hazy days of winter, when inversion layers trap fine-particle pollution in the valleys and make our air so thick you can see it and feel it. And the lazy days of summer, when we're chased indoors by an invisible but unhealthy blanket of ozone, a mix of auto exhaust and noxious fumes baked under a blazing sun.\This year, the inversion layers came often and stayed late, while the ozone season arrived early. The Utah Division of Air Quality issued its first ozone alert last week. In other words, we've jumped out of the smoke and into the chemical stew.\Enough is enough. It has to stop. Public advocacy groups such as Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment and Utah Moms for Clean Air, demand it. The federal Environmental Protection Agency demands it. And, most importantly, our health demands it.\It's tough to blame ozone and fine-particle pollution problems on traditional industries, which are already cleaning up their acts. Experts agree that the cause is as close as the car in your driveway and the trucks on the highway. And the solution is as close as Capitol Hill.\The state Legislature, which too often considers ""environment"" a dirty word and treats the Utah Department of Environmental Quality like an ugly stepchild, will be asked to act next year. We hope it finds the courage.\Because our lawmakers refuse to adequately fund the DEQ, the agency has formed a task force of stakeholders to recommend how to raise $3 million per year for air quality improvement planning and implementation.\The money is needed for monitoring, scientific studies, and the drafting of a plan to eventually bring the state into compliance with new EPA regulations for fine-particle pollution and ozone. Results from 23 monitoring stations already indicate that the state exceeds these regulations along the Wasatch Front, and similar results are expected when new ozone standards are issued next year.\If the state fails to fall into line in time, it could forfeit federal transportation funding.\Because the majority of the pollutants flow from tailpipes, the task force will likely recommend higher fuel taxes, increased vehicle registration fees, an emissions tax based on vehicle age, or a combination of the three, all aimed at changing our polluting ways.\The taxes and fees will not be popular. But the Legislature, and the rest of us, will have to bite the bullet. Our health, our longevity, depend on it.\Credit: Tribune Editorial"
160,"ddemille@thespectrum.com\ST. GEORGE - With triple-degree temperatures and the coinciding air-conditioner use only a few months away, St. George is preparing for the increased energy needs with construction of a new natural gas generation turbine.\The second turbine at the Millcreek Generation Facility, estimated to cost about $47.5 million, is slated for a test run at the end of the month and would come online in early May. It would more than double the plant's current output of 40 megawatts, lessening the city's need to depend on power transmitted from coal-fired plants and improving the diversity of energy sources available for future power needs.\St. George is already unique in Utah, receiving only 45 percent of its power from coal. Roughly 12 percent comes from hydropower and renewable energy, with the remainder coming from natural gas. The new turbine will make gas the city's largest source of energy, at an estimated 48 percent.\With a statewide initiative in place to reduce dependence on coal and the likelihood of carbon-capping legislation at some point, the diverse resources give St. George an advantage for controlling costs in the future.\""Probably the best in the state,"" Gary Esplin, city manager, said of the city's energy options during a city council meeting last week. ""If we get the carbon emissions tax, we're not hit as hard as some other places.""\Energy companies are also awaiting the much-discussed carbon-capping legislation, which has been put somewhat on the back burner because of the health care debate. Whether natural gas is included in any such legislation, it should help the city to have as many options as possible, said Phillip Solomon, director of the Energy Services department.\In St. George especially, it is useful to have natural gas, which can be turned on and off with need. In winter months the city uses about 90 megawatts of capacity, but in summer months it can reach 180 megawatts. With natural gas, the city can essentially turn on the tap when necessary.\""Like anything, it's always good not to put all your eggs in one basket,"" Solomon said. ""Coal plants have to run 24/7, and we needed the peaking.""\The project is on schedule and about $2.5 million under the targeted cost, thanks to a favorable bidding environment, he said.\In addition, the energy should be cleaner than coal. Aside from a relatively average carbon dioxide emission rate of 1,000 pounds per megawatt, the new generator will have ""near zero"" emissions of other compounds thanks to $12 million worth of emissions controls such as chemical scrubbers, Solomon said.\""We're so minimal that we didn't spark a primary source review by air quality,"" he said.\Some environmental groups, including the Energy Justice Network, contend natural gas, while producing fewer emissions from a power plant, has its own serious environmental hazards because of the impacts of gas extraction and transmission. However, other groups have called gas-fired plants a preferable alternative to coal, especially as a peaking plant. Citizens for Dixie's Future, a local advocacy group, acknowledged that new natural gas-fired power plants would be needed to meet peak power demands, as did Utah Clean Energy, a statewide organization also pushing for clean air."

SALT LAKE CITY - The Utah branch of the NAACP is calling for ""just"" energy polices in the state, arguing that pollution is a civil rights issue that disproportionately impacts people of color.
\
""From the cradle to the grave, coal has proven to be unhealthy,"" said Jacqui Patterson, director of the NAACP's environmental and climate justice program.
\
The organization released policy recommendations, and in particular its Utah findings at a Tuesday news conference at the Utah State Bar Law and Justice Center.
\
In its national report, the organization said 68 percent of African-Americans live within 30 miles of a coal-fired power plant and that prolonged exposure to plant emissions is linked to birth defects, heart disease, asthma attacks, lung disease and learning difficulties.
\
While African-Americans are enduring a greater share of the negative impacts and spend a greater proportion of their income on energy - the outlay was $41 billion in 2009 - the report said few benefits are being realized. African-Americans held only 1.1 percent of energy jobs and only gained 0.01 percent of the revenue from energy sector profits.
\
Jeanetta Williams, president of the NAACP's Utah State Conference, said the group sees not only a chance for improved health with energy policy shifts, but also a chance for economic opportunity in a clean energy economy, especially in Utah with its great solar resource, for example.
\
""At a time when there is growing recognition that Utah is at the nexus between polluting energy production processes and climate change impacts, the NAACP is compelled to advance a justice and equity-based analysis of our energy choices and effects on community well-being, and the environment on which we all rely for our existence,"" she said in a prepared statement.
\
The national organization estimates that if electric utilities met 20 percent of their sales with renewable energy by 2020, 1.9 million jobs would result.
\
That type of economic boost could help to transform low-income neighborhoods and communities of color if the right kind of policies were in place, according to the report.
\
The three Utah-specific recommendations advanced by the NAACP are:
\
* Utah should show leadership by shifting from a voluntary renewable energy standard of 20 percent by 2025 to a mandatory standard of 25 percent. Twenty-nine states plus the District of Columbia have mandatory standards in place, which require a particular percentage of their energy come from an alternative to fossil fuels.
\
* Utah should implement a mandatory energy efficiency standard that requires a 2 percent annual reduction in each previous year's retail electricity sales. States that have such a requirement at 2 percent include Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, New York and Vermont.
\
* Utah should adopt a local hire provision that encompasses energy projects. Local Hire is a goal or requirement to hire people who live near their place of work. States achieve the goal by requiring contractors on publicly funded projects to recruit local residents or workers, boosting local economies and reducing the environmental impact of commuting.
\
The report brought praise from a solar energy advocacy organization called UCARE.
\
""The NAACP is right: energy issues are human rights issues. The social costs of carbon have been ignored far too long. As the group's report clearly states, health costs associated with fossil fuel pollution hurt everyone, but place an even greater burden on poor families,"" said Stan Holmes, the group's community outreach coordinator. ""Advocates for social justice should follow the NAACP's lead and press Utah political and business leaders for clean energy policies.""
\
Williams said the group plans to pursue its recommendations with lawmakers and has not ruled out weighing in on the Utah Public Service Commission's pending cost-benefit analysis of solar energy.

162,"After building 20,000 homes in 31 years, you’d think Ivory Homes would have settled on its approach.\But as Utah’s largest homebuilder marked the construction milestone Thursday with a celebration for Ivory Homes’ employees, its CEO promised new strategies to make future dwellings more affordable, energy efficient and kinder to the environment.\“We understand that if we do our job right,"" Clark Ivory said, “we will create neighborhoods and communities that will appreciate in value and be sustainable over the long term.”\Ivory said the Murray-based company would double the number of homes it is setting aside for workforce housing, expanding to 200 newly built dwellings per year reserved at affordable prices for purchase by teachers, nurses, veterans, police officers, first-time buyers and those working in Utah’s construction trades.\Announced in February, the company’s initial workforce housing set-asides centered in Utah County will now be available in Salt Lake and Weber counties, with homes in Magna and West Haven, a company spokesman said.\And while other homebuilders and some Utah cities have similar initiatives to get workers into homes, Ivory Homes is notable as an industry influencer as it continues to focus on several housing affordability and green issues in residential construction.\Derek Miller, president and CEO of the Salt Lake Chamber, called Ivory Homes’ 20,000 home milestone “a remarkable achievement.” He said the company has been pivotal in working with business leaders to address Utah’s housing shortage.\Population growth continues to strain Utah’s housing supplies, driving up prices and rents even as thousands of new dwellings come on line. By leading economic estimates, the state is thought to lack more than 40,000 single-family homes and rental units affordable to households earning at or below the region’s average incomes.\“This situation affects all of us, every industry, every profession, every individual and, of course, our employees,” Miller said. “It will also affect our children and our grandchildren.”\Gov. Gary Herbert encouraged other builders to follow Ivory Homes’ lead, saying the company’s efforts over the decades had helped deliver the benefits of owning a home to enough families to fill communities such as Layton or St. George.\“I’m a big believer in homeownership and that people ought to be buying instead of renting,” said Herbert, a former real estate broker and developer.\Roughly 70% of Utahns own their homes as opposed to renting, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That ratio currently stands far lower at 44.7% for Salt Lake City, with 55.3% of residents renting their home.\Utah’s overall share of owner-occupied households, Herbert noted, remains high compared to other U.S. states and the country as a whole, which currently stands at about 64.8% homeowners.\In addition to making neighborhoods more stable, boosting community involvement and helping owners accumulate wealth, the Republican governor said, “private real estate ownership is the foundation for freedom and liberty in our country.”\Ivory Homes also announced plans Thursday to equip all its future homes with garage outlets suitable for electric-vehicle charging stations beginning next year. Homebuyers also can get a discount on charging station installation fees through a new partnership with Rocky Mountain Power called ""EV-Ready Homes.”\In a statement, a representative from the Utah Clean Air Partnership praised the program as a “practical solution” aimed at improving the state’s air quality by helping to put a greater number of less-polluting electric cars on the road.\Ivory Homes is partway into a campaign to plant 30,000 trees statewide as part of a separate clean-air initiative.\The homebuilder is raising the average energy-efficiency standard for its homes, Ivory said. The company also said it will make water-wise landscaping a standard feature for its new construction, with the potential to slash water usage for an average home by two-thirds.\Crédito: By Tony Semerad"

Not long ago, a gallon of gasoline cost mroe than $3.80. It has now fallen to less than $2 in many areas. Few saw such a decline coming, but it creates an intriguing opportunity to take action on climate change as well as address transportation needs that depend heavily on gas taxes.
\
Despite the plummeting price of oil and gasoline, most elected officials are loath to raise the gas tax and invite public displeasure. Yet many also recognize the need to supplement falling revenues from current gas taxes and to reduce risks from climate change.
\
The current federal gas tax of 18.4 cents a gallon was set in 1993. Congress failed to index it to inflation, so revenue was destined to decline even as transportation maintenance needs grew. States gas taxes also are fairly low, averaging about 31 cents a gallon.
\
Revenues from gas taxes fell as people drove less and used more fuel-efficient vehicles. The high cost of gasoline encouraged these desirable trends, but that also meant less money for transportation infrastructure repairs.
\
Vehicle fuel efficiency is slated to increase more over the next decade, which is great news. Yet the change will further erode transportation revenue.
\
California's experience suggests what might be done. The state leads the nation in taking climate change seriously and in promoting alternatives to fossil fuels.
\
Burning those fuels in our cars, trucks, and planes is responsible for 28 percent of the country's greenhouse gas releases. Just recently, Governor Brown proposed striking new goals: cutting in half the state's use of fossil fuels in vehicles and in 15 years generating half of the state's electricity from renewable sources.
\
The component of California's policy that other states should consider is its cap-and-trade program that puts a price on use of carbon-based fuels. The state just extended it to transportation fuels. In effect, beginning on January 1 of this year, California raised its gas tax by an estimated 10 cents a gallon.
\
A carbon or greenhouse gas tax like this can be designed for different purposes. Government could add the tax to all fossil fuels, as California has done, thereby raising their price to reflect at least some of the social costs of using them, such as impacts on climate change, the environment and public health that gas prices do not now include.
\
Over time, the higher price should discourage use of fossil fuels, promote a search for alternatives and stimulate energy efficiency while also improving air quality and public health. Such a market-based policy might even appeal to political conservatives who prefer market solutions to government regulation.
\
Because the higher cost for energy can be a serious burden on many citizens, other taxes could be lowered by the same amount. That is, there need be no net increase in taxes, only a shift of taxes to carbon releases.
\
The Citizens Climate Lobby has proposed such a revenue-neutral carbon tax, which it calls a carbon fee and dividend system in which all the fees collected are returned to households as a dividend to help pay for the increased cost of fossil fuels.
\
One recent study found that the plan could reduce carbon emissions sharply, create millions of jobs, and greatly improve air quality and public health.
\
Variations on such a policy might hold even more appeal for some policymakers and the public. These include dedication of some portion of the fees to highways, mass transit, research on energy technologies or other policy goals.
\
Low gasoline prices will not last. If we're smart, we'll take advantage of current prices to build public support for increasing the gas tax and pegging it to inflation. Even better, states could enact revenue-neutral carbon taxes on all fossil fuels to help combat climate change. California shows that it can be done.

\
The most preposterous thing about a carbon tax, which California is in the process of implementing under the guise of a cap-and-trade program and which some other states are now considering, is the pretense that it will curb carbon emissions.
\
This notion - the idea that states can save the planet from getting too hot - is great soap opera, but it is just a way to bring more revenue to state governments regardless of its stated intent.
\
Whether it's called cap-and-trade or a carbon tax, California is now stuck with a fee on the carbon content of fuels. It's the first of its kind in the United States, but environmental groups are urging other states to do the same.
\
The California Air Resources Board, whose goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, claims the tax is a cost for oil refineries. But that's disingenuous.
\
Oil companies will simply pass the carbon tax along to California consumers in the form of higher prices. Experts estimate that the tax - which took effect at the start of this year - has the potential to increase gasoline prices by as much as 75 cents per gallon.
\
Guess who would pay the bill for the carbon tax? A carbon tax would disproportionately impact those who are most vulnerable in our economy - low-and-middle class families and small businesses. It would be foolish to think otherwise.
\
Make no mistake, the tax on transportation fuels will push gas and diesel prices upward and burden drivers, businesses, and schools, effectively erasing the economic benefits that Californians currently enjoy at the pump.
\
Think about its impact: To save money, some drivers may fill up at service stations in neighboring states that don't have a carbon tax.
\
And companies might be tempted to relocate elsewhere in the country to save on energy costs. Other companies might have no choice but to shut down, resulting in a loss of jobs. States without a carbon tax would gain economically at the expense of those with one.
\
In Vermont, a coalition of environmental groups has proposed a state tax of between $50 and $150 per ton of carbon emissions to be levied on businesses that distribute gasoline, heating oil, natural gas, propane and diesel. The groups claim the tax would produce $35 million in revenue by 2017 and as much as $700 million by 2030. Of the new revenues, 10 percent would automatically go to renewable energy companies.
\
State government is a great milieu for ""pass the buck"" politics, but carbon taxation is merely a way to reduce a staggering debt and reward political allies.
\
What someone like California Gov. Jerry Brown might not be able to achieve through tighter controls on spending, he can certainly gain by using public concern about climate change to ratchet up taxes. And you can be sure it won't stop at the gas pump.
\
The next target for carbon taxes could be electricity utilities and their customers. Environmentalists say it's no big deal. But fossil fuels account for about 60 percent of the nation's electricity supplies.
\
The irony is that the largest U.S. environmental groups oppose nuclear power, arguably the most important energy source in the battle against global warming.
\
The U.S. fleet of 100 nuclear plants accounts for nearly two-thirds of the nation's zero-carbon energy. But environmentalists don't recognize nuclear power's environmental value or its critically important role in maintaining a diverse mix of energy sources for reliable electricity.
\
To my mind, the path forward begins with environmentalists recognizing the importance of keeping existing nuclear plants in operation and realizing that nuclear power can collaborate well with other forms of emission-free energy such as solar and wind. If something better comes along, fine.
\
But carbon taxes should be the last resort - they won't help the environment much, they'll expand the size of government, and they'll damage the economy.

"
164," LONG ISLAND -- The American Petroleum Institute, which opposes it, says that the proposed energy tax comes to $33 billion a year, not $22 billion as the Treasury claims, and that it will raise gasoline prices by 10 cents a gallon, not the 7 1/2 cents the Treasury estimates.\ Too bad. I guess we'll just have to junk the entire Clinton economic program. With a flaw as fatal as this one combined with all the other little chinks being exposed, it's a wonder the plan has generated as much initial public support as it has.\ When Americans learn of the API figures, which some independent energy experts agree with, surely they will be willing to go to the barricades over this 2 1/2 cents and sink the whole program. And any hope of taming the budget deficit in this century will be the victim of the sort of arithmetical political bickering that suggests we are a backward people haggling over the price of a few beads in some bazaar.\ But wait. If the folks at API are right, and who am I to say they're biased, isn't this a good thing? The way I look at it, they're saying the energy tax is a 50% more efficient method of reducing the deficit than we ever dreamed. Whose side are they on?\ And who really imagines that Americans are prepared to sell out the fiscal interest of the nation for 2 1/2 cents or even 10 cents. I suspect most of us have a much higher price. And what does the API imagine is the difference between a 10 cent rise in gasoline prices caused by a tax increase and a 10 cent rise caused by market forces, wars and Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries conspiracies to limit production, such as it did occur between 1989 and 1991?\ I'll tell you the difference. One can be used to reduce the deficit and immunize little children. The other goes to build palaces in the Persian Gulf or to the fur department at Neiman Marcus or wherever else the owners of the world's oil reserves prefer to shop. This oversimplifies it, of course.\ But the drift is that the energy tax would cause a relatively small change in energy prices and add a relatively small burden to American households compared with the brutal swings in prices which various market forces have pressed onto them without their consent or a vote of their Congress in the past 20 years.\ Most of us are not so young and not so stupid that we can't remember when gasoline cost 38 cents a gallon. It was 1973.\ And suppose the API is wrong and the energy tax brings in $50 billion? I tell you what it would mean. We'd have an even lower deficit and our gasoline prices would still be less than half what they pay in Japan, Germany or any other industrial country you can name.\ We'd still be driving around more cheaply, devoting a smaller percentage of disposable incomes to energy than almost any people on Earth excepting those tribal areas of central Asia where the chief household fuel is still Camel dung. And after you've said all this for the energy tax, you haven't even touched on the real reason for it.\ It encourages conservation. This in turn improves the environment, lowers dependency on foreign oil, enhances the national security, lowers the trade deficit and, by lowering demand, preempts for the Treasury, our Treasury, price increases which otherwise could be forced down our throats any time not by a vote of our Congress but by a simple vote of the OPEC oil ministers. What else do you want to know about the energy tax?"
165,"CEDAR CITY -- Fuel-efficient vehicles, including hybrids and natural gas vehicles, help reduce pollution and can save drivers money at the pump -- but they are also causing a nationwide concern as state governments attempt to make up for lost gas tax revenue.\""The fuel efficiency of cars does affect the gas tax,"" said Kevin Kitchen, public information officer for the Utah Department of Transportation. ""That's a trend that's been verified nationwide.""\Several studies, including one from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, shows America's appetite for oil waning. Since a peak demand in 2007, demand of oil in America has been steadily and dramatically declining, with an expected continual drop of at least 7 percent over the next quarter century. While various factors can be attributed to this phenomena -- including an aging population that is driving less -- the main factor is that vehicles are becoming more fuel efficient.\According to J.P. Powers and Associates, fuel efficiency is the number one factor people take into consideration when purchasing a vehicle.\That was certainly the case for Enoch resident Morgan Ritter, who recently purchased a new Volkswagen Golf, which boasts 42 highway miles per gallon.\""I don't need a lot of space or hauling capabilities; I need to save money,"" Ritter said.\Others, like Cedar City resident Ryan Gunn, utilize natural gas vehicles. Gunn has a custom-built Chevrolet heavy-duty van he uses as a camper. Gunn can switch back and forth between natural gas and gasoline.\""It gets about 12 miles to the gallon (on gasoline),"" Gunn said. ""It gets the equivalent of 25 or 26 miles per gallon (on natural gas). I was excited about getting it because it makes it affordable to drive something like that.""\The problem comes from the fact that revenue from the 24.5-cent state gasoline tax used for repairing and maintaining roads -- called the B and C fund -- has been dropping, along with gas purchases. That means less money for the roads. These funds are not used on new projects, but to maintain roads.\B and C road funds are collected by the state and distributed to counties and municipalities based on miles of road and population. In 2012, Utah spent $124 million for B and C road funds, of which approximately $1.5 million went to Iron County, $1.3 million went to Washington County and $1.5 million went to Garfield County.\With budgets shrinking, the state legislature is mulling ideas to raise more money for roads, including the possibility of a local option gas tax.\Iron County Commissioner Alma Adams said at Monday's county commission meeting that such a program would see counties and cities opting into a tax to the tune of 5 to 10 cents per gallon. If they opt in, they would get an additional 10 percent in funding while they would lose 20 percent of funding if they opt out.\Adams said the idea is still in preliminary phases and nothing has been decided yet.\""It's a dilemma. The gas tax isn't cutting it, but I don't think people want to hear about a gas tax increase,"" Adams said.\Ritter doesn't like the idea.\""What would be the point then? I didn't buy my car to save the environment; I bought it to save money. If they charge more for gas then what's the point?"" Ritter said.\County Commissioner Dale Brinkerhoff suggested that increasing the tax on natural gas vehicles could be a better alternative. Currently, natural gas is taxed at 8.5 cents per gallon as opposed to gasoline's 24.5 cents per gallon.\""I know we want to encourage people to use (natural gas vehicles) but they use the roads just like everyone else,"" Brinkerhoff said.\Gunn believes an increase in price at the pump for natural gas vehicles wouldn't make it worthwhile to own one, citing increased costs when it comes to initial purchase price, conversion prices and maintenance.\""Right now it costs less, but not by much,"" Gunn said. ""Without that lower price at the pump, it wouldn't be worth it.""\While the final solution may not be popular, Kitchen said something will need to happen to reverse the trend.\""We will do what the legislators tell us,"" Kitchen said. ""This is a problem every (department of transportation) across the country is facing."""

WASHINGTON -- A cash crunch is fast approaching for the government trust fund that pays to build and repair highways and bridges.
\
The federal tax on a gallon of gas has not risen in 14 years, and Congress is reluctant to increase it. People are demanding more fuel- efficient vehicles -- less gasoline used, fewer dollars for the fund.
\
States already are looking for other places to acquire road- building money -- toll road and consumption-based sales taxes, for example. They worry that the fund's looming shortage could hurt their efforts to address traffic congestion as well as environmental and safety problems caused by inadequate roads.
\
The situation can only get worse in 2009, when revenues for the Federal Highway Trust Fund begin falling short of planned federal spending.
\
The fund provides the overwhelming bulk of federal dollars spent on highways. It gets its money mainly from the 18.4 cents-a-gallon excise tax that drivers pay at the pump.
\
Self-service regular now tops $3 a gallon. There is concern the price will reach a price at which people will get serious about cutting back on driving -- sending less money into the fund. Fuel tax receipts did dip last summer when there was a spike in pump prices.
\
About 45 percent of all highway spending comes from the trust fund. With less money available from the fund, states must turn elsewhere for money to expand their highways and fill their potholes. That prospect is making lots of people unhappy.
\
-- Indiana, facing a $1.8 billion gap in money needed for road improvements, negotiated a $3.85 billion deal with an Australian- Spanish consortium to lease and operate the Indiana Turnpike for 75 years. Voters expressed their displeasure, electing Democrats to replace a Republican-run House that signed off on the deal.
\
-- In Florida, with federal aid declining, more than 90 percent of new roads since the early 1990s have been toll roads, state Transportation Department spokesman Dick Kane said.
\
-- Voters in Washington state approved a 14.5-cent increase in state gasoline taxes over a five-year period.
\
-- In California, voters decided to borrow the money, approving bond issues totaling $19.9 billion to be used for highway and transit projects over the next 10 years.
\
-- Georgia increased its construction program from $911 million to $2 billion, largely through a sales tax on gasoline that rises with fuel prices, unlike the frozen federal levy.
\
The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials says at least six states have adopted variable fuel taxes that are pegged to inflation.
\
-- Oregon is experimenting with a voluntary system where drivers pay a user fee based on miles driven rather than gas consumed. Some environmentalists say this approach negates the benefits of buying fuel-efficient cars.
\
-- Texas, Virginia and Minnesota are among states that have built or are building high-occupancy toll lanes where drivers can pay to have a congestion-free path before them.
\
With the population of Texas increasing by 1,000 people a day, ""we as a state don't really feel like we have an option to shelve projects or sit on our hands as the problems with the highway trust fund loom larger and come closer on the horizon,"" said Christopher Lippincott, a Texas Transportation Department spokesman.
\
Revenues from tolls, bonds, federal loans and local contributions allowed most of a new turnpike around Austin to be completed more than 20 years sooner than if the state had relied solely on state and federal taxes.
\
The Texas Legislature is trying to satisfy concerns of Gov. Rick Perry over a bill that includes a two-year freeze on most new privately financed toll roads. The freeze reflects opposition to the Trans Texas Corridor, a combined toll road and rail system from Mexico to the Oklahoma line.
\
Of the 18.4 cents a gallon in federal excise taxes, about 15.44 cents goes to the highway trust fund, 2.86 cents to mass transit programs and one-tenth of a cent to a leaking underground storage tank fund. The tax on diesel fuel is slightly higher.
\
Close to two-thirds of the trust fund's $40 billion in receipts last year came from the gasoline tax.
\
Gasoline was only 30 cents a gallon and the excise tax on it was just 3 cents in 1956 when Congress created the highway trust fund. As gasoline prices rose, so did the tax. But a tax-averse Congress has kept it at 18.4 cents a gallon since 1993, when gasoline prices were about $1.10 a gallon.
\
Two years ago, lawmakers proposed a 4-cent-per gallon boost in the fuel tax to finance a $375 billion highway bill. They backed off when President Bush pledged to veto any road legislation with a tax increase. In the end, the spending plan came to $286 billion.
\
At the end of 2000, the highway trust fund had a balance of almost $23 billion. By the end of 2006, that balance had fallen to $9 billion.
\
The Congressional Budget Office predicts the fund will run a deficit of $1.7 billion at the end of 2009 and $8.1 billion by the end of 2010, when the current highway program expires and Congress will write a new one.
\
""This crisis will be thrown in their lap right as they are rewriting the program,"" said Jeff Shoaf, senior executive director of Associated General Contractors of America.
\
Because investment in new projects is spread over a number of years, every dollar of shortfall translates into a $4 drop in highway spending, he said.
\
Thus in 2010, the government will have only $20 billion to invest on highways, half the current spending level and less than one- third of the $70 billion that Shoaf said is needed for real road improvements.
\
""A drastic cut in federal highway and transit funding will result unless Congress steps in,"" John Horsley, executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, said in a report.
\
Horsley's group said the fuel tax would have to be increased by 10 cents per gallon through 2015 to restore the purchasing power of the program.
\
The Senate Finance Committee is looking into temporary ways to refinance the trust fund, including redirecting some transportation- related taxes that now go into the government's general account and clamping down on gas tax fraud. A Transportation Department commission also plans to issue recommendations by the end of this year.
\
By the middle of the next decade, the highway trust fund will be providing $100 billion to $150 billion below real needs for building highways and bridges, predicted Rep. Peter DeFazio, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee on highways and transit.
\
""In the long run we've either got to admit we are going to underinvest and accept more gridlock and congestion"" or find new revenue sources, said DeFazio, D-Ore.
\
What is clear to him is that raising taxes of any kind for the highway trust fund is possible only if people are convinced that more spending will mean less congestion, safer roads and a cleaner environment.
\
The public will not support new taxes ""just to throw money in the maw of the federal government,"" DeFazio said.

167,"CEDAR CITY -- If some Utah senators have their way, the state would raise its gasoline tax for the first time in 17 years, a possibility that is closer to reality after the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee voted 6-0 last week to endorse the increase, sending it to the full senate.\Under the proposal put forward by Sen. John Valentine, R-Orem, gasoline taxes would stay the same for the first year, but as fuel prices increase in the future, taxes would also increase. The measure calls for a flat tax rate of approximately 14 cents per gallon, with the rest of the tax based on the previous year's gas prices. A provision in the bill mandates that the tax doesn't dip below 24.5 cents a gallon, regardless of how gas prices fluctuate.\The bill, SB 60, isn't the only one being proposed with the goal of finding more revenue for the state's transportation fund. With a projected shortfall, the Legislature has spent a year studying how to make up this money during the next 30 years. Sen. Evan Vickers R-Cedar City, who sat on the interim transportation committee last summer, said the Legislature is discussing four proposals, none of which he supports right now.\""I get that we need to find revenue for our roads. We do a good job of maintaining our major corridors like I-15, but our rural roads are deteriorating at a rapid pace,"" Vickers said. ""I just don't think this is the time to make this decision. I think we need to talk about the issue during this session and then come back next year with a solution.""\Part of the shortfall in the budget, Vickers said, comes as a result of residents driving less and purchasing more fuel-efficient vehicles. SB 139, sponsored by Sen. Wayne Harper, R-Taylorsville, would increase the registration fee on some vehicles powered by natural gas and electric. Vickers said Harper's theory is that owners of these vehicles do not pay as much gas tax as others, so the state should have a method of recouping these losses.\Cedar City resident Bryan Hyde, who owns a vehicle powered by natural gas, doesn't agree.\""Generally, we tax things we want to discourage, like cigarettes, and that's what this does. It punishes those people for using vehicles that burn cleaner and are better for the environment,"" he said.\With natural gas prices coming in around $1.68, Hyde argues that he still pays his share of taxes at the pump.\Another bill circulating around the Legislature is HB 135, sponsored by Rep. Johnny Anderson, R-Taylorsville. His bill would decrease the gas tax and replace it with a 0.21 percent increase in sales tax on all products, including food.\""This bill would affect low-income people, some of them who don't even drive,"" Vickers said.\The final proposal comes from a discussion the interim transportation committee had last summer, Vickers said. The proposal, which has not yet been formalized into a bill, recommends allowing counties to impose their own higher gas taxes and keep the money.\Vickers said all of the pieces of legislation are controversial and will require a great deal of compromise if they are to be passed this year.\""I'm having a hard time stomaching raising taxes,"" Vickers said.

171,"
For two weeks now I've been urging public officials to begin thinking creatively about how governments tax people in this state. Don't keep collecting money the same old way just because your parents and grandparents did it that way when they were in charge.
\
Well, the people of Oregon have caught some of that spirit. Unfortunately, they've also shown that in government, just as in cooking, changes to the recipe are not necessarily always good.
\
Beginning next year, 400 Oregon drivers will have their cars equipped with special global positioning satellite devices as part of a pilot project that could one day completely replace the gasoline tax. Every time they fill up with gas, the little devices will radio the car's mileage to a receiver that accesses a state- run database. The idea is that, if the program were up and running statewide, the drivers would pay tax on how many miles they have driven, not on how much gas they have consumed.
\
The reasoning behind this is simple. According to press reports, bureaucrats in Oregon fear that everyone will begin buying fuel- efficient cars and that eventually this will lead to a drop in revenue from the gas tax. This is kind of like the angst public officials often spout about how Internet sales are robbing local governments of sales taxes. Even in environment-conscious Oregon, officials don't expect this gas-tax crisis to hit until about 2014, but they are determined to get ahead of the curve.
\
OK, I'm all for keeping both hands on the wheel and studying the curves ahead, but let's peer through the windshield. This plan has some major potholes. These can be broken down into two categories: the philosophical and the practical. Let's take the philosophical first.
\
If my car is equipped with a government-monitored GPS system, that means someone in a darkened room in some corner of the state Capitol could easily know where I am at all times. Granted, this would come in handy when a teenage son or daughter asks to borrow the car for a short errand and then returns with a shrug three hours later. But on a day-to-day basis, I'd rather not have a big ball thousands of miles out in space tracking where I go. First, the Patriot Act allows government to keep track of the books I check out from the library, and now this? Throw in my local grocery store discount card, and it starts getting spooky. Pretty soon, George Orwell will be watching me through my television set.
\
According to an Associated Press report, Oregon's system eventually could be tweaked so as to encourage ""good"" behavior. If you drive during peak rush-hour periods, your tax would be higher than if you stay late at work and go home when it's dark. And that leads me to the practical problems.
\
The people behind this project already concede that taxes can be engineered to change behaviors. If Americans begin buying fuel- efficient cars because gasoline costs too much (and there is little evidence to suggest this is happening at the moment), then taxing them by the mile would work in the opposite direction. Why buy a small car when you're taxed as much as in an SUV? If the gas tax is removed, the advertised price of gas would drop considerably, which also could entice a mathematically challenged public to hang on to its SUV love affair.
\
The people behind Oregon's plan discount this. ""The price of gas is enough to be a disincentive to owning and driving an SUV,"" Oregon's administrator for the Federal Highway Administration was quoted as saying by the AP. Really? It hasn't been so far.
\
Still, on one level the underlying assumptions for this program make sense. It all has to do with fairness. The more you use the roads, the more you ought to pay for the upkeep of those roads. That's the same philosophy behind the head tax being proposed for funding Utah schools.
\
But fairness can be an elusive concept. Big commercial trucks already pay taxes based on miles traveled. But they also pay based on the weight of the loads they carry. A small car has less of an impact on asphalt than does a big one. Meanwhile, even non-drivers benefit from a healthy highway system, just as everyone benefits from good schools.
\
Don't be surprised if you hear more about the Oregon plan. A lot of other states are watching it with interest.
\
Yes, it is true that modern technology could help overhaul an outdated tax system, both in Utah and nationally. My suggestion, however, is to avoid the plans that threaten to intrude on privacy. It is indeed good to think out of the box, but not every box is bad.

172,"The air out there has gotten pretty bad, no matter how you look at it.\A polluted fog has blanketed northern Utah valleys for days.\And state and federal forecasters, whose health advisories have focused on ""sensitive"" people so far, now agree the air is ""unhealthy"" for everyone who is thinking about prolonged exercise outdoors.\Wednesday looks like the best chance for northern Utah to escape its dubious distinction as having the nation's worst air quality. That's when a storm is expected to lift the high-pressure lid off the valley bowls and stir in some clean air.\""We're somewhat at the mercy of the weather because of the nature of the mountains we live in,"" said Bo Call, director of air monitoring for the state.\On the EPA's AIRNow web page, a roundup of air quality nationwide, northern Utah counties topped the list of pollution hot spots during the weekend. On its Air Quality Index scale, this year's first episode of foul air is expected to worsen today.\Scott Jackson, of EPA's Denver office, said even with the recent high values of fine particulates -- the soot typically blamed for Utah's winter pollution episodes -- the air in Utah is not so bad that the agency has issued a ""don't go outside"" warning for Utahns.\""Our forecasts give them a heads-up,"" he said.\And the latest episode has been just that, an episode rather than a long-term trend.\For local activists, including the Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment, the pollution spike provides a backdrop to raise public awareness about a range of issues, including a new air-pollution permit for Kennecott Utah Copper's mines, new federal ozone standards, a Nevada water-rights dispute and efforts to shift gas-tax money toward public transit that would help take cars off the road.\""You have to wonder how bad do things have to get before people embrace change -- and by people, I mean the Legislature,"" said Brian Moench, president of Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment. ""We're of the position this is not acceptable.""\Moench said more scientific studies show PM 2.5 pollution affects everyone, not only those in the ""sensitive groups,"" the very young, the very old and people with heart and lung problems. He said real solutions to Utah's poor air-quality should not be restricted to wishing for better weather or driving into the mountains above the pollution. Real solutions will happen when people insist on better controls through state regulation, he said.\In addition, added Bryce Bird of the Utah Division of Air Quality, people can do their own part to protect the air.\The state lists 50 tips on its Choose Clean Air Web site. You can read them at http://www.cleanair.utah.gov fahys@sltrib.com\Pollution spikes\Air quality in five northern Utah counties has topped federalstandards since Saturday.

173,"HOUSTON - Don't expect motorists to sympathize, but Exxon Mobil Corp. says gasoline prices didn't do it any favors in the first quarter.\Still, the world's largest publicly traded oil company said Thursday it earned $10.9 billion to start 2008, the second-biggest U.S. quarterly profit ever.\As in the past, the extraordinary results from Exxon Mobil prompted critics to insist the company and other major oil producers were profiting at the expense of frustrated consumers, who are paying more than ever to drive. Indeed, retail gas prices on Thursday rose to a new high above $3.62 a gallon.\But because gasoline prices have not kept pace with oil's stunning ascent to triple digits, Exxon Mobil and other big oil companies have seen far lower margins from refining and selling gasoline and other petroleum products.\That's because Exxon Mobil and others don't produce enough oil to satisfy their refining operations, so they have to buy crude at market prices too.\Exxon Mobil said earnings at its refining and marketing arm were off 39 percent in the most recent quarter, one reason overall results fell well short of Wall Street's lofty forecasts.\Year over year, however, earnings for the Irving, Texas-based company rose 17 percent, lifted largely by record crude prices. The only higher total in a three-month period was the $11.7 billion Exxon Mobil posted in the final three months of 2007.\''In an environment of high commodity prices, Exxon Mobil's outstanding portfolio of integrated businesses performed well, allowing us to deliver record first-quarter results,'' Henry Hubble, the company's vice president of investor relations, said on a conference call.\Not everyone was celebrating, particularly given the sluggish economy and housing crisis.\''Oil companies are racking up obscene profits left and right while American families are stretched to the limit by skyrocketing gas prices,'' U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a statement. ''It's time for Big Oil to pay its fair share.'' He and New York's other senator, presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, have called for a windfall tax on oil companies. Clinton wants such a tax to pay for a proposed three-month suspension on the federal gas tax. Republican Sen. John McCain also supports the so-called gas-tax holiday, though he wouldn't place the burden on oil companies.\Credit: By John Porretto The Associated Press"
174,"The lack of a cohesive national energy policy coupled with $4-a-gallon gasoline has politicians scrambling for quick, cheap fixes. That is seldom a good thing.\This is especially true for public lands in states like Utah.\Rather than launching an all-out national effort to produce commercially viable vehicles that run on something other than oil or use less of this increasingly valuable resource, politicians such as President George Bush and Republican presidential nominee John McCain pander.\Proposed ""solutions"" such as offshore drilling, drilling in Alaska refuges, raping thousands of acres of Western lands containing oil shale, or eliminating the national gas tax might sound good to a public that grew up taking cheap energy for granted. Sadly, they simply won't work.\The world's growing demand for oil, coupled with dwindling supplies, will guarantee high prices until the United States and other world powers find alternative fuels to run vehicles needed to move people and products.\For outdoor-recreation enthusiasts, turning public lands into strip mines for oil shale and issuing more permits for drilling rigs and natural-gas wells without considering the long-term consequences could be disastrous.\Such developments can potentially close off some lands to such activities as hiking, mountain biking and ATV riding. They can drastically alter the migratory and breeding habitat needed by all kinds of wildlife. Oil-shale development will use so much water, there is potential of losing streams and reservoirs for fishing and boating.\And, in this environment, who would dare contemplate designating more wilderness? After all, doesn't wilderness ""lock up"" resources?\Yet doing that makes sense.\I like the idea that millions of tons of coal sits in the ground unused in the Kaiparowits Plateau because Bill Clinton had the foresight to designate it as a national monument. Why can't we leave oil in the ground in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for another generation? Wilderness designation can preserve oil shale for a time when it is technologically and environmentally feasible for it to be part of the energy solution.\Lock it up and let it sit idle for a generation or two. Give our grandkids a chance to decide when that energy might be best used.\It's time to make real sacrifices in terms of conservation and yes, higher taxes, to find viable alternatives for energy needs too long met by cheap oil, coal and natural gas.\It's also time to set aside more wilderness not only to preserve what's left of our wild heritage but also to lock up resources for future generations or, even better, until viable energy alternatives are discovered.\--- \Tom Wharton can be contacted at wharton@sltrib.com or 801-257-8909.

175,"Utah's economy is booming again, growing at a clip that will provide legislators and Gov. Gary Herbert more additional money to spend than they have had since 2007, before the Great Recession.\All told, state leaders will have an additional $638 million to pay for an array of programs, including education, roads, social services, prisons and more.\The numbers come ahead of Herbert's budget proposal, which is scheduled for release Thursday. The governor attributed the robust forecast to the state's thriving economy and pro-business policies.\""Our commitment to conservative fiscal principles and to cultivating the nation's most business-friendly environment will now allow us to make sound investments to continue our economic expansion and enhance our quality of life,"" the governor said in a statement.\Of the $638 million total, about half ccc $325 million ccc is available for new or ongoing programs or salaries. The rest will be reserved for one-time expenditures, items such as road or building construction or equipment purchases.\The vast majority of the surplus revenue comes from increased personal and corporate income-tax collections. Under the Utah Constitution, those funds go to public schools and colleges.\The revenue forecast has jumped dramatically, coming in 50 percent higher than the most optimistic projection given to legislators in October.\But Republican legislative leaders were quick to try to tamp down expectations and made clear that the new revenue might not translate to spending increases.\House Speaker-elect Greg Hughes, R-Draper, said Utah was one of the hardest hit states during the recession. But he said it also was one of the quickest to recover, he believes, because it had been conservative with its spending and had money socked away in its Rainy Day Funds.\Today those reserves aren't where leaders would like them to be, Hughes said, and it makes sense during the good times to prepare for the bad.\""We don't think the state is as well-situated [for a downturn],"" Hughes said, ""and we want to be.""\So, on Tuesday, legislative leaders voted to take more than a third of the additional ongoing money off the table for programs ccc a hedge against future economic volatility. They reserved another $30 million until the end of the session and directed budget subcommittees to cut their allocations by 2 percent across the board.\Senate Budget Chairman Lyle Hillyard, R-Logan, said the goal is to ensure the money the state already is spending is being used as efficiently as possible. If savings can be found, it gives lawmakers more flexibility when it comes to moves such as bolstering education spending.\It also sends a signal to advocates and groups asking for money that legislators aren't going to tolerate a free-for-all.\""We put enough of a kibosh on that,"" Hillyard said.\The longtime Logan lawmaker is encouraged by the budget forecasts.\""It gives us a little bit of money to do some things we haven't been able to do for a little while,"" Hillyard said. ""But mark my words: When we get to the end [of the session], we won't have enough money.""\Hughes said that, given the surplus in tax collections, it's unlikely that a tax increase would get serious consideration, although there could be some debate about shifting how taxes are collected and a look at the dwindling gas-tax revenues.\There are a series of demands driven by population growth that lawmakers will have to address.\For example, nearly 8,000 new students are expected to enter Utah schools next year. It is the smallest rate of growth in more than a decade, but will still cost an additional $54 million.\Add the new education costs to growth in programs such as Medicaid, higher costs for health insurance for state employees, paying to maintain buildings, and giving a small pay raise to state employees and teachers, and lawmakers could burn through $178 million right off the top.\gehrke@sltrib.com\Twitter: @RobertGehrke\Credit: By Robert Gehrke The Salt Lake Tribune"
176,"
SALT LAKE CITY - New House Speaker Greg Hughes urged lawmakers on the opening day of the Utah Legislature to engage in the ""big, hard fights"" needed to take on tough issues, including boosting gas tax revenues this session.
\
Hughes, R-Draper, took the oath of office Monday with the husband and daughters of his predecessor, the late Becky Lockhart, by his side, and reminded representatives that ""she wasn't a big fan of inaction.""
\
The House passed a resolution honoring Lockhart, 46, who died at her home earlier this month after a brief battle with a fatal and extremely rare neurodegenerative brain disease known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease or CJD.
\
House Majority Whip Francis Gibson, R-Mapleton, said the first legislation to go before the House, HR3, was ""simple but heartfelt."" It was approved 74-0.
\
Senate President Wayne Niederhauser, R-Sandy, became emotional while talking about how much Lockhart loved doing the people's work in the people's house, the state Capitol.
\
""I don't know anyone who appreciated this as much as Speaker Lockhart,"" he said in opening remarks to the Senate. ""Her untimely passing reminds us of our mortality and the unpredictable nature of our lives.""
\
Niederhauser said Lockhart's death caused him to reflect on the seats he and the other 28 senators hold. Although they refer to them as ""my seat"" or ""my office,"" they really don't belong to them. Someone else will fill those seats in the future and might do a better job, he said.
\
""Sometimes we overestimate our contributions,"" Niederhauser said. ""We are not the be all, end all.""
\
The Senate president ticked off a list of issues - Medicaid, transportation, water, education, prison relocation, religious freedom and anti-discrimination - lawmakers will tackle this year.
\
""I don't recall being faced with so many big issues in one session,"" he said. ""It will surely test our courage and wisdom, and our ability to set politics aside to do what is right for the long-term health, safety and prosperity of our state.""
\
Niederhauser told senators to ""buckle up"" and go to work.
\
In his opening speech, Hughes called Lockhart ""a strong example to us all"" and said he is the ""product of many strong-willed women,"" including the single mother who raised him in Pennsylvania with help from his aunts and grandmother.
\
Hughes referred to his longtime love of boxing, saying he's not afraid of a fight and likes ""a good win.""
\
Expected battles this session over issues including raising the gas tax, Medicaid expansion and moving the Utah State Prison, he said, are ""potentially transformational fights"" for the state.
\
The current 24.5 cents per gallon tax on gas, unchanged since 1997, ""is broken, and it stopped working long ago. It is up to us to fix it,"" Hughes said, and not by taking what he called the ""simplest approach of just raising the gas tax.""
\
He said improving air quality also needs to be talked about, but the discussion should not pit the environment against the economy. He said natural gas from the Uintah Basin could be ""an important component"" to solving air pollution.
\
Hughes said the Legislature will be a ""great partner"" to those who want to be part of the solution, but those ""who want to rattle sabers or obstruct what is possible"" may end up being taught a lesson by lawmakers.
\
Unlike Lockhart, who had been seen as a possible challenger to GOP Gov. Gary Herbert and criticized him as an ""inaction figure,"" Hughes said lawmakers look forward to working with the governor on his Healthy Utah alternative to Medicaid expansion.
\
""But this is not a simple yes or no issue,"" Hughes said, calling the decision over whether to accept nearly $300 million in federal funds available to help provide health care coverage to the poor one that must ""stand the test of time.""
\
Later, the new speaker stopped short of saying he is taking a new tone with Herbert. ""Politics is addition,"" Hughes said, that requires legislation receive the support of a majority of House and Senate members as well as the governor to become law.
\
""I don't know how you get there by dividing, or parsing, or trying to huddle in small corners. I think you have to come together,"" Hughes said. ""We're going to reach out. We're going to make sure those conduits of communications are open.""
\
House Majority Leader Jim Dunnigan, R-Taylorsville, said after an ""extremely frank"" meeting last week between lawmakers and Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, he hopes the legislative and executive branch can come to an agreement on Medicaid expansion.
\
A longtime supporter of moving the prison from Draper to allow the prime Point of the Mountain real estate to be developed, Hughes said in his opening address that the process to find a new site has been ""imperfect, but it is possible, and we will do it.""
\
Sen. Jerry Stevenson, R-Layton, who serves as Prison Relocation Commission co-chairman, said he agrees that it's not if but when the prison moves. None of the reasons for moving have changed since lawmakers debated the issue last year, he said.
\
Stevenson said he hopes lawmakers can settle on a new site by the end of the session, but others, including Hughes, have suggested that's not likely to happen as new potential locations are considered.
\
Building a state budget also will be a difficult issue, even with revenue growth and surplus funds totaling $638 million available to spend.
\
Leaders in the GOP-controlled Legislature have asked each state agency to scour its budget for 2 percent in savings, an exercise that Senate Budget Chairman Lyle Hillyard, R-Logan, said yielded $70 million last year.
\
Hillyard doesn't expect to find that much this year, but it would help lawmakers better understand how state agencies use their money and help form a basis for planning a new budget.

177,"Valley air quality in Utah is a health crisis! And it's not just a winter inversion problem. Anyone hiking up our mountains in spring, summer or fall will look down on a putrid brownish layer that isn't as noticeable until you rise above it. The air up above is markedly sweeter and purer.\Every day thousands of gas-powered vehicles belch toxic carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. They need to be replaced with clean electric and natural gas vehicles. We have the technology; let's use it. Utah has an expanding number of natural gas and electric charging stations. The Legislature needs to provide a large ""one-time"" taxpayer incentive to transition to these pollution-free vehicles, and replace the gas tax with a new tax on electric and natural gas vehicles to offset and aid in this transition.\Air pollution is a huge detriment to our health and economy. Representatives of the people, let's get serious and do the right thing for Utah and its citizens. Imagine the respect and stature Utah would gain if we resolved this noxious air quality problem. We may be last in per capita spending on education, but we have the most polluted air in the nation too. We can certainly get by spending less per student, but in the end if we destroy our health, economy and environment, education won't really matter. Our students may even get better grades and a better education if they have clear air to breathe.\Rick Bingham\Centerville\Credit: By Rick Bingham For the Deseret News"

180,"CEDAR CITY -- Fuel-efficient vehicles, including hybrids and natural gas vehicles, help reduce pollution and can save drivers money at the pump -- but they are also causing a nationwide concern as state governments attempt to make up for lost gas tax revenue.\""The fuel efficiency of cars does affect the gas tax,"" said Kevin Kitchen, public information officer for the Utah Department of Transportation. ""That's a trend that's been verified nationwide.""\Several studies, including one from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, shows America's appetite for oil waning. Since a peak demand in 2007, demand of oil in America has been steadily and dramatically declining, with an expected continual drop of at least 7 percent over the next quarter century. While various factors can be attributed to this phenomena -- including an aging population that is driving less -- the main factor is that vehicles are becoming more fuel efficient.\According to J.P. Powers and Associates, fuel efficiency is the number one factor people take into consideration when purchasing a vehicle.\That was certainly the case for Enoch resident Morgan Ritter, who recently purchased a new Volkswagen Golf, which boasts 42 highway miles per gallon.\""I don't need a lot of space or hauling capabilities; I need to save money,"" Ritter said.\Others, like Cedar City resident Ryan Gunn, utilize natural gas vehicles. Gunn has a custom-built Chevrolet heavy-duty van he uses as a camper. Gunn can switch back and forth between natural gas and gasoline.\""It gets about 12 miles to the gallon (on gasoline),"" Gunn said. ""It gets the equivalent of 25 or 26 miles per gallon (on natural gas). I was excited about getting it because it makes it affordable to drive something like that.""\The problem comes from the fact that revenue from the 24.5-cent state gasoline tax used for repairing and maintaining roads -- called the B and C fund -- has been dropping, along with gas purchases. That means less money for the roads. These funds are not used on new projects, but to maintain roads.\B and C road funds are collected by the state and distributed to counties and municipalities based on miles of road and population. In 2012, Utah spent $124 million for B and C road funds, of which approximately $1.5 million went to Iron County, $1.3 million went to Washington County and $1.5 million went to Garfield County.\With budgets shrinking, the state legislature is mulling ideas to raise more money for roads, including the possibility of a local option gas tax.\Iron County Commissioner Alma Adams said at Monday's county commission meeting that such a program would see counties and cities opting into a tax to the tune of 5 to 10 cents per gallon. If they opt in, they would get an additional 10 percent in funding while they would lose 20 percent of funding if they opt out.\Adams said the idea is still in preliminary phases and nothing has been decided yet.\""It's a dilemma. The gas tax isn't cutting it, but I don't think people want to hear about a gas tax increase,"" Adams said.\Ritter doesn't like the idea.\""What would be the point then? I didn't buy my car to save the environment; I bought it to save money. If they charge more for gas then what's the point?"" Ritter said.\County Commissioner Dale Brinkerhoff suggested that increasing the tax on natural gas vehicles could be a better alternative. Currently, natural gas is taxed at 8.5 cents per gallon as opposed to gasoline's 24.5 cents per gallon.\""I know we want to encourage people to use (natural gas vehicles) but they use the roads just like everyone else,"" Brinkerhoff said.\Gunn believes an increase in price at the pump for natural gas vehicles wouldn't make it worthwhile to own one, citing increased costs when it comes to initial purchase price, conversion prices and maintenance.\""Right now it costs less, but not by much,"" Gunn said. ""Without that lower price at the pump, it wouldn't be worth it.""\While the final solution may not be popular, Kitchen said something will need to happen to reverse the trend.\""We will do what the legislators tell us,"" Kitchen said. ""This is a problem every (department of transportation) across the country is facing."""
181,"
HOUSTON -- Don't expect motorists to sympathize, but Exxon Mobil Corp. says gasoline prices didn't do it any favors in the first quarter.
\
Still, the world's largest publicly traded oil company said Thursday that it earned $10.9 billion to start 2008, the second-biggest U.S. quarterly profit ever. The smaller Marathon Oil Corp. said its profit rose 2 percent to $731 million, well ahead of Wall Street forecasts.
\
As in the past, the extraordinary results from Exxon Mobil prompted critics to insist the company and other major oil producers were profiting at the expense of frustrated consumers, who are paying more than ever to drive. Indeed, retail gas prices on Thursday rose to a new high above $3.62 a gallon.
\
But because gasoline prices have not kept pace with oil's stunning ascent to triple digits, Exxon Mobil and other big oil companies have seen far lower margins from refining and selling gasoline and other petroleum products.
\
That's because Exxon Mobil and others don't produce enough oil to satisfy their refining operations, so they have to buy crude at market prices, too.
\
Exxon Mobil said earnings at its refining and marketing arm were off 39 percent in the most recent quarter, one reason overall results fell well short of Wall Street's lofty forecasts.
\
Year over year, however, earnings for the company, based in Irving, Texas, rose 17 percent, lifted largely by record crude prices. The only higher total in a three-month period was the $11.7 billion Exxon Mobil posted in the final three months of 2007.
\
""In an environment of high commodity prices, Exxon Mobil's outstanding portfolio of integrated businesses performed well, allowing us to deliver record first-quarter results,"" Henry Hubble, the company's vice president of investor relations, said on a conference call.
\
Not everyone was celebrating, particularly given the sluggish economy and housing crisis.
\
""Oil companies are racking up obscene profits left and right, while American families are stretched to the limit by skyrocketing gas prices,"" U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a statement. ""It's time for Big Oil to pay its fair share.""
\
He and New York's other senator, presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, have called for a windfall tax on oil companies. Clinton wants such a tax to pay for a proposed three-month suspension on the federal gas tax. Republican Sen. John McCain also supports the so-called gas-tax holiday, though he wouldn't place the burden on oil companies.
\
Already this year, top executives of the country's five biggest oil companies were hauled before federal lawmakers to explain their profits and assure customers they weren't being gouged. The executives' overriding sentiment: Don't blame us.
\
At a hearing last month, the executives said they understood that record fuel prices were hurting consumers but argued it's not their fault and their huge profits were in line with other industries.
\
Crude prices, which reached a record $119.93 a barrel this week, have already led to bountiful first-quarter profits for several other major oil companies, despite higher costs and lower results from refining.
\
BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Europe's two biggest oil producers, posted combined profits of nearly $17 billion this week -- $7.6 billion for BP, up 63 percent, and $9.08 billion for Shell, an increase of 25 percent. ConocoPhillips reported a 16 percent rise in net income last week to $4.14 billion.
\
Chevron Corp., the No. 2 U.S. oil company, is expected to continue the trend when it reports first-quarter results Friday.

182,"BC-US--Taking a Toll, 1st Ld-Writethru,1358\States looking to new tolls to pay for highways\AP Photo WX201, WX202, WX203, WX204, WAET202\Eds: Updates with details, quotes. With BC-Taking a Toll-EZPass. With AP Photos.\By JOAN LOWY\Associated Press\WASHINGTON - Driving onto an Interstate highway? Crossing a bridge on the way into work? Taking a tunnel under a river or bay? Get ready to pay.\With Congress unwilling to contemplate an increase in the federal gas tax, motorists are likely to be paying ever more tolls as the government searches for ways to repair and expand the nation's congested highways.\Tolling is less efficient and sometimes can seem less fair than the main alternative, gasoline taxes. It can increase traffic on side roads as motorists seek to evade paying. Some tolling authorities -- often quasi-governmental agencies operating outside the public eye -- have been plagued by mismanagement. And some public-private partnerships to build toll roads have drowned in debt because of too-rosy revenue predictions.\Tolls are hardly a perfect solution. But to many states and communities, they're the best option available.\""It's very hard in this environment for states to add capacity without charging a toll because they can't afford to do it,"" said Joshua Schank, president of the Eno Center for Transportation, a Washington think tank. ""They're barely able to maintain what they've got, and there is an urgent need for capacity.""\Some changes already are under way\In addition to the tolls allowed on Interstates in 15 states, mostly in the Northeast and Midwest, the U.S. has agreed to pilot toll projects on Interstate 95 in Virginia and North Carolina and on Interstate 70 in Missouri.\A commission created by Congress to recommend ways to pay for upkeep of the nation's transportation system predicted in 2009 that the U.S. will face nightmarish congestion unless it spends more. The commission estimated all levels of government were spending a cumulative $137 billion less each year than is necessary to maintain and expand the current system. Without action, there will be a $2 trillion-plus backlog by 2035, it said.\It's been nearly two decades since Congress last increased the federal gas and diesel taxes that have historically paid for highways. Meanwhile, the cost of road and bridge construction has gone up and the purchasing power of fuel taxes has declined by more than a third. Revenue is also down because people have been driving less due to the uncertain economy and because cars are becoming more fuel-efficient.\Federal and state fuel tax revenues peaked in 2007 at $72.4 billion, then dropped to $68.6 billion in 2010, the most recent year for which data are available. Meanwhile, state toll collections rose from $4.9 billion in 2000 to $8.9 billion in 2010, and locally administered tolls rose from $1.6 billion in 2000 to $2.5 billion in 2009.\The trust fund that pays for federal highway programs is forecast to go broke sometime next year, though the House and Senate are trying to negotiate a bill to shore up the funding and overhaul transportation programs. It's unclear whether they'll reach a deal, but if they do, it's likely to contain only a short-term financial fix. That means lawmakers will be back again, scratching for more.\Tolling is the easiest near-term way to pay the bills, says Robert Atkinson, who chaired the financing commission. ""If you could allow modest tolling on Interstates, you could raise a lot of money,"" he said.\Fifteen states, mostly in the Northeast and Midwest, that had turnpikes before the 1956 advent of the Interstate system have grandfathered permission to collect tolls on 2,900 miles of the 47,000-mile system. But federal restrictions prevent other states from placing tolls on federal-aid highways except in limited circumstances.\States want Congress to increase their ability to charge tolls and to allow them to use the money for a variety of transportation needs -- not just upkeep of the roads where tolls are collected, said Eugene Conti, North Carolina's transportation secretary, at a Senate hearing last month.\But states also have a history of slapping tolls on roads traveled by a large share of out-of-state motorists. When Pennsylvania applied to put tolls on Interstate 80, a route favored by truckers, the federal government rejected the plan partly because some of the money raised would have gone to support public transit in Philadelphia, even though the highway doesn't touch the city's metro area. In 2004, Chicago leased its Skyway, an eight-mile road and bridge, to a private toll operator for 99 years in exchange for $1.8 billion that was used to pay off city debt. The resulting toll increases fell heavily on Indiana commuters who use the road to get to jobs in Chicago.\Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., has introduced a bill to give the secretary of transportation oversight of tolling practices. The financing commission made a similar recommendation.\What to do about tolling isn't addressed in the highway bill now before Congress because of a standoff earlier this year between senators who favor and oppose easing tolling on Interstate highways. The issue is expected to be revived next year after the retirement of Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who has led the opposition to greater tolling.\One concern is that the Interstate system is aging, which means money must be found to repair and replace the roads.\""The roads are out there and we've paid off the mortgage, but that doesn't mean the system is paid for. ... Now the roads are crumbling and we have to upgrade them,"" said Patrick Jones, executive director of the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, which represents toll facilities.\Some relaxation of the ban is in the works. The Transportation Department has selected the three states -- Virginia, North Carolina and Missouri -- for pilot toll projects.\A $2 billion project now under way would add High Occupancy Toll lanes on Interstate 495 in the Virginia suburbs of Washington. The state can't afford to build the lanes on its own, but money raised by a private investment partnership and a $586 million federal loan made the project possible.\Motorists who buy an E-ZPass that can be read electronically will be able use the lanes. Toll prices will fluctuate depending on traffic density. If toll lanes are crowded, prices will keep rising until enough motorists decide to remain in the slower lanes. The aim is to give motorists a way to travel quickly, but only if they are willing to pay for it -- an idea that has stirred controversy. Cars with three or more passengers will be able to use the lanes without paying.\The administrative costs of tolling are far greater than the gas tax, even when using electronic tolling, said Phineas Baxandall, a senior analyst with the private, consumer-oriented U.S. PIRG.\Some tolling agencies could also use ""a dose of sunshine,"" Baxandall said. Because many are quasi-governmental, public disclosure, open meeting and other transparency rules don't always apply, he said. As a result, they frequently operate out of public sight, creating opportunities for corruption or manipulation by industry, he said.\A report by the New Jersey comptroller in March said cronyism and mismanagement at the Delaware River Port Authority had wasted millions of dollars. The authority operates four bridges, a ferry and a rail line across the Delaware River between New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey recently raised cash fares on six Interstate bridges and tunnels to $12 for cars. By 2015, it will cost a five-axle truck paying cash $105 to cross between New York and New Jersey, three times as much as for any other bridge or tunnel in the country, according to the American Trucking Association. Bill Baroni, the authority's deputy executive director, told a Senate hearing the fare hikes are necessary to make up for years of neglect and mismanagement.\Despite concerns about more and higher tolls, it's difficult for lawmakers to tell state and local governments not to pursue greater tolling when Congress isn't providing a comparable alternative source of funds.\Jones, of the tolling industry association, predicted that as traffic congestion worsens, people ""are going to demand, 'We need better roads, we need more efficiency,' and they are going to ask for tolling and direct user fees to build the transportation that they need.""\------\Follow Joan Lowy at http://www.twitter.com/AP--Joan--Lowy\States looking to new tolls to pay for highways\Credit: By Joan Lowy"
183,"Everywhere you turn, in any city with a railroad-building appetite, someone decries public subsidies for transit systems that serve a small segment of the population.\It has been the fundamental rallying point for anti-rail activists during the national surge in metropolitan rail systems over the past 15 years. Its appeal to cost-conscious citizens is why many opponents organize under the banner of tax watchdogs rather than rail bashers. And it is a debate that is sure to be dragged out again if, as expected, Wasatch Front counties ask voters for an extra quarter- cent sales tax to fund commuter or light rail this fall.\But what about roads and highways, the subsidized arteries that most Utahns capitalize on every day? Depending on the perspective -- pro- or anti-rail -- roads are either a drain on taxpayers, consumers and the environment, or they are completely funded by the people who use them.\""There's little if any subsidy to roads,"" said Wendell Cox, an Illinois-based transportation consultant who has reversed his position since voting for rail transit as a member of the Los Angeles Transportation Commission in the 1980s. ""Roads are paid for by dedicated user fees added on to gasoline prices.""\In other words, at least the federal interstate highway system and arguably most highways are built and maintained with taxes from the people who actually use them.\""It is fair to say with respect to non-local roads that there is no subsidy,"" Cox said.\That is not how rail backers see it.\""That's certainly not true on local roads, and believe me, I don't think the Utah gas tax is covering I-15 [reconstruction],"" said Richard Hodges, an economist for the Utah Transit Authority.\So that 17-mile project, estimated at $1.34 billion, may indeed be funded mostly by drivers, but not necessarily by drivers who will use it.\""Every local government has a portion of their budget that goes to road maintenance,"" Hodges said. ""There's the hidden subsidy, and for some communities that's a big chunk of their budget.""\And even if the interstate system is paid for largely through user fees, it is worthless without local connectors, usually subsidized by property taxes, to get people from their driveways to the on-ramp.\Hodges wrote a report analyzing the costs -- public and private -- of driving on the Wasatch Front in the mid-1990s, when UTA was pushing for the light-rail system it has since opened in the Salt Lake Valley. Although the dollar figures are outdated and UTA has not revisited the research since, Hodges said the concepts and ratios remain valid.\Hodges found that gasoline taxes and other user fees covered about 60 percent of the $33.3 billion that all levels of government spent on road-building and maintenance each year. Some $68 billion not covered by user fees went to highway patrols, traffic management, parking enforcement, accident and theft investigation and street maintenance. He called $10 billion a ""low estimate"" for air- pollution costs including illness, death and reduced crop yields. He also noted the incalculable costs of 50,000 annual traffic fatalities and greenhouse gas emissions.\Considering all these factors and the car maintenance costs that individual drivers pay, Hodges then presented Boston's estimates of peak- and off-peak hour commuter costs to show that rail makes sense. According to his report, moving commuters by rail cost 29 cents per mile during peak hours and 69 cents during off-peak hours. For car commuters driving alone, the cost was at least 81 cents a mile during peak hours and 79 cents during off-peak hours.\Cox, whose organization Public Purpose administers a Web site that is critical of tax subsidies for rail transit, offers different figures. Using 1996 U.S. Department of Transportation figures, the Web site (www.publicpurpose.com) shows an average per-passenger-mile cost of $1.82 among 18 American rail systems. That compares to about 37 cents or less for the average cost on urban freeway lanes, about half of which is the personal cost of owning a car.\Cox blamed easy federal funding for a rail resurgence that he believes makes no sense. The Federal Transit Administration generally pays at least 80 percent of construction costs, as it did with UTA's TRAX light rail. He maintains that rail transit effectively subsidizes downtown areas, even though the majority of jobs have long since left the nation's downtowns.\""The numbers just don't work,"" Cox said. ""It's a cute little thing, and some people like it,"" but, ""it's just a downtown solution.""\Alan Pisarski, another transportation consultant and former deputy director of the U.S. Department of Transportation, agreed that rail systems are far more subsidized than roads, and are often a waste of tax dollars.\The gas tax pays for interstates, he said, and many cities and counties even incorporate roads into their property tax assessments by charging owners for their street frontage. By contrast, he said, regions build rail transport because the federal government is handing out money.\Pisarski acknowledged it is appropriate to factor such costs as pollution into the overall cost of roads and cars. But he said it is not enough to tip the balance toward transit.\""If you charged everybody the appropriate costs tomorrow, there wouldn't be much change on the highways,"" he said. ""But there would be radical changes in transit.""\Commuter and light-rail systems are built largely with affluent commuters in mind, as opposed to the nation's bus systems that cater to people who do not own cars, Pisarski said. Many cities are trying to build or expand rail systems because of an ""edifice complex,"" he said. It makes them feel more cosmopolitan.\""I have no problem at all with people deciding in their community that they want this kind of system or that kind of system, as long as they spend their own money,"" he said.\The question that often gets lost in the debate about transportation subsidies is whether transit is a better investment to handle growth, said Brad Barber, director of the Utah Governor's Office of Planning and Budget. Transit is more directly subsidized by government, but it also gains in value as freeway lanes become harder to build in crowded areas, he said. And offering an alternative that takes cars off the roads benefits everyone whether they ride or not.\""Transit would look better in that comparison,"" Barber said.\Above all, he said, expanding transit offers residents a choice. As it is, most Utahns have no alternative to climbing in the driver's seat.\""Because we're doing what we're doing, we're not allowing a choice,"" Barber said. ""We're making them use the highways because we're not providing a transit system."""
184,"
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate moved Monday to add about $11 billion to a six-year highway and transit bill, putting it on a collision course with the Bush administration and a threatened veto.
\
Senate leaders said the revised package with the extra money, which would raise spending for the long-delayed legislation to about $295 billion, would be paid for by finding new revenue for the federal highway trust fund. A vote on the bill, including the $11 billion addition, could come by the end of the week.
\
But Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta, in a statement put out in anticipation of the Senate move, said it would bankrupt the trust fund -- the money coming in from the federal gas tax -- by using accounting gimmicks.
\
""There is a dark cloud looming that will needlessly delay many important highway and transportation projects,"" Mineta said.
\
The previous six-year highway bill expired in September 2003 and has had to be continued through six temporary extensions because of conflict between Congress and the White House over spending levels.
\
Last year the White House proposed a $256 billion package, up from $218 billion from the 1998-2003 act, and threatened to veto any bill that added to the federal deficit. This year the administration has said that anything above $284 billion, the number approved by the House in March, would be subject to a presidential veto.
\
The Senate, which last year approved a $318 billion bill, has pressed for higher spending, saying more was needed to reverse the current situation of inadequate, congested and deteriorating roadways.
\
The Texas Transportation Institute's 2005 Urban Mobility Report issued Monday found that in 2003 there were 3.7 billion hours of travel delay and 2.3 billion gallons of wasted fuel for a total cost of more than $63 billion to the nation.
\
Senate leaders hope to finish work on their bill this week, setting the stage for negotiations with the House on a compromise measure that might be acceptable to the administration. The latest extension expires May 31.
\
""There may be more of a will to get it done"" this year, said Steve Sandherr, CEO of the Associated General Contractors of America and a leading proponent of a robust bill. He said the disparity with the White House wasn't as great as last year. ""Over six years, $11 billion is not a big deal"" for such a major bill, he said.
\
Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman James Inhofe, R-Okla., said the extra $11 billion, which includes about $8.8 billion for the highway program and $2.15 billion for transit, would help ease the discord resulting from some states paying more into the highway trust fund than they get back in federal grants.
\
Inhofe said the money would mean that states would immediately get a minimum guarantee of 91 cents back for every dollar sent to Washington, with the rate going up to 92 percent by the end of the legislative period. Donee states, who get more than they pay in, would be assured of a growth in funds given the larger pool of money.
\
The new revenue package, crafted by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and ranking Democrat Max Baucus of Montana, would not increase the federal gas tax, now 18.4 cents per gallon of gas.
\
The money would come from steps to prevent fuel tax evasion, and shifting some funds that now go to the general Treasury fund, including a gas guzzler tax, to the highway trust fund. There would be provisions to close corporate tax loopholes to assure that there would be no losses to the general fund.
"
185,"Despite beginning each day with a prayer, dressing neatly and wearing amiable smiles, members of the 1997 Legislature at times have lapsed into antics more suited to playground bullies.\From advancing legislation taking a swipe at filmmaker-environmentalist Robert Redford to table-pounding outbursts, name-calling and cutting off public witnesses, lawmakers have had some notable lapses in decorum during the past six weeks.\``The Legislature has become much more mean-spirited and much more personal, in a negative way,'' says Lawson LeGate, director of the Sierra Club's southwest regional office.\``It's the meanest session I've ever been in,'' says Claire Geddes, a four-year veteran Capitol lobbyist for Ross Perot's United We Stand, America of Utah.\``There's an edge that wasn't there before,'' said House Minority Secretary Roberta Moore. ``We've lost the humor and the statesmanlike attitude.''\As the annual session grinds to its Wednesday midnight conclusion carrying a cargo of more than 700 bills, the mood is growing inevitably more edgy.\But even before the tension-fueled jags of the final days, there was a chip-on-the-shoulder attitude this session.\It started with the early power struggle between Republican Gov. Mike Leavitt and legislative leaders of his own majority party for control of the session's financial agenda.\Weeks before the Jan. 20 opening of the Legislature, Leavitt suggested he might propose a handful of ``options'' for financing a $2.6 billion highway building program; GOP legislative bosses balked. They urged him, instead, to make a recommendation to which they could respond. As a result, Leavitt took the most politically risky action of his four years in office -- proposing a gas-tax increase of 7.5 cents phased in during four years.\Legislators wasted no time in delivering what appeared to be the equivalent of a sucker punch. They rejected the governor's proposal out of hand, and in fact deliberately excluded it from consideration during lengthy budget hearings.\``We don't need to talk about his plan,'' said House Speaker Mel Brown, R-Midvale.\The budget fight has been the Legislature's main event. There has been no competing issue vying for dominance as did the fury over gay-student support groups in public schools last year.\It is not that lawmakers are losing their appetite for arguing values. There just has not been a riveting moral issue that they could rally around, says David Nelson, a gay-rights activist who was caught up in last year's legislative maelstrom.\``They need a scapegoat,'' Nelson says. ``We have a new kind of Legislature that I have seen develop over the last few years.''\Campaigning on an anti-big government platform, a growing number of successful legislative candidates suddenly find themselves as part of the enemy camp, Nelson says.\``So they need a straw man to go after -- a boogeyman,'' he says. ``When you get too many of them on the Hill doing that, it's a mob mentality . . . and it just spins out of control.''\The most pointed example this year -- and one that has drawn national attention, including a crew last week from the TV tabloid program ``Hard Copy'' -- is the Robert Redford-Sundance resolution.\Sponsored by rancher and legislative rural caucus leader Brad Johnson, R-Aurora, the nonbinding statement of principle urges the Department of Natural Resources to study the feasibility of designating Redford's Sundance Resort as a wilderness area.\The measure was prompted by Redford's vocal support of President Clinton's declaration last year of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.\More importantly, the resolution may be the first instance in Utah where legislation was advanced that publicly slapped an individual for expressing an opinion disapproved by lawmakers.\``It doesn't say anything bad about Mr. Redford. It just lets him put his money where his mouth is,'' Johnson said the day House members approved the resolution on a 44-27 vote.\Countered Redford: ``The last time I looked, the Constitution allowed freedom of speech. I didn't notice anything about elected officials having the right to use state power in retaliation for it.''\Having made their point in the House, lawmakers let the matter drop.\Sen. Howard Nielson, R-Provo, calls the Redford resolution ``ridiculous, gratuitous and unnecessary,'' but he supported another anti-monument resolution this session chastising Clinton for having ``abused'' his authority.\Nielson, the only sitting state legislator who also has served in the U.S. Congress, insists the state Legislature is far more civil than Congress. But he acknowledges making ``a statement I probably shouldn't have'' during the heat of the monument debate.\Complaining that Clinton deliberately circumvented Utah elected officials, he speculated that late Democratic Gov. Scott Matheson would be ``spinning in his grave'' over the attendance of his widow, Norma Matheson, at the monument announcement last September in Arizona.\Norma Matheson later told The Tribune she viewed the comment as ``sheer conjecture'' and ``inappropriate.''\Nielson says he has privately discussed the remark with her.\Utah State University political scientist Michael Lyons says Utah is part of a national trend of declining civility in politics.\``Political life is now combative,'' Lyons says. ``Sharply divergent conflicting ideologies emerge to the surface and become prominent in our political dialogue.''\Lyons, who specializes in the study of Congress, says the trend largely is due to a shift in focus from traditional ``pork barrel'' money issues to ``values conflicts.'' These include issues such as the environment, homosexual rights and abortion, which tap into ingrained core beliefs.\``These are not compromisable types of issues,'' agrees political scientist Peter Galderisi, also of USU. ``If you are arguing over a tax cut of 10 percent or 20 percent, you can move to 15 percent and everyone goes home happy. But on issues such as abortion and school prayer, you can't do that.''\As the scholars point out, the trend has appeared before in American politics. Tempestuous political debate over slavery in the 19th century led to fist fights in Congress and even gunplay among members.\There has been no blood shed in the Legislature's disagreements.\But in at least one case this session there was a scuffle -- although its details are disputed -- between a legislator and a resident who came to testify on a bill to fund after-school programs for latchkey kids.\Provo resident Cynthia Smith insists she was ``shoved'' by Rep. Loretta Baca, D-Salt Lake City, as Smith was trying to hand the lawmaker a note. Baca, conversely, says Smith grabbed her arm, pulled her to within inches of her face and pushed her.\Smith says the incident has left her with the disturbing question of whether a concerned resident can ``voice her opinion without the fear of an elected official accosting her.''\Baca claims the confrontation left her shocked and frightened. She worries about the emotional eruptions resulting from ideological collisions.\``{Conservatives} think government is interfering in their lives, and government is part of our lives. The two beliefs are really clashing this year,'' says Baca, who says she is a ``left Democrat.''\The battles are occurring among legislators, too.\In fact, what may have been the session's low point in civility was a Feb. 19 meeting of the House Health and Human Services Committee. The topic was the session's only abortion bill: a plan to remake a state-produced video shown to women seeking abortions, which backers say will discourage such procedures.\Utah Eagle Forum President Gayle Ruzicka pleaded for support of any measure aimed at halting a procedure in which ``babies are ripped.'' Planned Parenthood executive Karrie Galloway then took her turn, telling lawmakers ``shame on you'' for bringing back the bill enacted just a year ago for more divisive debate.\Committee leader Rep. Nora Stephens, R-Sunset, waited until Galloway finished, then ruled her out of order for ``impugning the Legislature.''\But Stephens was silent when Rep. Bryan Holladay lost his temper -- pounding the table and thundering at Baca for a motion to require males to view the video when renewing their driver licenses.\Nor was there mention of impugning anyone when Rep. Carl Saunders, D-Ogden, remarked, ``We have not had any mothers or expectant mothers that have spoken against this bill. Just the reverse -- those representing motherhood in the group here have spoken for the bill.''\Galloway said the comment jarred her and other pro-choice audience members. ``We all looked at each other with our eyes wide. And I thought, I had better go home and tell my children.''\Holladay later apologized for his outburst, but said in an interview he has received more praise than damnation from the public. ``A lot of people have said it's about time,'' he said.\The West Jordan Republican, who earlier in the session publicly apologized for uttering off-color remarks during a debate on term limits, says he has become more cautious about comments that might offend.\At the same time, Holladay says, ``Sometimes it's too civil.''\To remain silent on issues such as abortion or prayer in schools, ``I wonder if that doesn't make me a moral coward,'' he says. ``Sometimes I feel I'm not being true to my basic core beliefs.''\But other lawmakers, particularly veterans, say letting debate become personal or overly emotional is a recipe for disaster.\Rep. Ray Short, R-Holladay, describes how recently he and executive-branch criminal justice official Camille Anthony locked horns over a bill to do away with an anti-violence coordinating committee.\``I fought her bill, but afterward I gave her a big hug,'' says Short. ``You can't take things personally. Otherwise, you go nutty.''\Sen. Howard Stephenson, R-Draper, says a lawmaker owes it to foes to put aside personalities and get to the merits of issues.\It explains why the arch conservative is reading Hillary Clinton's It Takes a Village, on loan from Democratic Senate leader Scott Howell. Howell, in turn, is perusing Stephenson's copy of Robert Bork's Slouching Toward Gommorrah.\``We're afraid of each other because of ignorance,'' says Stephenson, adding that he and Howell plan to get together after the session and compare notes on their new reading materials.\What could be more civilized?"

1. What is the major issue facing Utah today and how would you deal with it?
\
Economic prosperity and quality education for our children are inexorably linked. For too long, our children have been our most significant export by seeking jobs outside the state that cannot be found here. Building a stronger economy is key to Utah's future and the key to funding a quality education for our children and our grandchildren as well as providing beneficial economic opportunities for them upon graduation.
\
We must not allow this new century to begin without recognizing that economic development is critical to covering our costs going forward. Getting us there will require leadership, vision and a realistic plan. Utah's economy needs a positive new direction. If we stay on our current trajectory, we will be unable to fund education and support Utah's working families in the years ahead. We need a governor who will lead the charge in rejuvenating and expanding the state's economic base. In short, we need more quality, high-paying jobs in our state, and we need them now.
\
Economic development is the critical link that will allow Utah to pay for education by raising overall revenues -- not by raising taxes. In conjunction with many of Utah's best and brightest private sector leaders, I have developed a plan to revitalize Utah's economic base and provide the long-term funding required to educate our children. This plan centers on creating an environment that will allow Utah to sustain, attract, nurture and retain good businesses.
\
My 10-point economic plan -- when implemented in a timely, effective and coordinated manner -- will dramatically strengthen Utah's economy for the years ahead. The 10 points are as follows: (1) Revamp Utah's tax structure (2) Improve the competitive environment for small- and medium-size companies (3) Recruit businesses to our state (4) Attract more capital (5) Promote growth in target industries (6) Enhance Utah's national and international image (7) Capture global opportunities for Utah companies (8) Promote tourism (9) Energize economic development in rural communities (10) Make state government more efficient.
\
These 10 initiatives are interrelated. As we generate success in one area, that success will lead to success in other areas. Historically, our economic development efforts have lacked the required coordination to deliver long-term quality job growth in Utah. The coordinated implementation of this comprehensive set of initiatives will provide for greater economic success and momentum for Utah.
\
To secure economic development, Utah needs a governor who is capable of working effectively with both government and industry leaders to create a more business-friendly environment; an atmosphere in which companies can thrive and grow. We need a governor with extensive private sector experience and contacts, who can reach out to national and international industry leaders and attract companies (and jobs) to Utah. And finally, we need a governor who cares about the businesses that are already located here in Utah and will do what it takes to keep them here for the long haul. While government does not create jobs, the state can work with the private sector to improve the environment in which our state's businesses operate and thrive.
\
Utah needs a governor with a specific plan and the experience, desire and leadership necessary to make that plan a reality. As governor, I will leverage the relationships and experience I have gained serving in senior positions within the U.S. Department of Commerce, and as a U.S. Trade ambassador responsible for all U.S. trade relationships with Asia and Africa. These countries represent prime market opportunities for Utah goods and services. I will also bring to bear all of my private sector experience and relationships with national and international business leaders to attract companies to Utah as well as create strategic alliances with Utah businesses. I will fight for Utah's interests here and abroad.
\
I am convinced that revitalizing and expanding our economy is the only way to ensure that Utah will have enough quality, high-paying jobs and the funding to support our children's futures and increase the quality of their education.
\
2. What is the one personal trait/characteristic that you want voters to know about you, and why is that important in this race?
\
Some of the best and most innovative ideas come not from the offices with windows but from the associates on the ground level. I am open to new ideas, to new solutions, to new approaches to dealing with our state's problems. I have new eyes and an open mind. No other approach can truly bring a ""New Day for Utah.""
\
3. Should you win this office, are you willing to self-limit your time in office? If yes, how long would you serve in this office?
\
Yes.
\
Utah needs fresh eyes and new ideas in government to continue to grow and progress. In the best interest of Utah, each governor should serve a maximum of two four-year terms. I will limit myself to eight years -- if Utahns will have me -- and propose that we legislate term limits for the governor.
\
4. Do you believe changes are necessary in the state's child welfare system to ensure it does not violate parents' rights?
\
Yes.
\
If the system is out-of-balance and needs some changes, what specifically do you recommend?
\
Parents have a fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children. Unfortunately, there are certain situations requiring government intervention and support. I believe such involvement is justified only when the security of a child is at stake. Restoration of families must be the primary objective in such situations and the removal of a child from their family should only be pursued after all other reasonable alternatives have been exhausted. I am troubled about the inadequacies and subjectivity of determining at what juncture a child is deemed 'at risk.' I am also concerned that this pivotal decision of 'at risk' is too often blurred by irrelevant concerns involving bureaucratic vindication and institutional pride.
\
Family disintegration is placing increasing stress upon our child- welfare system. Admittedly, DCFS has a challenging task on the front lines of one of society's most perplexing problems. Burgeoning case loads and scarce resources test even the best of the many dedicated child-welfare workers. However, many Utahns fear that DCFS is either unwilling or unable to exercise good judgment in making child- welfare decisions. Whether or not that perception is real, the image of DCFS must and will change under my administration.
\
We must ensure that child safety determinations are made in a consistent and uniform manner according to clearly defined parameters. These decisions must also be made pursuant to due process without the influence of special or personal interests. The welfare of children and preservation of families must be the primary objective of this agency.
\
In addition, it may be appropriate to review the agency's hiring practices to ensure that highly competent individuals are involved in child safety determinations. I believe DCFS would benefit greatly from recruiting a variety of individuals with not only strong academic qualifications but also with practical and real world experience in supporting and improving our families.
\
I believe that DCFS would also benefit from more community oversight and transparency, especially by those without a financial or professional stake in the child-welfare industry. Dozens of organizations have input on child-welfare decision-making. Parents and critics alike should have more than a symbolic seat at the table in reviewing DCFS cases, policies, practices and procedures. As Utah's population grows in numbers, complexity and need, DCFS will continue to play a significant, albeit limited, role. It must not, however, exceed its authority and jurisdiction. We must fight lawsuits from outside the state that seek undue influence for political and financial gains.
\
Parents stand at the forefront in raising and nurturing their children. That role should not be subject to unnecessary scrutiny and intrusion by the state. Where state intervention is absolutely necessary, DCFS should enter the sacred family environment with respect and support. This agency must be seen as a peacemaker and healer, not a forceful intruder.
\
5. A lawmaker recently proposed eliminating the asset test for children to qualify for Medicaid, allowing 7,000 additional children to get insurance. While the proposal would have cost several million dollars, the idea would be to fund it through a cigarette tax increase. Would you support such a proposal?
\
Family assets represent an important factor in determining eligibility. However, I feel it is inappropriate to disqualify children for Medicaid because the family owns a $3,000 car. I propose that we continue applying the asset test, but exclude certain minimum threshold for a $3,000-5,000 car. As for funding, we may have dipped into the 'sin tax well' once too often. I am more comfortable looking at the overall tax structure and size of government and setting spending priorities. We can then focus on funding what citizens want most. As with other spending issues, this proposal would have to be considered in the broader context of prioritized spending.
\
6. Some lawmakers want the state Department of Health to implement a preferred drug list to keep prescription costs down for certain consumers. Would you favor or disfavor a preferred drug list?
\
No one doubts that prescription drug costs are high, but there may be even better ways than a preferred drug list to obtain cheaper prescription drugs for our state. I support approaches taken by governors in Michigan, Vermont, New Hampshire, Alaska and Nevada. They pool their resources to buy cheaper prescription drugs from manufacturers for those on Medicare. By joining with these other states, we can save Utahns money and bring larger market forces to bear on the prescription drug market. I am also concerned that a preferred drug list would limit patients' ability to choose drugs that may offer more effective treatment but which are not included on the preferred drug list.
\
Importation of drugs from Canada is worth exploring as prescription drug prices escalate. While the legality of importation is questioned, Health and Human Services Director Tommy Thompson has indicated his belief that importing drugs from Canada will eventually become legal. However, safety concerns and due regard for the R&D investment of U.S. pharmaceutical companies must be addressed, while finding creative methods to reduce the costs of prescription drugs.
\
7. As we saw recently, a family had to seek an abortion for a severely deformed fetus (which could not survive outside the womb) from a clinic because her hospital refused to perform the late-term abortion. Local hospitals say they are reluctant to perform abortions, because a law passed by the 2004 Legislature restricts public funding for entities that perform abortions. The new law doesn't make allowances for the health of the fetus or the mother. In light of these problems, do you still favor or still oppose the new law? If oppose, how should the law be changed?
\
I support the objective of the law. I do not believe that tax dollars should be used to fund elective abortions except in the case of rape, incest, life of the mother or fatal fetal abnormalities. While the law was considered for two years and apparently passed without dissent from the medical community, the case cited above merits review of the law. The sponsor of the bill, Sen. Bramble, has proposed changes to include abortion for fatal fetal abnormalities, tighter definition on physical health and the involvement of a medical review panel in diagnosing the conditions triggering application of the statute. I believe the proposed amendments appropriately remedy the concerns raised by the current law.
\
8. Do you favor or oppose the tuition tax credit bill proposed in the 2004 Legislature by Rep. Jim Ferrin? If you would have signed the bill as governor, what specifically will you do to help that bill, or one similar to it, be passed in the 2005 Legislature? If you oppose Ferrin's bill, what is your plan to move forward on the school choice issue?
\
I support Rep. Ferrin's bill, and I believe in tuition tax credits. I also believe that before implementing Ferrin's bill, we should pass the Carson Smith Special-Needs Bill and include broader student categories. I want to focus eligibility for these reform efforts on children our public schools have chronic difficulty in educating -- not those students who are currently doing well in public schools. Public schools will always be the first choice of the overwhelming number of Utah parents. Accordingly, any program of tax credits must hold public education harmless. Using targeted credits will pose the least risk to our public schools and will also provide a market test for choice in education. With the information and experience gathered from this first step in tax credits, Rep. Ferrin's bill can be implemented more effectively.
\
9. How can Utah prepare for 145,000 new public education students entering schools over the next decade? Be specific. Should the Legislature give local school districts more flexibility in assessing their own taxes? Should we just gut out the influx, counting on dropping student numbers in years ahead?
\
Part 1. Improved education performance and funding are vital to the future of our children and our economy. It is difficult to separate the idea of a world-class education from the goal of a world-class economy -- each is dependent on the other. I submit that my economic plan will be a boon to education. Its core theme is that the more high quality, long term, high paying companies Utah nurtures, attracts and retains, the larger the tax base from which Utah schools can draw. Education funding and performance are also about setting priorities, which will be the most important in my administration. However, new, creative funding sources must also constantly be sought after.
\
I believe we should be more aggressive in attracting private dollars to public schools. In Salt Lake City, for example, each school raises about $50,000 each year in additional funding. Clubs, school community councils, PTA groups, businesses and charitable endowments could help in this endeavor. Applying successful higher education fund-raising methods to public education would enhance this effort.
\
Arizona is a good example of where private sector fund-raising has greatly benefited public education. We must also look constantly at finding greater efficiencies in the administration of education. Utah already has one of the best administrator-to-student ratios in the nation, but I believe more can be done. For example, combine the purchasing power and other non-teaching functions of education while at the same time pushing education decision-making to the very lowest level -- parents, teachers and principals. We must also ensure that our school trust lands are properly administered and invested so that in the future these lands may provide greater support to our schools. I support the goals of our current trust land managers, which include emphasizing greater mineral development, ensuring receipt of fair market value in sales and leases, and working to exchange lands subject to federal development restrictions with lands that have greater economic potential. Finally, and perhaps most potentially significant, Utah should pursue the APPLE Initiative, which seeks to create a Western states trust fund for public education as compensation for our federally owned lands.
\
Part 2. In the context of overall tax reform, I believe raising more revenue locally for schools and local government should be considered. Raising taxes locally for schools may raise funding equalization issues. However, I do not support raising taxes overall. Where taxes are increased in one area, they should be lowered in one or more other areas to compensate. I believe that government is best when it governs closest to the people because it is more immediately responsive to shifting or changing community demands for services. It also tends to be more efficient and less wasteful. We should be leaving most decisions, including raising revenue, up to local governments rather than handing down unfunded or under-funded mandates from the state level.
\
Part 3. As mentioned above, I believe we have a number of options.
\
10. The state gasoline tax has not been raised since 1997, when it went up to help pay for reconstruction of I-15 in Salt Lake County. When tax revenues dropped off in the early 2000s, lawmakers and the former governor took sales tax revenue out of roads and bonded. How do we pay for more road repairs now, including rebuilding I-80 on the east side of Salt Lake County?
\
In recent years highway funding has not kept pace with our population growth and the growth in the number of vehicles traveling our roads. It is time to reverse that trend. Among other things, I favor restoring full funding to the Centennial Highway Fund. It must fulfill its intended purpose, to address demands for infrastructure growth. It is imperative, I believe, for all revenues generated from transportation specific sources (such as the gas tax) be spent on transportation and not on other government programs however worthy such programs may be. In addition, I would shift sufficient money from the general fund to meet our most pressing transportation needs. We cannot continue to hack, slash and postpone road improvements while bemoaning traffic problems. Roads must be finished as planned and projected. We should also continually reassess our priorities so we can better direct our road monies.
\
I support joint efforts between UDOT and local governments' both to fund and priorities transportation projects.
\
11. Do you believe the state gasoline tax must be adjusted upwards for inflation during your first term in office?
\
At this point, I would oppose an increase. Our spending priorities and economic plan need time to work before I would consider an increase.
\
12. Utah is in its sixth year of drought. Water development is a long-term effort. Specifically, what would you do to conserve water, to develop more fresh water? Should the current state sales tax dedicated to water development be removed, as former governors have suggested, and thus local water districts take on more of the development effort?
\
We must concentrate on maximizing our current infrastructure of water delivery. We have done a good job to this point but we can do better. Some say that as much as 20 percent of our water is lost due to inefficiencies. We must develop untapped resources into usable resources, recycling reusable water (or gray water) for non-potable water uses -- such recycling efforts will effectively reduce production demands on Utah's water systems and on promoting conservation of water.
\
Utah citizens use an average of approximately 321 gallons per person per day. That represents more water per person than any other state in the nation except Nevada, and yet Utahns pay some of the lowest fees for their water --lower than the national average and the Western city average with Utah's average at $1.15 per 1,000 gallons. That is at odds with the fact the Utah is a dry state.
\
According to the Utah Foundation, 63 percent of water used by Utah homes is used outdoors, not in. Conserving water is a relatively easy task once Utahns become aware of where and how to save it. Efforts in educating Utah citizens about conservation, such as the ""Slow the Flow, Save H2O"" campaign, should continue. According to the state of Utah, if we conserve 25 percent of our current average usage by 2050, we would save 400,000-acre-feet per year.
\
The state represents that such water savings is more water than the Jordanelle Reservoir could hold or any other water retention project in Utah. For our future needs, we have done a decent job of planning for our state. In some areas, for example, we have excelled. According to a U.S. Geological Survey cited in a recent Utah Foundation Research Report, Utah ranks No. 1 in the nation in the efficiency of our water delivery system. Most communities in Utah have a long range (10 year) plan to address future water demand. I applaud these efforts and the local leaders behind them.
\
We have large amounts of our portion of the Colorado River appropriation that is due to Utah, but currently untapped. As the water flows unused by Utah through to Nevada and California, Utah loses not only water but substantial revenue. I will support water storage efforts and various pipeline projects designed at maximizing the water due to Utah.
\
We cannot afford to give away water for free when we live in a desert! Counties depend upon the money generated by the 1/16th-cent sales tax to fund adequate infrastructure. As a Utah County Commissioner, my running mate, Gary Herbert, has had enough experience in this area to know that this money is put to good use by local communities. Too often in the past, the state has looked to this fund, intended for local governments, as a way to pay off budget shortfalls. As governor, I would commit to county governments that these monies would remain sacrosanct. Water development is too important to our quality of life to put on hold.
\
An increase in funding for future water development would be wise. Washington County is looking to spend approximately $300 million dollars by 2020 to bring water from Lake Powell. I support the pipeline project and will look at the other proposed pipelines as well. I also believe it is easier to conserve when the cost of water is not hidden in property taxes. I will work to make water costs directly reflective of water use by reducing the hidden water subsidy in our property taxes. Municipalities and individual communities should be responsible for establishing their own unique baseline use rates due to the unique nature of each community. The 1/ 16th-cent sales tax encourages such an approach.
\
13. While former governors have been successful in 'trading out' some state lands in wilderness study areas for other federal lands that can be developed, overall the wilderness issue in Utah has been stuck for more than 20 years. What specifically would you do to resolve the ongoing wilderness lands issue in Utah?
\
Governor Olene Walker's current approach of bringing all stakeholders together on a county by county basis shows promise. I support this practical approach and intend to continue it.
\
14. Do you favor or oppose any hazardous or radioactive waste of a higher degree of toxicity being allowed into Utah storage facilities? If yes, specifically what kind of waste could, and should, Utah take?
\
I strongly oppose any hazardous or radioactive waste of a higher degree of toxicity allowed into Utah storage facilities. We should not only stop B- and C-level waste from entering Utah, but should also tax the current level-A waste at comparable rates to other states. I will also partner with regional governors and put a stop to our region becoming the nation's dumping ground. Too long have we played the game where we are pointing the finger to Nevada and they are pointing back in regards to where nuclear waste should go. We should work with our neighbor to drive national policy that will keep the nuclear waste in the states that benefited from their generation.
\
15. Explain your stand on gay marriage in Utah. Will you be supporting Amendment 3 on Utah's November ballot?
\
I believe in the sanctity of marriage, and I believe in the traditional definition of marriage as between one man and one woman. However, activist judges in other jurisdictions have taken it upon themselves to redefine the meaning of marriage under the guise of constitutional interpretation. As a result of such judicial activism, it is no longer sufficient to rely solely on statutes to define marriage -- a constitutional amendment is now necessary to protect marriage and the family.
\
I will vote for Amendment 3 on Utah's November ballot which defines what marriage is and what it is not. I believe that protecting marriage also means precluding legal recognition of unions that are merely marriage by another name.
\
However, I am also convinced that we can and should pass legislation legally compatible with Amendment 3 that permits adults in economically dependant relationships to enter into a contractual arrangement to jointly own property, make medical decisions, funeral arrangements, and the like. Such arrangements would not be based on a sexual relationship and would in fact be applicable to a broad spectrum of Utahns, including adult children taking care of elderly parents, widows sharing homes after the passing of their spouses, life partners, as well as persons who may be homosexual partners.
\
Moreover, if Amendment 3 is challenged upon passage, I will vigorously defend it.
\
16. Do you favor or oppose the open space issue, which will now also be on the ballot?
\
I support the Open Space initiative. As I have said before, I would never wish upon Utah the ""legislation-by-initiative"" atmosphere of California, but I believe in the goals of this initiative. I applaud Utahn's for Clean Air, Clean Water, and Quality Growth for putting in the footwork necessary to place the issue on November's ballot.
\
Preserving open space along the Wasatch Front and in our beautiful rural areas is a challenge Utah must address. High quality of life is a crucial part of the legacy we must leave for our children. With so many citizens squeezed into the Wasatch Front, and close to a million more expected in the next 15 years, the demands of growth will bring great opportunity and a greater need for space. However, we must not allow the opportunities of growth to overshadow important considerations about our quality of life, which is a major consideration for those attracted to our state. We must be prepared to preserve the beautiful and sometimes overlooked spaces that make this state truly unique. This Open Space initiative represents a step forward in our careful stewardship of Utah's God-given beauty.
\
17. Do you favor or oppose hate-crime legislation? If yes, do you favor classifications of victims, and if so do you specifically favor higher penalties for those who attack homosexuals because of their sexual orientation?
\
Hate crimes are a subject I am open to discussion on, but I have some major concerns with any hate-crimes legislation. The First and 14th amendments are essential to our way of life. Do hate crimes punish actions or the thoughts behind the actions? We should not attempt to be the thought police. In regard to the 14th Amendment, it guarantees ""equal protection"" under the law. With hate crimes legislation, are we creating second-class victims? Is it more egregious for someone to be robbed because of his race than because he wears a nice coat? We need to be very careful in any discussion about hate crimes that we do not trample the very constitutional rights our country depends upon to deliver justice to our society.
\
18. As it stands now, citizens with concealed weapons permits may legally take their guns into public schools. Do you favor or oppose the current practice?
\
I am a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. I am a gun owner, I have a concealed carry permit, and I have even taught my children to shoot. I support the rights of concealed-carry permit holders, especially the right to protect themselves against criminals. The Utah Constitution gives even more clarification than the United States Constitution on gun ownership rights. It states, ""The individual right of the people to keep and bear arms for security and defense of self, family, others, property, or the state, as well as for other lawful purposes shall not be infringed; but nothing herein shall prevent the Legislature from defining the lawful use of arms."" I strongly support the Utah Constitution's stand on gun ownership, and will defend it fervently.
\
In practice, I oppose taking guns into schools. It just seems out of harmony with what is meant to occur within the walls of our educational facilities. However, banning law abiding, carefully licensed citizens from carrying their guns in schools will do nothing to prevent criminals from taking weapons into schools. Those with concealed weapons permits have passed muster with the state's requirements to maintain the privilege of carrying a concealed firearm. My concern is not with legally licensed, concealed carriers, but with those who illegally obtain, conceal, and use weapons.
\
19. As governor, would you support or oppose the University of Utah's current practice of controlling who can bring guns onto campus? What, if any, changes should be made to current state law relating to gun ownership and/or use?
\
The University of Utah has the right to challenge the current law, but not the right to disobey the law while challenging it. The court's rulings should be abided by. The rule of law must be respected, irrespective of what individuals or institutions think the law should be.
\
20. Utah's seat belt law for adults currently is a secondary offense. You can't be cited for not wearing your seat belt unless you are pulled over by law enforcement on some other moving violation offense and you are not wearing a seat belt. Should Utah have a primary seat belt law, which means if a cop sees you driving by not wearing your belt he can pull you over and cite you?
\
No. While I appreciate the message that might be sent, I do not see the need for primary enforcement of seat belt laws at this time. I think public awareness concerning seat belt safety for children and adults is strong and should be perpetuated. Most cars on the road today have subtle and not so subtle electronic reminders to put seat belts on. It also seems that traffic safety is better served through enforcing existing laws, such as, speed limits, DUI, reckless driving, obeying traffic signals and stop signs. With traffic laws so routinely violated, it seems we have ample opportunity to emphasize the importance of wearing seat belts through secondary enforcement.
\
21. Over the four years of your first term, how should Utah's tax structure be changed? What taxes cut? Should some be raised? What tax exemptions removed, changed or given? Is the overall tax structure fair, or is one segment -- individuals, families with children, businesses -- paying too much or too little?
\
I believe government has grown too quickly when measured by relevant benchmarks. For example, over the past decade government spending has exceeded both inflation and population growth.
\
I would approach limiting government growth and spending in two ways. First, establish a cap -- by constitutional amendment or otherwise -- that limits the amount of revenue the government can take and spend. Government revenues can be capped as a percentage of GDP or personal income or growth limited by the rate of inflation and population growth. The revenue cap should be set forth in a simple and clear manner such that all taxpayers and the government would know what to expect as taxes and revenue respectively. Second, we must settle on what government services are essential in today's world and set spending priorities to meet these needs. By focusing government on what Utahns most want from government and making sure those priorities are adequately funded, making cuts becomes easier. I also support setting up a strategic review commission, similar to President Ronald Reagan's ""Grace Commission,"" to review overall state spending and to make recommendations on priorities and the elimination of waste. I believe there could be found millions of dollars of savings to the state budget with this approach.
\
Through decades of ""horse trading,"" imbalances exist throughout the current system, which is why we need comprehensive review and revision of the tax system. I am concerned that the numerous deductions and exemptions that have crept into our system have operated as tax loopholes in a system that should be fair and impartial. Tax loopholes are subsidized by other taxpayers who support such recipients through higher taxes. The primary objective of a tax system should be aimed at producing the revenue to support necessary government services rather than income redistribution. As we review our tax structure, thought should be given to revising our income tax brackets to reflect the inflation from the time such brackets were first set. Our current bracket structure tends to place a disproportionate burden on lower income taxpayers. We should also give consideration to placing greater emphasis on fees for services used by taxpayers rather than having all taxpayers subsidize government services as the current system primarily does.
\
Utah's tax structure -- which has not been significantly modified in thirty years -- is ripe for review and revision. Currently a legislative task force, as well as, a panel appointed by Gov. Olene Walker and the Tax Commission, are assessing Utah's tax system and will make recommendations later this year. I hope to work with these committees and review their recommendations. I will also work with the Legislature, local government leaders, the business community and others, to determine the direction that we as a state should take on tax reform. I do support the elimination of the sales tax on food but with certain conditions being met first. Sales tax on food is one of the most regressive taxes in our society. It especially hurts seniors on fixed incomes and working families. With the seventh highest tax burden in the nation, we must find effective ways for reducing the tax burden on hard working families.
\
Eliminating the tax on food is the way to start. Eliminating sales tax on food is a matter of setting priorities. It can be done. Here's how: First, schools and local governments need to be held harmless from the tax cut. I will work with a team of mayors, county commissioners and city councils to ensure we do not burden communities with lost tax revenue.
\
Second, the tax should be removed from only staple food items, such as the foods that are covered under the food stamp program. This would represent the most regressive end of a regressive tax and would, therefore, not have the financial impact of eliminating the entire food tax. Simplifying the transition is that most grocery stores already have these types of foods segregated in their computer systems. Most prepared foods, ""junk"" food items, and the like, would not be exempted.
\
Third, the tax exemption would be phased in over the next four to five years, allowing for adjustment and adaptation by state and local governments. The elimination of the food tax also would be tied to a flow of new revenues from the capture of out of state sales tax from the interstate Streamline Sales Tax agreement. This new revenue flow would help to hold local governments harmless. (This also has the advantage of slowing growth of state government as the new ""windfall"" of money comes in.)
\
Fourth, as governor I will be reviewing a complete overhaul of our tax system and the tax on food exemption is only one part of that review process.
\
Fifth, we'll help to pay for the exemption like Ronald Reagan did to help pay for his tax cuts -- look at closing special interest loopholes.
\
22. The above questions are aimed at finding out where you stand; why primary voters should pick you. Can you give us one (or more) reasons why voters should not pick your primary opponent? For example, does he lack experience, education, vision, does he bring conflicts of interest or is he too closely associated with a minority wing of your party, is he more likely to lose in the final election, etc.?
\
I must first start by saying that I respect and admire my opponent. He has provided Utah with valuable service, both as a professional educator and in his public endeavors. Utahns have good choices before them and have not been prone to vote negatively in elections. In other words, Utahns do not select one candidate because they are not as bad as the other. I want to support voting as an affirmative choice, not a negative reaction trough the way my campaign moves forward. It is about discussing issues, finding solutions and presenting our positive message about ""A New Day for Utah."" I have faith that the voters here know that as well and will not base their vote upon a distaste for one candidate, but they will vote based upon preference for one candidate's vision, leadership ability and experience.
\
Utahns deserve a positive, issue driven campaign. I believe both myself, and Mr. Matheson, are committed to this concept. I see this election as a nice way to set the tone for dialogue for Utah's future elections. As the candidates tone down the rancor in their races, Utahn's can feel proud and confident in casting their vote.
"
187,"NEW YORK -- Somehow, someday, we're going to have to find a leader with the guts and the credibility to tell Americans the truth about energy: that our national dedication to cheap gasoline is leading us into a dead end. Economists are rightly calling this the silly season. And, indeed, both parties' panicked reactions to the temporary rise in gas prices are non-solutions to a non-problem.\Clinton opted to sell a tiny amount of oil from the strategic reserve at a nearly $90 million loss (administration slogan: Buy High, Sell Low). The Republicans leaped at the opportunity to raise both the budget and trade deficits by lowering the gas tax and thereby, with prices already up, to raise demand. One is tempted to recommend that the whole crew -- administration, House and Senate -- take a summer refresher course in Econ 1.\The truth is that it is always the silly season in this country when it comes to the price of oil and gasoline. Think about the past 15 years.\The Reagan administration, following budget director David Stockman's dictum that an energy policy only requires ``strategic reserves and strategic forces,'' relied on a free market that did not exist. The second term produced a spectacular 65 percent rise in oil imports.\The Bush administration labored for two years to produce an energy policy. Before sending it to Congress, the White House disemboweled it, removing all offending taxes and regulations, leaving a policy based on the fancy that we could drastically increase domestic production with low prices by showering tax breaks on the oil industry.\One had to delve deep into the fine print to discover that by ``low'' the administration meant $30 per barrel. It wouldn't have worked anyway, because White House ideologues ignored the geological fact that domestic oil was largely used up. Production outside Alaska had been declining for 20 years through two enormous price increases.\Congress spent another 20 months debating this mass of internal contradictions, eventually producing an 800-page bill. It, too, ignored the central issue of the relationship of price to demand and to energy productivity (another name for efficiency) in favor of dozens of peripheral issues. Unable to reach agreement on updating the single most important energy measure the country had taken -- namely the auto mileage standard known as CAFE, which was by then saving 2 million barrels per day -- Congress dropped it so it could pass the rest of the bill.\Neither the 1990 budget crisis nor the run up in price triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait could break the deadlock. For a while it seemed as though the country would swallow a significant tax in the name of deficit reduction, but no. All that the Persian Gulf crisis did was to reveal the depth of the president's antipathy to energy efficiency, the legacy of his years as an independent oil producer. After racing around in a gas-guzzling speedboat, Bush sneered at a suggestion that energy use should be addressed. With that leadership, progress was impossible.\Enter the Clinton administration, which needed revenues and ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A significant gas tax was ruled out because of a campaign commitment, and a lower BTU tax was proposed instead.\Environmentalists gave it only lukewarm support, and after furious lobbying, with every fossil fuel for itself, the Senate defeated what was left. Finally, to make up the remaining budget shortfall, an environmentally meaningless 4.3 cents-a-gallon gas tax was adopted, which is now on the chopping block.\On the path to a more sensible response, the first step is to remember that commodity prices naturally fluctuate. Six months ago gasoline costs were at a nearly 50-year low. The reasons for this spike include the long, cold winter and low inventories caused by buyers waiting for Iraq to re-enter the market. No collusion or price-gouging will be found. Crude prices are already on their way down. The lesson is to ignore short-term fluctuations, and let the market work.\Beyond that, our country has only two options. We can continue to have cheap gasoline -- in which case we must accept high levels of use, rising oil imports and a persistent trade deficit, and growing difficulty in achieving cleaner air, a workable transportation system and greenhouse gas limits.\The other option is to use price -- that is, energy taxes -- to induce technological advances and reduce demand.\We can attempt to avoid the ills of the low-price choice through strict fuel efficiency standards, but when the price and regulatory signals clash (cheap gasoline says mileage doesn't matter, CAFE says it does), the standards will be economically inefficient, hence unpopular and progressively weakened.\That's just what's happened. Automakers used a CAFE loophole to push growing numbers of light trucks -- minivans, pickups and so-called sport utility vehicles -- on which they make a larger profit.\Marketed as the perfect solution for heading vertically up muddy mountainsides or outrunning rhinoceroses, sports utility vans now account for 40 percent of new vehicle sales for a nation of commuters, delivering '70s era fuel mileage. Their growing role in the fleet is canceling out large efficiency gains cars have made. Higher speed limits make matters worse: fuel efficiency plummets between 55 mph and 75 mph.\Don't be falsely comforted by the length of time since the last energy crisis. We can't have everything -- cheap energy, ample supply, a safe environment and no intrusive regulation.\With 3 percent of world oil reserves, our underlying vulnerabilities have not changed. Nor, through more than 20 years, has our ability to think clearly about the price of gas. Cutting the gas tax would be just plain dumb.\----------\Jessica Mathews is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations"
188," AUSTIN -- One of the oldest rules in politics is ""Take half a loaf."" Politics is compromise: Every time you can get it, take half a loaf. When I was younger, that used to drive me nuts, and it still does on odd Tuesdays. In a contest between Right and Wrong, I could never see why anyone would settle halfway with Wrong.\ But the longer one watches politics, the more one notices it is less often a contest between Right and Wrong than a brawl among special interests. So entrenched are the special interests and special privileges in this society that any progress toward greater justice for all should be grabbed and relished. And then you come back and take another run at it. As they say in football circles, ""Hit 'em again, harder, harder."" The art of politics lies in hanging in over the long haul.\ Thus it is that I am prepared to celebrate even the weak and mild reforms in campaign financing the Senate passed in hope that the House may hit 'em harder. I'm already prepared, without having seen them, to cheer on Hillary Rodham Clinton's mild health-care reforms. (The American Medical Association hasn't waited to see the proposals either. It's already launched war-to-death against them.) If H. Clinton can get us halfway there, we can come back and take another run at a single-payer system farther on down the line.\ But all this hard-won wisdom -- either a symptom of maturity or of middle-age sloth -- is sometimes irrelevant and pernicious. A case in point is what the Senate has just done to Bill Clinton's tax package. This classic political compromise is not a case of half a loaf for the good guys. It is, in fact, a clear violation of another important political principle, The First Rule of Holes, which states, ""When you are in one, stop digging. Don't make it worse.""\ The particular hole in which we find ourselves is the gross maldistribution of wealth that is the chief legacy of the 1980s. Encouraged by ugly tax inequities, the upshot of the '80s was that the rich got obscenely richer, the poor got poorer and the middle class got squeezed. Bill Clinton's carefully crafted economic package began to redress those inequities. Then the Senate Finance Committee got hold of the package and marched militantly backward. Ah, but only halfway backward, say the spin doctors. Take half a loaf. Wrong. What we have here is a case of Still Digging.\ Look what they've done to Bill Clinton's song. First, they take out the broad-based Btu tax and substitute a pathetic 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax (remember Ross Perot calling for 50 cents a gallon?), which takes the energy tax revenue down from $72 billion in the House version to $24 billion in the Senate version. Where to find the $48 billion difference? The Senate whacked it out of Medicare, food stamps and tax credits for low-paid workers. Still digging. What they've done here is cut Clinton's plan to increase food stamps for poor families (undeterred by the new report last week on hunger in America, which, as always, affects children the most).\ Clinton also had a plan to extend tax credits to workers without children, who are currently ineligible for them. According to The New York Times, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has identified childless workers as the group hardest hit by federal tax increases over the past 15 years.\ Further, the effect of killing the Btu tax is to encourage us once again to be profligate with energy, killing off more of the environment, and to increase our dependence on Middle Eastern oil. I know you've heard this until you're ready to throw up, but Europeans pay as much as $3.65 a gallon in tax. American energy prices are the lowest in the industrial world.\ So with one stroke, the Senate Finance Committee reverses an intelligent step on energy policy and aggravates the unfairness of the tax system. And who was standing in the halls while this was going on? The lobbyists for the major energy-using industries, which we will continue to subsidize with our pennies at the gas pump.\ Which leads me to a new theorem (I've been hanging around with physicists lately) concerning the relationship between my two political rules. The Take-Half-a-Loaf Principle is related to the First Rule of Holes as follows: When you screw up campaign finance reform, you get the worst of both worlds. Until we get Congress off that big money-PAC teat, they're just going to keep digging, except only half as hard as before. Hole still gets deeper; we don't get even half a loaf of justice. There it is."
189,"Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman is back in the state after serving for two years as U.S. ambassador to Russia. But not only is Huntsman back home, he’s also running for his old job, announcing his gubernatorial campaign Thursday.\Earlier this week on the ‘Trib Talk’ podcast, Huntsman sat down with Tribune reporters Benjamin Wood and Bethany Rodgers to discuss his candidacy, and his position on a range of issues affecting Utah. The conversation was embargoed until he made his formal announcement.\A transcript of the conversation, edited for clarity and length, is included below. For the full interview, search for “Trib Talk” on SoundCloud, iTunes and Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Stitcher, Spotify and other major podcast platforms.\Benjamin Wood: Ambassador Jon Huntsman, thank you for joining us today. I’m Benjamin Wood from the Tribune and also with me is Bethany Rogers. To start off today, you’ve recently returned from Russia, which is in the center of all sorts of things happening right now. You’ve spoken to our colleagues in the Utah media about your concerns on the impeachment process. I believe you told the DNews that you’re worried about the rush to impeachment. Has your thinking changed at all or evolved at all as more information has come forward?\Jon Huntsman: No. First of all, I’m troubled, very troubled by the information that has come out with respect to a possible quid pro quo, particularly the work done by [Rudy] Giuliani. I don’t think that has any place in our foreign policy, particularly when you’re subcontracting out those kinds of communications that otherwise ought to be handled on a government to government basis.\We need to hear more. We need folks to come forward with information. We have a whistleblower. We have a statute that protects whistleblowers, that should be respected. We should collect the information, as we always do, in a transparent fashion. We should let the American people look and analyze that information and see where it leads us. But we’re just, I think, in the front end of a lot of this right now.\When I say rush to impeachment, what I would not want to see happen is for the impeachment process to become politicized. Now, when is it not? I mean, we’ve only had four of them in the history of our country. But my fear is that with an election, a national election less than a year away, why not let the people be the final arbiters, the final decision-makers on what they think, once all the information is brought forward?\I think that leaves us in a much better, sturdier position as a country with already a weakened political system because of the hyper polarity. That leaves us in a better place than an impeachment process that ultimately is going to veer toward politics. And people are going to see that. And so I think it just leaves us in a really bad place. If we didn’t have election a year out, maybe the answer would be different. But that’s kind of how I see it.\Benjamin Wood: You started with your concerns about the potential quid pro quo. If that were to be established in fact — that there was a this-for-that agreement, pressure placed on a foreign country asking for political aid — if that were to be established, would that rise to the level of impeachment in your mind?\Jon Huntsman: Well, time will answer that one. I think it’s too early to tell.\Benjamin Wood: And I’m not asking if you think that happened. But I’m saying if that were to have happened, would that be in the class of conversation [for impeachable crimes]?\Jon Huntsman: It depends what the totality of the action was. Was it a conversation and nothing more? Was it tied to the transfer of funds or ultimately military assets that actually were held up or not? We don’t know. At least I don’t know the answers to all of that.\So this is a complicated issue dealing with a complicated country with a newly elected president in a highly volatile part of the world, one where the United States has had an on-again-off-again relationship in recent years. And so there’s a lot that the American people are going to have to look at here, including not just the conversation, but the follow on actions, if there were, in fact, actions that took place. The totality of it.\Benjamin Wood: What do you make of the approach that our state’s federal delegation has taken on this topic? We see a range from Mitt Romney, who has expressed some criticisms, to Chris Stewart, who is a vocal supporter and defender of the president. What do you make of the way that our elected leaders are approaching this subject?\Jon Huntsman: Oh, I think they’re all approaching it in their own way, based upon their temperament, their approach to the administration, their relationship with President Trump. I think there are a lot of variables at play that put people where they are in this particular issue.\And that’s not surprising, because anytime you have something like this, you look back at a recent impeachment trials, whether it was Bill Clinton or whether it was Richard Nixon, our two most recent, and you’re going to find people who take different positions based on different motivations.\But there’s a lot yet to come. And I think the call for transparency, the call for all of the facts is probably the best thing that we can be doing right now in terms of what best serves our national interest.\Benjamin Wood: Our intelligence community has put forth that Russia engaged in an intentional and active campaign of meddling in the 2016 election. Do you see any reason to be skeptical of that conclusion and what do you think it means for 2020?\Jon Huntsman: I do believe they meddled. One of the first things I did when I got my security clearances, as I’ve had done a few times in my career, is to read the comprehensive report done by the intelligence community. Now, in this case, the intelligence community, the DNI, the director of national intelligence has about 17 or 18 component parts. Some of them are high profile and well-known to people like the FBI, the CIA, the National Security Agency. But then there are some smaller players.\It’s rare that they come forward with a consensus point of view. In this case, they came forward with a consensus point of view. So I say, OK, that means something to me. If you got the entire IC, intelligence community, that is saying the same thing, basically.\And so I sorted through the information and it was pretty clear to me that things took place that were aimed at taking us down, at weakening people and our political system. It’s also clear to me that this isn’t the first time they have done that. You can go back to the election of 1976 when Brezhnev supported Gerry Ford, because Gerry Ford was in favor of continuing an arms control negotiation, something that Russia, the Soviet Union then, saw as being in the national interest.\And maybe even before that. You go back 100 years ago to the fall of the Tsarist period and the rise of the communist period after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 and disinformation and spinning the truth and propaganda and malign activities in their particular neighborhood. None of this is new. This is a tool box that has existed for some time. And it’s a tool box that is only strengthening with technology that allows — whether the troll farms in St. Petersburg or whether their ability through the GRU, the intelligence arm of their military — to be very specific in identifying targets through cyber means and taking them down through disinformation, through propaganda and other malign efforts.\It’s not going to stop. They’re going to continue. Why? Because they want to see our country weakened. They want to exacerbate the extremes of our political divide. So when we have an incident based on race, a mass shooting, for example, some of the trolls that you see pop up and some of the Facebook messaging is not always from U.S. players. In some cases, they are from foreign players who are mimicking American citizens and trying to play into the extremes of our debates just to divide us further.\It’s a feature that has been a prominent part of their malign toolbox in recent years, and it ain’t going away. This will continue and will continue into the 2020 election.\My concerns are that the efforts could start playing out at a local election level. Imagine local elections where voter registration banks were tampered with, election results were changed, where on voter registration day, times of signing up or places where you could sign up was all of a sudden changed.\There are lots of ways to sort of trip up our process of democracy, and it all starts at the grassroots level, with getting people registered to vote [and] informed about the candidates. And these are all areas of real vulnerability for us.\Benjamin Wood: As you mentioned several times, we’re heading toward the next presidential election, that brings with it a lot of questions about security, about some of these topics. It also brings up the question of our current Republican president running for reelection. Do you have any take on whether or not you would support his reelection or endorse, or do you have any thoughts on his presidency yet to date?\Jon Huntsman: Well, he’s kept us out of war, where many upon his election or even in the run up to his election said that he would bring catastrophe after catastrophe on the world stage. I see a lot of disorder, but disorder is always a part of our global engagement and the way in which the world is transitioning, particularly following the Jasmine revolutions of 2007, 2008.\And he’s kept the economy strong, which I think a lot of voters are going to look at. So I think those are the two big things that people are going to really evaluate his presidency on.\He’s blustery, he’s bombastic, he’s outspoken. He tweets in ways that make a lot of people uncomfortable, including me. But in the end, I think they’re going to say, are we at war? OK. He’s trying to clean up the Middle East from a 20 year ongoing series of wars. That’s a good thing.\And the economy is doing better than a lot of people thought, particularly as it relates to minority populations that are seeing higher rates of job creation and job growth than we have since the 1960s.\So I think these all play to the benefit of Trump in a reelection and he’ll have to get through whatever the process is by the House of Representatives based on the approach to impeachment. And that may or may not trip him up. Hard to know. But in the case of Bill Clinton, after his [impeachment] was overturned in the Senate, it only strengthened the hands of his own party. And Newt Gingrich, who was the speaker of the House of Representatives, will tell you that chapter and verse. So you have to approach the impeachment process during an election year, I think, very carefully.\Benjamin Wood: We’d like to pivot to more local issues but before we do, anything we haven’t talked about on the federal, national level of anything you care to follow up on before we transition?\Jon Huntsman: It’s a complicated and confusing world right now. The thing I walked away from most as I did from China, when I saw President Obama, is there’s still only one superpower in the world.\There are a couple of great powers and among them are China and Russia. But there’s only one superpower. And we are so dramatically ahead in terms of the areas that really matter in terms of national power, whether that is our economic performance, whether it’s our national defense, whether it’s our ability to create and sustain a self-sustaining civil society. I hope that lasts. That’s the most important thing that we have. And our soft power, which no other country even comes close to. Our ability to write the lyrics that everybody sings and reads around the world. Still, these are very prominent features of our national power. And I just don’t see another rival emerging on the world stage with the exception of China. And they’ve got their own challenges around the bend.\Bethany Rodgers: I guess the one follow up question that I would have before we transition is, what was your sense of the international sentiment toward the U.S. and toward President Trump? Did it change over the time that you were abroad?\Jon Huntsman: Well, I’ve seen the sentiment ebb and flow. I saw the sentiment when I worked for George W. Bush, who was widely reviled by Europe for his declarations of war in the Middle East. We were probably trading at an all time low in terms of our reputation and respect, mostly among our European partners and allies and friends who really should have stepped up and done more.\So I saw that as a low point. I see today still some concerns about the uncertainty surrounding U.S. policy. And in some areas, the president has hit Europe hard on things like living up to 2 percent of their GDP spent on national defense, which is really one of the goals of NATO membership among the 29 NATO countries.\I think that has created some some concern because there’s been lip service that’s been paid for decades now around that. And the president’s really tried to push some of the members on that. So there’s a little bit of backlash as far as that goes.\The trade war with China, I mean, where even to start on that. He’s taken on some issues that the past two or three presidents could have taken on, easily, but didn’t because of the political difficulty in calling the Chinese out on things like intellectual property theft and basic market access issues and indigenous innovation issues, picking winners, which they’re doing at the expense of U.S. competition within the marketplace.\So the world’s a complicated place and in the end, there is still enormous respect for the U.S. system, which transcends any one politician. And that’s our civil society, our values — that still really are sought after in a big part of the world, although you don’t hear about that a lot — and still our willingness to expend national resources to protect those who are being bullied abroad.\These things are still respected and the U.S. is still very much a leader in that regard.\Benjamin Wood: Let’s talk about Utah. We appreciate your time and we appreciate your willingness to chat with us on an embargoed basis. Listeners, just so you’re aware, we’re speaking on Monday and this episode likely will not be released for a few days. I can’t say for sure exactly when you’re hearing it.\There had been rumors swirling for the last several weeks about first, your return to the state in general and then, secondly, the potential for another run for governor.\There’s been this question out there among people who wonder why, who, for lack of a better phrase, think that Utah might be small potatoes for a man of your international and national reputation. And I think that’s kind of the first question we had, is why after after being ambassador, after running for president, after everything you’ve done, including being the governor of the state of Utah, why run again for governor?\Jon Huntsman: Well, first of all, this has always been our home. And so, of course, we’re going to return to where we have a home and have always been residents and will be for generations.\If you have a love for the state, as I do, as my family does, and if you want to see it survive the challenges of the future, and if there is an open seat in 2020, which there is, and if you feel that you helped to get the state in part to where it is today in areas around economic development, education, the environment and other areas, then you have to conclude — I have to conclude by saying we’re not done.\I think this state is just getting going. I really do. And if you have some ideas about where things could be improved and you’re not willing to put your voice forward, then I say, as someone who has been committed to public service a good part of my life, that I would be a lesser person for not wanting to stand up and do something about it.\Why governor? Because it’s the best job in the world. And I know that because I’ve done it. It’s a job that’s given to you by the people. And they put great faith and trust in you as governor. They afford you great leeway to do things. They want to know that you’re out looking out for the future, looking around the bend, anticipating risk and looking out for the next generation of Utahns, kids and grandkids. And you feel that when you’re governor.\It’s an awesome, awesome place to be. And in the public service experiences I’ve had — and again, they’ve been international and they’ve been here domestically — there hasn’t been an honor as great as serving the people of Utah.\Benjamin Wood: Well, you touched on a lot of topics there, some that we do want to return back to. But just to kind of set this up, we’d like to cover a wide range of things and we’ll be going back and forth a little bit. I’ll essentially get out of Bethany’s way for a minute and we’ll just see what we can cover in the time that we have.\Bethany Rodgers: To follow up on what you just said. I’m wondering if you feel like you have, I guess, the pulse of Utah having been away for a bit. Do you feel like you have your arms around what’s going on in the state at this point?\Jon Huntsman: You never leave. You read every day. You stay in contact? You return. But if you’re as invested as we were as governor before [we were] called off to go to China, you never leave those issues, they stay with you.\And maybe not too surprising. The issues are still with us today. I look at the headline issues and a lot of them are still based upon the issues that we focused on and tried to find solutions for and in some cases found some pretty good solutions and maybe a bit of updating is required. But no, you never lose your connectivity with the great state of Utah.\Benjamin Wood: Do you intend to gather signatures under SB54?\Jon Huntsman: Yes, we do.\Benjamin Wood: And what do you make of that whole discussion? It’s been a lingering debate for several years. What do you make of the transition and the new way that we’re nominating people for their party primary?\Jon Huntsman: Well, it’s run its course. It’s gone through the court system. It’s been debated for some time. I think you still need to pay respects to those who participate at the caucus levels, who turn out and run for state delegate.\I’ve been to countless of those cottage meetings where people run to be a state delegate and then they gather at the state convention. I think that’s still an important part of the process. And we would fully intend as a candidate to be part of that process, to visit as many delegates as we can. Just like we did last time. I’ve been through it twice.\The signature gathering is something that obviously is new. And I think all candidates are going to do that. It would probably be malpractice from an insurance standpoint not to do that. But that isn’t saying that you give short shrift to delegates and people who work the grassroots level. That’s the heart and soul of either one of the parties.\Bethany Rodgers: I wanted to ask you about the ongoing tax reform effort and the state considering a lot of options for rebalancing revenue streams. One of the things that’s currently on the table, as you know, is taxing food at the full sales tax level. Knowing that you tried to bring down the sales tax on food, what is your perspective of this effort and in particular, the food tax?\Jon Huntsman: Well, we not only tried to take it down, we did. And I think that was a very good thing. And there’s an economic argument. But there’s also a moral argument to be made that I think compels me and that compelled a lot of legislators at the time.\We took an old, more antiquated, system, which was a more progressive taxation system that had six tiers to it and probably a high rate of 7 percent. But when fully loaded, probably closer to 10. And I was compelled to move toward a flatter tax for purposes of competitiveness.\So as I went around, you know, doing the diligence before I ran in ’04 and then after I was elected, talking to people, what is most important for the state in terms of maintaining our competitiveness, given the levers that you really control. And the things that took us in that direction were, for example, the outflow of brainpower.\Why do we raise and educate kids here, the best and brightest, and they go somewhere else to make their dreams come true? That, to me, was not right. And we needed more of an environment that kept people here, which is to say more opportunity. Well, more opportunity usually comes in the form of more jobs and economic pursuits. In order to get that, you had to bring in more investment. In order to get more investment, you had to have a more attractive environment.\So for me, the 10-point plan that we created in ’04 was exactly to address our competitive needs. Because if we did that right, then education would benefit, transportation would benefit and families would benefit because people would have more choices to stay here as opposed to fleeing to Maricopa County or Clark County or Denver, which a lot we’re doing.\And it’s like, OK, so we raise them, we pay for their education, they say goodbye to their families. That’s just not right. We need to keep them here.\So we did in the old tax system, this was ’06 and ’07, started with a special session and then went beyond. And it was our first flat tax of its kind in the country. And people at the beginning said, ‘no way you get it done.’ And we said, ‘well, with the right kind of coalition, we can get it done.’ And we did.\And as part of that overall effort, we took the rate down to just slightly below 5 percent and did a little bit of work on the sales tax, particularly the sales tax coming off of food, which I thought was a really important thing to do. And I still believe that it’s an important thing to do.\It means a lot to families who in many cases can barely get by. And there’s nothing more basic than food for families. So I think that’s something that needs to stay where it is going forward. And I do believe that we have a tax structure that when you stack it up to other states is probably in the top 10, 15 states in terms of best practices. Sales tax, no, I think that’s one area where we lack and that’s going to need some work.\Income tax, it’s a best practices state. Business tax, it’s best practices. Property tax, it’s OK. And I’m referring to Tax Foundation analysis of all the 50 states. Sales tax is going to need, I think, a little bit of work. And therein lies the challenge.\So how do you broaden a base that used to be a whole lot more, consumer driven, consumer purchases of goods, and now it’s more and more services, maybe, I don’t know, 65 percent where it was maybe 50 percent in earlier years. How do you deal with that diminution of revenue? How do you make up for it in a way that is fair, by broadening the base? Any tax policy wants to begin by broadening a base and then applying a rate to that base. It’s hard to rely on a base that continues to shrink. And you have to say, why is it shrinking and what can be done in order to broaden that base and to make sure that all the bills are paid for.\So that takes us to a tax reform today. And I’m not quite sure where it’s going, but something will have to be done as it relates to the sales tax generally. But it has to be done in a way that really takes into account small businesses, which are the majority of job creators in the state. Some of them who can ill afford more bureaucratic efforts and higher costs.\So I would love it if we could still move toward a postage stamp [tax return]. You know just an envelope, if you will, size tax return. I think that still should be our goal. And it was our goal back when we started tax reform, which was the last time taxes really were tackled in the state.\There’s still some updating and maintaining that we can do in this drive for an ever more competitive state, because if we sleep on all those around us in our neighborhood, you better believe they’re sharpening their knives and trying to figure out how they can steal jobs from us and investment and become better at the economic development game.\Benjamin Wood: What do you make then of the proposal to amend the Constitution and do away with the income tax earmark so that can be spent on things that aren’t public education?\Jon Huntsman: I don’t have a position on that right now. I think first and foremost, as we look at the budget as I used to look at the budget, it was usually what do we do about public ed? That’s always thought No. 1. Now it’s a big percentage of our $18, $19 billion budget.\I think it’s probably time that we look more creatively at how we fund education. I think coming from the [Education] fund, as it has been, as earmarked by the Constitution, is important. But are there things additive that we can do for public education that we haven’t thought of before?\I’m not against looking for new revenue streams that will bring additional support to education. But when we talk about support for education, the [weighted pupil unit] that drives funding for students is one thing. Compensation for teachers is another that really is of interest to me.\I don’t know if you were reporting back in the days when we tried to get the highest level of compensation to teachers as part of our overall tax reform package earlier on. And we did that for a reason. I believe that we ought to get the best and the brightest in education. And part of it is when somebody is born to be an educator, as my grandfather was, no place will make them happy outside the classroom. I mean, they’re just born to do that. So that’s one part of it.\People want to be educators and we’re grateful for that. But there is a compensation part of it, too. They ought to be compensated fairly and we ought to have the compensation such that it does attract people who might drift off into some other line of work because we need the best and the brightest in the classroom for the next generation of Utahns.\Bethany Rodgers: Another piece of the tax reform discussion has been about transportation funding, about how the gas tax isn’t fully keeping up with the needs for infrastructure in the state. The task force right now is thinking about applying that sales tax to gas purchases. They’ve also discussed some sort of vehicle miles traveled initiative. And they’ve talked about the feasibility of toll roads.\All of those things have been kind of ideas floating out there. Do you have a position at this point on anywhere else to go for transportation funding?\Jon Huntsman: Same stuff that we’ve been talking about for a long time. Same thing. Just like on education. You know, a lot of this doesn’t change.\One thing I do know, if we get behind on transportation in terms of growth, we’re never going to catch up. You become a Maricopa County. You remember when Phoenix built their rail system, their light rail system when they had reached, I don’t know, maybe 5 million in size. They had just overtaken Philadelphia as the fifth largest city in the country. And the disruption and cost associated with doing something late in the game as opposed to ahead of time was hurtful, I think, to their overall economy and mobility.\So transportation is something that we have to stay on the cutting edge of. We can never fall behind the growth curve as it relates to transportation, which means all options have to be on the table. I’m not wedded to upping the gas tax. I don’t think that I’m ready to say anything on that front yet.\But I do think we need to look at all options for getting people around. And that includes walking, running, bikes, scooters, all forms of transportation. It includes ride-sharing that some cities and urban areas are looking at. So there are a lot of things that we can do that we ought to be looking at. But first and foremost, we can’t fall behind the growth curve as it relates to transportation.\Benjamin Wood: Should Utah host another Olympics?\Jon Huntsman: I think it’s worth considering. I wasn’t a huge proponent of the last one, just with concerns about what it might do to the canyons, from an environmental degradation standpoint. I was also a little concerned about creating jobs that were really temporary.\I was hard pressed to find any location that had hosted the Winter Olympics that actually benefited from a job creation standpoint. The jobs come and then they go, so how do you make it a sustainable effort? Moreover, most places outside of the United States and even some in the United States are able to pay for their Olympic costs and expenditures through government coffers, through travel and tourism budgets, stuff like that. We don’t do that.\So I think we have to be mindful of the budget, the economics, the environmental degradation and what you do with the infrastructure once it’s up and running.\I remember shortly after my election, I got the balance sheet on the infrastructure that we had built in ’02 and those were just a couple of years later. You get a luge run and, you know, slalom stuff and the giant ski jump facility. We have to maintain that, it has got to be maintained. Well, it costs money and you don’t have a whole lot of users for that.\So then you have to make a business model out of what you have. You bring in the professional sports organizations, you weave it into a travel tourism kind of design. So those are just right off the top of my head, you know, some concerns. Now, the positives are huge. And that is there are a few things in the world like the 14 or 15 day platform that you get in terms of projecting your community, your state, your culture to the rest of the world.\It’s a big deal. And I think we’ve benefited from that when we had the Olympics last time. So I think it’s an important conversation for people to have. And I would be neutral to positive about having it again.\Bethany Rodgers: Do you believe that human activity is a significant factor in a changing climate?\Jon Huntsman: I do believe that we are having an effect on the climate patterns, human activity in all of its forms and I think that’s been established by science. The question then becomes, well, what do you do about it and how can you address things like air quality and issues that become as much health related as they are pertinent to the environment?\And that’s where I think we find ourselves now in the Wasatch Front. I was down meeting with some entrepreneurs just recently in Lehi, a lot of the tech entrepreneurs. That’s an issue for them now in Utah Valley. So when they bring people to try to recruit talent, there are some months during the year that you just don’t want to do that. So that becomes an issue that we have to really think carefully about. It’s a health issue. It’s an environmental issue. And we have to be mindful, always, that we’re downstream, always downstream.\So we can do so much and then stuff blows our way, even from the factories of China and India. It gets in the jetstream. I’m talking more about pollutants, particulate matter, PM 2.5 stuff as opposed to the climate concerns, that ends up on the doorstep of California and then ultimately into the Wasatch Front. So this is a global issue, truly.\Benjamin Wood: I want to ask you about Medicaid and marijuana. We had two initiatives where the voters approved a particular approach. The Legislature repealed those approaches, put in their own plans and then those legislative plans suffered some defeats. And we’ve landed somewhere in the middle on both topics.\I’m curious what you think of where Utah is now on Medicaid and marijuana, and your thoughts on the Legislature repealing something that’s been approved by a majority vote?\Jon Huntsman: On the Medicaid front, we have to figure out how to cover families that are caught in between. And that was something we tried very hard to do the last go around by getting affordable, accessible, portable insurance policies, which is really, in a sense, the heart of the matter, because that’s the heart of medical spending, which is a hugely costly undertaking.\So if you can’t get coverage, if you can’t get insurance coverage for basic and even critical care, you’re in a really bad place. I believe it starts with an affordable, accessible insurance policy, which we worked very hard to get and we had some success on, but we just don’t have enough of it today.\We need to do something desperately soon with the insurance companies to see why we’re not getting more affordable, accessible and portable insurance policies that can cover all segments of the population. So on one hand, it’s the federal government and, you know, it’s reimbursements on Medicaid and who qualifies at the relative levels of poverty, because each state will kind of approach it a little differently.\That discussion will continue and should. But I think the bigger issue is what are we doing to fix it at a local level in terms of basic costs for health care? And costs are skyrocketing double digit year over year. Pharmaceutical costs are a big part of that and insurance costs are a big part of that.\We can come up with solutions that address some of these areas for people who are falling through the cracks. And we have a big uninsured population, to be sure. Not as big as the nation does, but we have a big population and it’s mostly the young, immortal population, 18 to 35 or 40 years old. We’re never going to die. And even if we wanted insurance, there is nothing we can afford.\Well, that needs to be fixed. And I think we have a role to play at a local level, ultimately, in doing that.\Benjamin Wood: And marijuana?\Jon Huntsman: Well, I think there’s an argument to be made about medical marijuana. I think that the people of the state saw that, and that’s why it led to the initiative. And I think we’re probably just on the front end of the medicinal value of things that we maybe didn’t appreciate before, that for those who suffer, may have some benefits.\I don’t think we know a lot about it. But I think there is something here that is worth pursuing. Now, when you’re in pain and when you’re suffering you see the world a little differently. And I’m reflecting on a family member who went through a lot of pain and suffering recently. And he talked about medical marijuana and said, how could anyone stand up and oppose something that would help those who were suffering grievous pain and a diminished quality of life. And I tend to agree with that.\Benjamin Wood: And I do want to make sure I double up on that political question, too. So the repeal efforts by the Legislature, those are bills that land on the governor’s desk. Moving forward, we’ve already seen interest in various other initiatives, there’s one on a carbon tax that’s percolating at the moment. In the event that you find yourself in the governor’s mansion and the Legislature repeals a voter approved initiative, is that good politics? Is that appropriate?\Jon Huntsman: I don’t think it’s good public policy. I think this is where a governor should stand up between the Legislature and the people who have maybe chosen to go in a different direction and to, in a sense, reconcile some of the differences.\I think that’s what leadership is. And that’s what I think a governor should do in a situation like this. The people feel one way, the Legislature — closer to the issues and maybe to the nuances of how the sausage is made from a public policy standpoint — feel differently. Well, somebody’s got to stand in the breach and reconcile those differences. Otherwise, you know, you have an open wound, as we seem to have today.\Bethany Rodgers: I want to ask you about the issue of conversion therapy. There was a bill this last session to ban conversion therapy for underage children. And now after the failure of that bill, the governor directed an administrative process to develop rules to do the same thing.\The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints has come out opposed to the current version of the rules as drafted and have requested either significant changes or that the issue be returned to the Legislature. Do you support the rule as written? And if not, why?\Jon Huntsman: I’ll have to read up on the rule itself, but I think conversion therapy largely has been proven to be junk science. And I think the scientific community, those who are close to issues pertaining to gender and sexuality would probably say that there is not a lot there that proves that there is efficacy in using that approach.\More than that, I think it’s harmed a lot of people for life. And I think this is something we should straight up put behind us.\Benjamin Wood: Should Utah’s state flag be redesigned?\Jon Huntsman: I kind of like the way it is. We have our state symbol, which is actually enshrined in the state’s constitution. It has our motto, which is Industry, which I love, on the beehive. And it’s in a lovely blue field. I think it’s a very attractive flag. Now, I’m not an expert at this kind of thing.\Benjamin Wood: Do you think you could pick it out of a lineup if it was far away?\Jon Huntsman: I could, absolutely, and I do all the time. In your places that’s flying all 50 states, I can pick it out in a second. I think it’s actually pretty good. I wouldn’t expend a whole lot of effort trying to redesign it.\Bethany Rodgers: We’ve also heard Sen. Dan McCay has plans to sponsor legislation that would basically ban all elective abortions in the state. Meanwhile, there’s also legislation in the courts right now over the abortion bill that was passed by the Legislature this last session. Would you support a measure of the sort that Senator McCay is talking about and what are your views about how abortion should be regulated here in the state?\Jon Huntsman: I don’t like abortion. I would prefer adoption. It is a law of the land and until such time as that is overturned, it remains the law of the land. With regard to the specifics of his legislation, I’ll have to delve into that at the appropriate time. But this has come up repeatedly over the years, the same kind of thing.\And although it’s taken flight in some states, at some point the courts are going to have to step in and probably reconcile some of the differences. And I suspect that’s where the issue is headed for the most part.\Benjamin Wood: But if I could follow up, do you think that Utah should be engaged in poking at that court precedent, as some of our lawmakers are suggesting?\Jon Huntsman: Well, whether I think it’s appropriate or not it will happen, and it will happen as far as the eye can see into the future, because this is a hot-button issue. It’s a life and death issue. It’s one that polarizes people, so it’s going to be of interest to the media, to special interest groups. And it’s going to be something people talk about because there’s passion on both sides.\So the courts are going to ultimately, probably weigh in, probably in the next round or so, as they have in the past. And I think that’s probably the route this continues to take until Roe v. Wade is overturned. And I’m not sure I’ll live long enough to see that happen.\Benjamin Wood: A large portion of Salt Lake City has been set aside for the development of an inland port. I’m curious what you make of that project in general and also the approach the Legislature took in claiming authority over that area.\Jon Huntsman: The inland port concept has been talked about at least since the 1970s, and it’s what to do with vacant land out just west of the airport. And it’s now some warehousing space, Amazon has a million square foot facility out there.\You’ve got rail lines that are predominantly used by Union Pacific that make it a very good access point for goods coming in and coming out. It’s also when you look at rail, a pretty clean form of transporting goods, probably the cleanest form of all.\So could you turn that area into a vibrant transport center, that would be a part warehousing, part services, part manufacturing? I think inevitably that’s what happens. If you didn’t want to do it there, maybe you do it in the Tooele Valley.\But we are situated geographically in such a prime position and we are growing so rapidly as an economy that we are a natural hub for goods coming and going, goods where value added is made, goods that will be manufactured here, goods that will be warehouse and stored here. And that’s going to give rise to all of the allied services, whether it’s financial, whether it’s accounting, legal, logistics. These are all going to be part of it as well.\I think it can be done in ways that take into account the concerns that some have expressed with respect to the environment — where you put it, how you build it, who is co-located with it, the forms of transportation that have access to it. All of this has to be part of a master plan, ultimately.\And I think it’s a down payment long term on where our economy goes. I think ultimately it happens. I’m not quite sure where the location might be. I have my own thoughts on that, but I think this will be part of our future.\As it relates to governance, when are you not going to see city and state governments going at each other over structuring the right and appropriate governance process for something like this? That will continue. With a new mayor, I think we’ll probably see this evolve a little differently, maybe with less volume, and we’ll have to see what happens at the state level as well.\But ultimately to make this work, state and city governments are going to have to work together on the governance side. And they’re going to have to anticipate all the issues that already are out there in the public domain and make sure that the public feels good about it.\Bethany Rodgers: So just as a follow up, did you say that you have in mind alternative locations for the inland port to what’s currently in place?\Jon Huntsman: Well, we have something that’s already currently in place. You know, when I look at the 50 to 100 year horizon here in the state, I say at some point, Tooele Valley is going to come into its own. It’s going to be a second Salt Lake Valley. And wherever the inland port is situated in right now, we already have a geographical location that has been partially built out. It’s going to attract a lot of business and it’ll become a vibrant part of our Wasatch Front.\And so whether there or whether we’re looking longer term at maybe sharing some of that with an adjacent county, because based on growth, every county around Salt Lake and Utah counties is feeling that pressure — whether it’s Juab County, whether it’s Summit County, whether it’s Tooele — everyone’s feeling that pressure that’s emanating from growth on the Wasatch Front.\And we ought to think long term about how this is situated and where we want our growth patterns to exist over the next 50 to 100 years. But this comes from my earlier involvement as chair of Envision Utah. When you’re forced to look at the developable land that we’ve got, which isn’t much, and how we best utilize it going forward.\When you add another million people, as we’re about to do over the next decade, how do you shoehorn them in while maintaining quality of life, clean air, water and educational access? All this stuff is really complicated when you start adding another million people. So I think it behooves us all to think long term about how we want this densely populated metropolitan area to evolve.\And now you’ve got Washington County that is growing in a similar fashion and they’ll have the same kinds of challenges.\Bethany Rodgers: On the current transition in homeless services from the closure of The Road Home to the three new resource centers, we’ve been seeing lately some concerns over available capacity in those three new resource centers. Do you approve of the way that the state is handling those capacity concerns at this point?\Jon Huntsman: I’m not going to criticize the state, far be it for me to do that. All I can say is we did our best to eradicate homelessness when I was governor before and we came pretty close to doing that. And we did it by making it as much a humanitarian effort as anything else, realizing that you were dealing with addiction, you were dealing with some mental illness issues, people who, through no fault of their own, had fallen through safety nets in society, and most of whom wanted to get back on their feet. And that required the dignity of housing.\And so in the end, I look less at how do we deal with the cold night tonight and tomorrow night, because we have facilities that can handle that. And we’ll debate that forever as to what should be open and closed. The bigger issue is how do we bring an end to this and how do we address the underlying root causes of homelessness?\It isn’t all based on economics. When we had earlier presidential administrations, people would always blame the bad economy for homelessness. That’s part of it, but the economy is good here. We’re fully employed. So you have to look beyond just the economic, beyond the economics of homelessness, at what some of the underlying drivers are and then sort of match some of those drivers with solutions.\And I really do believe that finding transitional opportunities for the homeless, finding ways in which we can address addiction and ultimately, long term, the mental health issues that underlie a lot of this, which we know so little about — I hope we know more in the years and the decades ahead — that’s where I think our focus really needs to be. It’s how we transition people toward dignity. Get them off the streets where it becomes more of a lawless environment, where you find more drugs and violence. That’s what we’ve experienced the last little while. We’ve got to get more people working toward a transitional plan that gets them back on their feet.\Benjamin Wood: Your last lieutenant governor was Gary Herbert, our current governor. Is there anyone that you have in mind for a potential running mate? And for voters who are perhaps a little worried that you might be invited to be an ambassador again or another position in the national, international community, do you expect to finish your term if elected?\Jon Huntsman: Well, that’s a perfectly legitimate point. And I would ask it too. No, I’m not going anywhere. I’ve done my service and I’m proud to have done my service to two parties and different presidents. But it was a really tough call. And we can maybe take another time when what do you want to discuss it, what goes through the thought process when a president asks you to do something and you’ve got a commitment of this kind. You’re serving a state. You’ve been reelected. There’s a lot underway, a lot happening. And you have to make a call.\I don’t regret any of that. But I’m here to tell you, I’m not going anywhere. I’m proud of our service. I’m proud of what I did here as governor. This is our future here.\And I’m not much into the national political scene. I’ve been there. I’ve tried it. It’s a lot of wasted time, a lot of theatrics and kicking up dust and not a lot of effort that goes into problem solving, which is what I like, and preparing communities for the future. We’re here and and we’re not going anywhere.\In terms of possible lieutenant governor choices, I was greatly benefited to have Gary as as a lieutenant governor. We were friends. I used to tease him that he could interpret my English in Utah County and I could interpret his English in the rest of the state. And we had a good, division of labor. We worked well together. And I think he’s done a fine job in the intervening years. Where we go on that decision, we’ll just have to wait and see.\Bethany Rodgers: That kind of segued into the last question that at least I have. How would you grade your former lieutenant governor as governor?\Jon Huntsman: I don’t give out grades. I think that’s unfair. I wouldn’t give out a grade on myself either. But I would say he’s been a very, very dedicated governor and one who I can proudly say has taken the best of what we tried to do and kept it going and added to it where he thought it was appropriate.\Benjamin Wood: Obviously, there’s a long time to go before the election, but as things currently stand, it does appear that you’re in a top tier with Spencer Cox as a potential opponent, which is somewhat interesting in that you are Gov. Herbert’s predecessor, Spencer Cox is his current lieutenant governor. Some might view that as a natural succession, or at least in the current administration’s mind.\So for voters who are looking at this race and they’re seeing a choice between you and Spencer Cox, both men who have orbited the same kind of sphere, what case do you make to them?\Jon Huntsman: Well, I think ultimately people are going to look at experience, because past performance in the job is generally an indication of where things are going to go into the future.\We were the first statewide official to win all 29 counties. And I think that was based on a lot of hard work and a collaborative environment that we created across the partisan divide, just working to do the right thing for the people of the state. And a lot of those same issues are still with us.\I think folks are going to say, who is best equipped to address those issues based upon where they’ve been? Who’s best positioned to address our place in the world, which is going to become more and more problematic, because we’re competing not just against Nevada and Arizona and Colorado and California, we’re competing against Singapore and Hong Kong and South Korea.\And I think they’re going to say, who is best prepared to deal in an increasingly tumultuous national environment, which I think I understand pretty well, too. And who’s best positioned to see around the bend, to anticipate the challenges and to come up with public policy solutions that will protect our kids and our grandkids.\We’ve gladly had the privilege of being in that seat before. And I think we’ve proven what we can do. And we’d be greatly honored and humbled to be able to do it again.\Benjamin Wood: As a last question, I want to make sure that we acknowledge this is a somewhat delicate interview in that your brother, Paul Huntsman, is the owner and publisher of The Salt Tribune.\Jon Huntsman: Yes.\Benjamin Wood: The Salt Lake Tribune has recently been approved for a nonprofit status, but we have not yet gone through that transition. I would just be curious to ask you what you perceive as your relationship with the Tribune.\Jon Huntsman: Same as it has always been. I got your endorsement two election cycles in a row. I would not accept an endorsement today.\Benjamin Wood: Luckily, we can’t even give them out anymore.\Jon Huntsman: You don’t give them out and I wouldn’t take it if you could. But I see it as no change at all. None.\Benjamin Wood: Well, former governor, Ambassador Jon Huntsman, thank you so much for being on “Trib Talk.”\Jon Huntsman:  Ben, Bethany. It’s been a pleasure to be with you. Thanks for your time.\Crédito: By The Salt Lake Tribune"
190,"With gas dropping below $1.50, we're in danger of returning to our old gas-guzzling ways that hurt America's trade deficit and the environment. Here's what President Barack Obama and the new Congress should do.\For the next three years, gradually raise our gasoline tax by a penny a week. That would maintain the incentive to drive less and smarter and to buy fuel-efficient cars. The money from the tax should be funneled back to taxpayers in ways that will help Americans pay a smaller gas tax. I propose two methods.\First, some of the money should help construct mass transit. That will take people off the roads. Second, give a substantial rebate for buying a fuel-efficient or alternate-fuel car; the higher the mpg, the bigger the rebate. That would not only help people save fuel, but it would constructively jump-start the ailing auto industry in a way that nudges it to make better cars. The rebates would also help save American auto-manufacturing jobs by increasing buyer demand instead of just subsidizing failed automakers.\Within a decade, this program alone would change our automobile habits.\Neil McCormick\Salt Lake City\Credit: Public Forum Letter"
191,"
Charles Krauthammer and Thomas Friedman do not exactly share political views, yet both agree raising the gas tax would be beneficial both to the country and individuals in the long run.
\
A recent Readers' Forum letter giving practical reasons as to how folks across the pond cope with high gas prices was very instructive.
\
Regardless of those playing the market -- supply and demand, gas-guzzling cars and our ""friends"" holding back on drilling/production of crude, together with those so obsessed with the environment -- we as daily drivers must look to ourselves and be more efficient in our usage of this precious commodity.
\
Our political leaders of both parties need to assert some statesmanship, step up to to plate, bite the bullet and tell America, we need to hike the cost of gas until we find the price point, a good start to hopefully changing our car-buying and driving habits.

192,"The proposed gas tax holiday is not only a bad idea - it's a joke. Analysts say it will save the average American perhaps $30 over the summer, yet it will cost our government almost $10 billion in revenue earmarked for federal highway programs.\Are we naive enough to believe Americans will actually drive less this summer thanks to a gas tax holiday?\I recently met a fellow who commutes daily from Springville to 1700 South in Salt Lake City. ""How can you stand that?"" I asked. He said he and his wife had considered living closer to his work, but she just really liked Springville, so they live there. Until we start driving less, Americans will continue to be the gas hogs of the free world.\Perhaps a higher tax on gas is what we really need - like Europe. Then we would start to make choices that reduce our driving, not increase it. We would buy gas-saving smaller cars, pollute the environment less and develop more mass transit. I wonder what Europeans think of John McCain's gas tax holiday idea? They're probably guffawing.\Rick Hymer\Herriman\Credit: Public Forum Letter"
193,"I find myself longing for the good old days when political leaders found a way to effectively address issues that were in the national interest. Nearly 60 years ago, while the nation was still paying down the debt from World War II, Congress passed and President Eisenhower signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. Over the next 50 years the interstate highway system grew to 46,876 miles at a cost of $129 billion.\The federal government established the technical standards of the system and provided 90 percent of the cost from a fuel tax. The states provided the remaining 10 percent. The project took years to get through the Congress. It was very controversial at the time but our political system functioned. As we struggle to maintain and improve the system today, we hear echoes of many of the same arguments from years ago opposing the effort.\More information on the history of the project is available by searching the Internet for ""Ike's Interstate at 50.""\Contrast that political achievement with our attempts this year to adequately fund the Highway Trust Fund.\The current federal gas tax of 18.4 cents per gallon has remained unchanged since 1993. Revenue has been eroded 39 percent by inflation during that time. In addition, we are driving more fuel-efficient vehicles and driving fewer miles, further reducing revenues as the maintenance needs of the infrastructure are increasing.\The Obama administration proposed a $302 billion four-year program to provide some stability and reduce uncertainties for planners. That plan avoids raising the gas tax and relies on tolls and tax code reforms (gimmicks) for revenue.\Republican Sen. Bob Corker and Democratic Sen. Christopher Murphy have proposed a more sensible plan of raising the federal gas tax by 12 cents over the next two years. Then, by indexing the tax to the Consumer Price Index, we would eliminate the Highway Trust Fund shortfall by raising $164 billion over 10 years. But that is not possible in an election year since the voters might be displeased.\Failure to act now will result in an infrastructure spending reduction of 28 percent starting in August, risking the loss of 700,000 badly needed jobs.\The House passed a stopgap bill recently by a bipartisan vote of 367-55. The administration is supporting it reluctantly, and the Senate passed it by a vote of 81-13 just before members left town for a five-week vacation. This plan will provide funding for 10 months.\It raises $10.9 billion by taking money from a fund used to clean up underground storage tanks and extending some customs fees. Continuing to allow corporations to reduce funding to pension plans, the increasing corporate taxable profits raises $6.4 billion of the total. I find this provision particularly reckless having worked for a company that failed to adequately fund its pension plan.\Unfortunately, in our current political environment kicking the can down the road is the best we can do.\George Stoddard is a resident of Ivins City.

194,"They don't call themselves the Cowboy Caucus anymore and they don't pick as many fights designed for maximum publicity. But the coalition of rural lawmakers who burned a deep conservative brand in Utah's Legislature in recent years is still intact, still powerful.\Each Friday at 7 a.m. in the Capitol's Room 303, the plainly named Rural Caucus of 25 or so members gathers to hash out issues, swap jokes and strategize.\The result is a small, but united front that can cut a swath through their more numerous urban colleagues as neatly as a combine through a field of barley.\``Rural people are used to hanging together. We've had to. Things are a little tougher out there,'' says Senate Majority Whip Leonard Blackham, a Moroni turkey farmer.\But things don't appear all that tough for rural lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Despite being outnumbered 3-1 by legislators from the four metropolitan Wasatch Front counties, they almost always do better than hold their own.\From landing leadership posts to dominating public lands and environmental agendas to shaping transportation spending, the Rural Caucus is a force.\Part of its success results from the support of Republican majority party leaders like Blackham and House Speaker Mel Brown, a devoted Rural Caucus member. While Brown is a Midvale resident, much of his time is spent in rural Summit County, where he owns and manages a dairy farm with his brother.\Lawmakers in mostly urban Salt Lake County hold their own caucus meetings every Tuesday morning. Representing more than 41 percent of the state's population, they have the numbers to be the political steamroller.\But in contrast to the smaller Rural Caucus, Salt Lake County's group rarely votes on issues. There are too many differences along party and ideological lines.\``Until the urban legislators come together to represent strong urban interests collectively, then the rurals are going to be in control,'' laments Rep. Gene Davis, D-Salt Lake City.\Davis is preparing to tangle with his county counterparts this session over the issue of cougars.\He has a bill proposing to undo a rural-led initiative approved last year to reduce the crime of cougar poaching from a felony to a misdemeanor. If Davis' measure ever is released from the Rules Committee, it has a one-way ticket to oblivion in the House Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment Committee.\``They're lying in wait for it and they'll make me eat a little cougar,'' says Davis, grimacing.\If ever there was a symbol of rural clout in the Legislature it is this committee. All you need to do is count the cowboy boots.\The makeup is 11 rural legislators to three from the Wasatch Front, just the reverse of the demographic makeup of the state.\Rep. Mary Carlson, D-Salt Lake City, acknowledges some frustration at being one of the trio of metropolitan legislators on the panel. ``I'll always be the minority here. That's OK. What's important is that there is another voice being heard.\``Each person on this committee is doing exactly what they were elected to do -- represent constituents in their district,'' Carlson says. ``Unfortunately, what you've got is a state that is 80 percent urban, but you manage to get committees that don't represent that. They don't reflect the demographics and therefore they don't reflect the interests of the majority.''\Rep. Brad Johnson is head of the committee. He also is leader of the Rural Caucus.\Johnson is no Met Johnson -- the flamboyant, tobacco-chewing, jean-clad legislator who conjured the ``Cowboy Caucus'' label a few years ago and was a magnet for publicity.\Brad Johnson is a quiet, soft-spoken Aurora rancher who works with a plodding tenacity.\This year he is carrying a controversial bill to introduce elk ranching in the state -- a move opposed by wildlife officials as being potentially dangerous to existing herds.\He also is sponsoring a resolution supporting designation of filmmaker-environmentalist Robert Redford's Sundance resort as a wilderness area.\Johnson acknowledges that some urbanites believe the Rural Caucus wields too much clout. He strongly disagrees.\``We don't have any more power than we deserve because we represent large parts of the state, geographically,'' he says.\Rural lawmakers believe they have more vested interest in public lands and wildlife than urban colleagues because the lands are in their back yards.\``Locals start viewing those lands as their own,'' said Rep. Mike Styler, R-Delta. ``They're the ones who use it and they're the ones who take care of it and they're the ones who love it. Sometimes they do resent those who tell them how to manage it.''\In virtually every debate about public lands in Utah's Legislature, the term ``stewardship'' peppers the oration.\``It goes right back to our basic religious philosophy of what the Earth is for: For the use of man,'' explains Blackham.\One of the masterminds behind the Rural Caucus' success, Blackham was one of the first to recognize that while ganging up on natural resource issues allowed domination on that front, it diluted the rural sway in other important policy areas.\Transportation has emerged as the major one of this legislative session.\In a House caucus last week, rural legislators grumbled about being asked to ``subsidize'' the massive I-15 reconstruction project with no guarantees of much-needed roadwork in their areas.\It is an attitude summed up in a worn-out legislative saying: ``If you set a quarter on its edge anywhere in the state of Utah, it will roll to the Wasatch Front.''\Sen. Ed Mayne, D-West Valley City, has an updated version of the adage: ``You roll a quarter in taxes to Salt Lake and you get three back.''\Statistics bear that out.\A Utah Department of Transportation study showed that during the years 1987-1993, Wasatch Front residents heavily subsidized rural highways. For every dollar in state gas tax paid by a Salt Lake County motorist, 48 cents came back in transportation work.\A Davis County gas-tax dollar returned just 42 cents of work; Utah County, 79 cents and Weber County, 60 cents. Meanwhile, Wayne County received a $5.29 return on every $1 in gas tax; Piute got $3.49; Garfield $3 and Beaver $2.60.\Other taxes also help shore up economies in nonmetropolitan areas. While the Wasatch Front population makes up 76.7 percent of the state total, it pays 80.5 percent of state income tax and 79.2 percent of the sales tax. (Some of that sales tax, however, is paid by residents from other counties shopping in metropolitan areas.)\``They've gotten more than they've ever paid into the system,'' Mayne says of rural taxpayers. ``Now, there are some major {transportation} problems on the Wasatch Front and they need to recognize that.''\But there are other ways to look at the division of resources, notes Rep. Keele Johnson, R-Blanding.\``South of Richfield we have 50 percent of the lane miles in the state, but we get only 18 percent of the {highway} money,'' Johnson says.\``My feeling is just don't forget us. I-15 is a mess but we've got some serious problems, too.''\Blackham says rural lawmakers' demands will be firm but practical. He points to a $500,000 project in Beaver County to improve a road network used by a major industry there. Another priority rural project is widening of Highway 6 between Spanish Fork and Price.\``We don't want to get greedy. We just want to make sure it's statewide,'' said Blackham. ``You know the saying: The pigs get fatter and the hogs get eaten.''"
195," Mike Stewart wants to do what no other Salt Lake County Commissioner has done before -- get elected governor.\ The 52-year-old Republican believes his main qualification for the office is 10 years experience in government, along with a record of dealing with real-life issues.\ ""I'm a little reluctant to turn Utah's future over to amateurs. Most of these candidates will have an illusion-ectomy as soon as they get here. Most of their ideas will be illegal and the rest will be impractical,"" he says.\ For example, he points to pledges of no tax increases made by some of his rivals as ""irresponsible.""\ Mr. Stewart makes no such pledge, but says he would raise taxes only as a last resort.\ ""Don't read my lips . . . read my record. I never promised I wouldn't raise property taxes {in Salt Lake County}, I just didn't for the last six years.""\ But Mr. Stewart said there is one tax increase for which he would lead the charge -- a 5-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase for bridge and road repairs.\ Like other candidates, Mr. Stewart sees education as one of the top issues in Utah. But he said the solution to improvement is ""not more money, but better management.""\ He would emphasize decentralized control of schools, getting the Legislature and state School Board away from micro-managing day-to-day operations. Power could be restored to local residents by establishing a council of parents, teachers, school administrators and business people to set priorities and decide how the school should run.\ He would also give state support for local schools through block grants, consolidate school districts and require high school sophomores to commit to post-graduate goals.\ Mr. Stewart said he is committed to improving the environment, and points to the Salt Lake County-pioneered emissions inspection program and the Millcreek Canyon cleanup-entrance fee.\ If elected, he would continue the state practice of providing tax incentives for use of clean-burning fuels and tax advantages for recycling firms.\ Mr. Stewart said he would mandate government use of recycled products and would require use of recyclable containers and packaging in manufacturing.\ Some of the runaway costs in health care can be brought back under control by increased attention to prevention programs and more reliance on surgical centers and outpatient clinics than on hospitals. He also wants to cap medical malpractice awards in civil suits.\ Mr. Stewart says he would work to privatize state services that don't belong in state hands. One example: liquor stores.\ ""I'm not looking for liberalization of liquor laws,"" he said. But ""state liquor stores could be taken right over in the private sector.""\ He opposes unrestricted abortion rights, supporting Utah's new law, which restricts legal abortion except in cases of rape, incest, fetal defect or danger to the mother's life or health.\ Mr. Stewart is big on volunteerism. He said the use of more than 12,000 volunteers last year saved Salt Lake County $9 million. He believes similar programs could enlist half of Utah's residents in state projects that would save tens of millions of dollars.\ Mr. Stewart also sees the state's 3,000 prison inmates as a source of cheap labor. He wants to use nonviolent offenders in work crews to clean up the Jordan River Parkway and for other public projects."

\
SALT LAKE CITY - A bill that would give nursing mothers an exemption from jury service advanced to the state House of Representatives.
\
A bill designed to reduce conflict between former spouses and increase the time children of divorce spend with each parent is moving forward.
\
And a bill that would prevent anyone under age 18 from getting a tattoo has yet to be heard.
\
One-third of the way through Utah's 2015 legislative session, actions important to Utah families - from specific items like the tattooing measure, to the larger budget concerns such as education - are being debated. Here is a report on six areas of concern for Utahns.
\
Your education
\
Parents, students and teachers are already raising their voices in support of legislation they hope will foster a more personalized education experience for their families.
\
That includes Natalie Pollard, who is hoping lawmakers will provide better resources for teachers in helping her son, Aran, and other students with dyslexia overcome learning barriers.
\
It also includes Lorena Riffo-Jenson, who wants her daughters and others in the rising generation to be well-informed on their privilege and responsibility to actively engage in their community and government.
\
In his State of the State address, Gov. Gary Herbert spoke of his proposal to introduce $500 million in new funds for education and to allow local school districts the flexibility they need in meeting the needs of each student.
\
""As we continue to step up our investment in education, we must not sidestep our commitment to the principle of local control,"" Herbert said.
\
With the likely availability of surplus money, lawmakers are well into the process of deciding how best to fund a variety of needs for students in the most-efficient way possible.
\
Last week, the Public Education Appropriations Subcommittee approved a $3.9 billion base budget recommendation, with $48.6 million to account for an expected enrollment increase of 7,000 students this fall.
\
Lawmakers are also keen on keeping class sizes as low as possible. One bill awaiting Senate approval would add $10 million to a $115 million fund devoted to lessening the ratio of students to teachers in Utah.
\
But being able to attract and retain quality teachers in the state remains a struggle. Utah's starting teacher salaries fall between $10,000 and $20,000 a year below those in Wyoming, and lawmakers say they are realizing the need to provide better incentives for educators.
\
A bill that proposed raising the personal income tax in Utah by 0.5 percent to provide salary increases for teachers was struck down last week in committee. Bill sponsor Rep. Jack Draxler, R-North Logan, said finding ways to improve teacher salaries remains critical to lifting the quality of education in Utah.
\
""I'm going to weigh in very aggressively with my colleagues with addressing the issues that my bill would have addressed, and that is teacher pay and technology,"" Draxler said.
\
Technology for education is in fact finding growing momentum in the Legislature. One bill awaiting Senate approval would appropriate funds to purchase software that would allow teachers to provide faster feedback on their students' English language arts and writing coursework.
\
Another bill in the Senate seeks to allocate $2 million toward giving students foundational coursework in computer coding skills in junior high and high school.
\
However, Utah's largest technology bill, which would facilitate 1-to-1 student technology programs and other initiatives, has yet to emerge. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Howard Stephenson, R-Draper, who serves on the appropriations committees for public and higher education, said it was likely the bill would be numbered and scheduled for committee this week.
\
Science, technology, engineering and math aren't the only priorities for lawmakers to decide on. Among the Utah State Board of Regents' funding requests for higher education is a $36 million performing arts building at Utah Valley University, the only university in the state without a place to showcase its theater, ballroom dance and music programs.
\
Although the building remains relatively low on the priority list when compared with other buildings and a growing interest in performance-based funds for instructors and institutions, UVU leaders are asking the Legislature to take into account a broad range of educational needs and announced last week more than $15 million in private donations to help make it a reality.
\
It's a task lawmakers hope to carry out for both public and higher education.
\
""In the final budget, when we get through with everything, we as chairs are committed to ensure that every single (school) has a sizable increase, and that hopefully we can walk away with whatever we've done and say, 'It's fair,' "" Stephenson said.
\
Your rights
\
Anti-discrimination and religious freedom remain at the forefront for Utah lawmakers, but they have yet to debate any legislation on the issues.
\
Republican majority leaders in the House and Senate want to combine protections against discrimination in housing and the workplace for LGBT Utahns with protections for religious rights in one bill.
\
Gov. Herbert also said there can't be one without the other.
\
Legislators say they're working that way, but House Speaker Greg Hughes, R-Draper, said he's not aware of any imminent legislation. Senate Majority Whip Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said lawmakers might have ""something that could be workable"" in a few days.
\
Democrats say anti-discrimination and religious rights should be considered separately.
\
Much of the impetus for one piece of legislation stems from statements leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints made on the second day of the legislative session.
\
They called on government officials to preserve religious rights while also protecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Utahns from discrimination in housing, employment, and public accommodations such as restaurants, hotels and transportation.
\
LDS Church leaders also emphasized that people should not be forced to perform services that go against their religious beliefs.
\
Discussions among lawmakers, the LGBT community, religious leaders and civic groups are ongoing. And on a national level, it reinvigorated debate among columnists and groups on all sides about the balance between religious liberty and anti-discrimination.
\
Utah Eagle Forum President Gayle Ruzicka likened the process to bringing many sides together on a hate crimes law several years ago. She said this issue won't be as easy.
\
Ruzicka said lawmakers need to find a ""proper balance"" with ""carefully written"" language to balance a nondiscrimination law with religious freedom.
\
Troy Williams, executive director of Equality Utah, said he was ""heartened"" by a letter from Herbert that promised respectful discussions among all the parties involved.
\
""I completely take him at his word,"" Williams said.
\
Your money
\
State lawmakers remain at odds over what to do with Utah's gas tax.
\
Republican leaders in the Utah House and Senate agree it's time to make changes, but they differ over whether to make the per-gallon charge a sales tax that adjusts annually or just raise the existing tax.
\
Sen. Kevin Van Tassell, R-Vernal, has a bill to increase the gasoline tax by 10 cents per gallon. It would also raise the tax on diesel fuel by 5 cents per gallon.
\
Rep. Johnny Anderson, R-Taylorsville, is proposing to base the charge on a percentage of the gas price, much like sales tax.
\
""I don't think that the House has much appetite for a gas tax increase,"" said House Speaker Hughes. ""That would illustrate there's a lot of work to do to get some kind of agreement.""
\
The House prefers changing the formula but not raising the tax, he said.
\
Senate Majority Leader Ralph Okerlund, R-Monroe, said senators are waiting for the bills to ""mature"" before having a caucus discussion.
\
Utah's 24.5-cent-per-gallon gas tax hasn't gone up since 1997.
\
The money is needed to help close a projected $11.3 billion gap in transportation funding through 2040, much of it for dealing with thousands of miles of deteriorating state roads.
\
A group of Utah business leaders on Jan. 27 said it's time to invest in both education and transportation, even if that means increasing taxes. But the group, which included officials from the Salt Lake Chamber, Prosperity 2020 and the Utah Transportation Coalition, did not offer specific recommendations for raising income taxes or gas taxes.
\
Your health
\
The wintertime temperature inversion has not yet dominated the 2015 legislative session, but addressing air quality concerns remains a key issue among lawmakers and advocates.
\
Several key measures have advanced out of committee, even as families, medical professionals and others took to the Capitol steps a week ago to make sure the relatively mild inversion season does not lessen the resolve for action.
\
Rep. Steve Handy, R-Layton, has had two of his air quality bills pass out of committees, and one - the school bus replacement bill - is poised for passage in the House.
\
That bill directs $20 million in one-time money to replace the dirtiest diesel school buses with alternative fuel vehicles. The funding is also part of the governor's budget recommendations, leading Handy to believe it has the political traction to pass this year.
\
Another bill, HB15, extends the tax credits on alternative fuel vehicles for another year and sets up a fund within the Utah Department of Environmental Quality for people to get upfront financial assistance to convert their vehicles to natural gas.
\
The idea is to provide for more immediate financial assistance - rather than a tax rebate - for conversions, although the tax credit remains in place.
\
Multiple clean air organizations came together Jan. 31 in a rally at the Capitol that drew thousands of people, a political push to make sure the challenge of cleaning up Utah's air remains front and center for lawmakers.
\
Seven of Utah's counties, or portions of them, remain out of compliance with the federal clean air standards on 24-hour levels of fine particulates, or PM2.5. When inversions set in, levels spike, and the nasty looking air has earned the state the unwelcome notoriety of having the dirtiest air in the country.
\
Although the Utah Air Quality Board has passed more than two dozen new rules aimed at cleaning up the air, advocates say more can be done.
\
In particular, they are watching SB87, sponsored by Sen. Gene Davis, D-Salt Lake City, which seeks to repeal a law that prevents the state air quality agency from making pollution rules more stringent than what the federal government requires.
\
""We are pushing really hard on that bill,"" said Tim Wagner, executive director of Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment.
\
Like last year, the bill has made it out of committee, but groups worry it may not ultimately survive the session.
\
""If we don't come out of this with some measure to eliminate this crazy statute that allows us to go after this problem with our own agency and our own solutions, there are going to be a lot of people who are upset,"" Wagner said.
\
Advocates, too, are worried about the movement afoot by some lawmakers to upend the Air Quality Board's ability to pass a prohibition on wood burning, he said.
\
Your responsibility
\
Gov. Herbert last week toured homeless services provider Volunteers of America - Utah's adult detoxification center - and encouraged Utahns to contribute to the Pamela Atkinson Homeless Trust Fund via a state income tax checkoff.
\
Once clients' conditions are stable, Volunteers of America's addiction programs provide support and structure as clients start to work on substance abuse and other issues that are an impediment to their well-being, according to center director Sue Ativalu.
\
The visit called attention to the plight of those trying to overcome addiction, and to the homeless, and also allowed the governor to make a pitch for his Healthy Utah plan, an alternative to full Medicaid expansion that other states have adopted under the Affordable Care Act. That will be debated by legislators this week.
\
It's part of a push both on and off Capitol Hill to overcome the plight of poverty in all its forms, including a continuation of legislative work to solve intergenerational poverty.
\
More than 52,000 Utah children live in intergenerational poverty in Utah, according to the state's 2014 report on Intergenerational Poverty, Welfare Dependency and the Use of Public Assistance.
\
Intergenerational poverty is generally defined as two or more generations living in poverty, with intergenerational welfare recipients defined as people who received more than 12 months of public assistance as children and more than 12 months of assistance as adults.
\
HB139, sponsored by Rep. Brad Daw, R-Orem, would increase the maximum number of children who could be placed in a single licensed foster home to five, up from four, under certain circumstances. It's designed to keep siblings together.
\
Sen. Aaron Osmond, R-South Jordan, said he plans to introduce legislation to help support the educational goals of people living in poverty to help stop the cycle of children of poverty following the same path of struggle that afflicts their parents.

\
It's uncertain whether Utah voters will see a new primary system next year.
\
Some lawmakers are pushing back against a law passed last year that altered the state's political candidate nomination process.
\
The law, which morphed into SB54 from 2014's County My Vote initiative to restore voter turnout, gives candidates the option to bypass the state's current caucus system and instead collect voter signatures for a place on the primary-election ballot. It also opens primary elections to all voters, as currently the state GOP only allows registered Republicans to vote in its primaries.
\
But the Utah Republican Party filed a lawsuit against SB54, claiming it is unconstitutional and that parties should be free to determine their candidate nomination processes.
\
Now, some lawmakers are advancing legislation that would delay, if not undo, SB54. A Senate committee last week favorably passed two bills sponsored by Sen. Scott Jenkins, R-Plain City, Friday.
\
Jenkins' legislation would amend the Utah Constitution and, as a result, repeal SB54. Jenkins' second bill that was approved Friday, SB43, would delay SB54's changes until after the 2016 election.
\
Jenkins said delaying the law's effect will give political parties much-needed time to adjust the law's changes to the nomination system.
\
""We believe this will help the parties with the time they need to get their house in order,"" Jenkins said.
\
In response to the committee's decision Friday, the Alliance for Better Utah issued a statement in which executive director Maryann Martindale said the Legislature ""acted entirely contrary to the will of the mainstream Utahns by passing out of committee the anti-Count My Vote bills.""
\
""Their actions ... further demonstrate just how out of touch our state Legislature is,"" Martindale stated. ""At a time when Utah voter turnout is at historic lows, the state Legislature should be opening the electoral process, not restricting it.""
\
Efforts to improve voter participation continue this year, as lawmakers are proposing a task force that would investigate factors behind Utah's historically low voter turnout in 2014.
\
Last year marked Utah's lowest voter participation in 54 years, with only 29 percent of Utah voters casting ballots, lawmakers said.

"
197," NEWPORT NEWS, Va. -- The wages of sin are death. The taxes aren't as high, but we can change that.\ Here in Virginia, the General Assembly is considering raising the so-called sin taxes on beer and tobacco, but a broader view -- and more money -- is needed. This is true on the federal level as well as the state.\ Taxes, in addition to raising money, also give government a way to influence behavior. Assume doughnut consumption is too high. A special tax on doughnuts would raise their price, thereby reducing consumption. Maybe. If people are addicted to doughnuts, they will buy them anyway, but there's still more tax revenue. Or, a black market in doughnuts could develop, cutting demand for the more expensive, taxed doughnuts. Still, a tax wisely applied could increase government revenue while also improving the health of the general population by reducing doughnut consumption.\ Another advantage of sin taxes has been demonstrated recently: They provide an alternative revenue source for politicians too scared to suggest raising general taxes. Sure, folks who profit from the manufacture and sale of sin don't want higher taxes on their products, but the average voter isn't likely to make a big public stink over the fact that he smokes or drinks so heavily that he can't afford to pay more in taxes on a six-pack of sin.\ Still, sin taxes as currently defined can't provide enough money to do all the things that government needs to do. But the solution is simple: create an additional sin tax.\ This means finding a product associated with harmful behavior and then taxing it. Consider, then, not a tax on doughnuts, but a tax on gasoline. True, it's already taxed. But that isn't thought of as a sin tax, and there is great resistance to raising it. Redefine it as a sin tax, and the politicians will have something they can support.\ As a candidate for a sin tax, gasoline is perfect. Its primary use is as a fuel for cars, and think of the damage the automobile has done to American society:\ -- It has destroyed our downtowns by enabling people to move out to the suburbs and beyond.\ -- It is heavily responsible for our reliance on oil from the Middle East and the costs associated with protecting access to that oil. As Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., has said, ""We wouldn't have put 500,000 troops in the gulf if Saudi Arabia's main export were kiwis.""\ -- Our trade deficit is caused in part by the need to import oil.\ -- Much of the damage done to our environment is due to automobile emissions. Also, there are environmental costs associated with getting oil out of the ground, refined and to the service station.\ Society could blame gasoline at least partly for teen-age pregnancy -- we all know what goes on in automobiles -- skinned knuckles that come from trying to fix cars, lost productivity caused by traffic jams and long commutes, and the huge costs of maintaining interstates and other highways. The list could go on and on.\ Robb has endorsed a 40-cent increase in the federal gas tax, but not to increase revenue. No, he would give the money back in a rebate, the hope being that the public will accept the plan because there's no overall increase in its tax burden, and in the process the higher price at the pump would prod certain changes in society, such as the production of more fuel-efficient cars. He wants to use the tax to alter behavior.\ But the rebate is a weird gimmick. Let's just label the gas tax a sin tax and then raise it along with the others. People might support that, and we'd all be better off."
198,"
Your newspaper recently criticized a bill to raise state fuel taxes, sponsored by Rep. Wayne Harper. Odd as it may seem, our industry must disagree. The state of our highways is rapidly disintegrating. Mountain View Corridor must be funded, without tolls, and we face other critical needs in Utah County and elsewhere. While I can think of no other single industry that would pay more in fuel tax, we believe it is past time to act.
\
Within the next 20 years, the number of trucks on the highways will double. Trucks are often overlooked in discussing future highway needs; often we feel like an afterthought. Between 70 percent and 80 percent of processed and manufactured goods are transported by truck. Diversion to rail and other modes is not an option; they are at or near capacity. With increasing highway congestion, truck production drops resulting in higher freight rates to shippers and increasing prices to consumers. Congestion contributes to more accidents and to the release of more harmful emissions into the environment.
\
On Jan. 15, the National Surface Transportation Revenue and Policy Study Commission recommended the ""gas tax"" continue to be the primary source of future highway funding.
\
If we fail to act now on our critical highway needs, we will only have to pay more in the coming decades. Mountain View Corridor must be built, and built as a freeway -- not a toll road. If it is a nontoll highway, everyone in the state will benefit. Commuters on I- 15 will get relief from chokepoints and increasing numbers of commercial trucks. Our economy will benefit from the capacity to move freight and people more smoothly and rapidly. Utah County is in dire need of I-15 widening and improvement to meet current and future demand.
\
Your editorial also mentioned polling in which 70 percent of Utahns opposed raising the fuel tax. Obviously, no one wants higher taxes. However, we believe that if given the choice of more hours lost in commuting, bottlenecks, higher accident rates, productivity losses that cost jobs and investment, or a reasonable increase in the fuel tax, Utah voters can be persuaded. In fact, we have gathered in a coalition with several cities and chambers of commerce and funded some polling of our own. We asked the question, ""If you could be sure that the funds generated would go toward the construction of new freeways and improving traffic flow on key roads and intersections, would you favor or oppose a 5-cent per gallon fuel tax increase?"" In response, 52 percent still opposed, but 44 percent were in favor. We believe that means the public is open on this issue if we can trust that the money will be used properly.
\
Perhaps an even better question would be ""Would you prefer paying for new highways through an increased gas tax or through tolls on major routes?"" With the cost of projects continuing to increase and demands on budget surpluses also increasing, funding must come from either higher gas taxes or tolls. I believe people would prefer the former.
\
Texas has of late become the ""Capital of Toll Roads."" A new political party has even formed to oppose them, and the Texas Legislature has imposed a two-year moratorium on new toll projects. Yet, at the same time, Gov. Rick Perry's own Business Council performed an in-depth study that concluded that an 8-cent per gallon fuel tax increase and then indexing the tax to the Highway Cost Index would meet the state's $66 billion in unmet, critical highway needs without further tolling. Let's not make the same mistakes other states are making.
\
Speaking on behalf of our 88-year-old Utah-based company and our association, we remain vitally committed to doing what is necessary to assure the continued, efficient flow of the nation's goods. We strongly support the sacrifices we will all need to make to fund our highway needs and ask for immediate action. The Legislature has done much the past few years to fund roads with ""one-time"" money, but we must have ongoing funding. There is no perfect solution, but Rep. Harper ought not be criticized for making a courageous attempt in a political year. We call on House and Senate leadership to support such efforts, and ask that the Deseret Morning News not be so quick to condemn those who attempt to provide leadership on this difficult issue.

199,"\Today is Tax Day — the deadline for filing your taxes — so we should use the opportunity to reflect on the situation and consider future reforms (and increases) that will hit your pocketbook.\Let’s start with education. At a time when many Utahns want to see more funding for public schools, recent federal tax reforms are causing families with children to pay more state income taxes.\This begs the question, who should be paying for public schooling? Should everyone be compelled to contribute because education benefits all of society? Should the rich pay a greater percentage then they already do? Or should those that are using the government’s service pay for it?\This is only one of the critical tax topics that Utahns need to consider.\Right now, the state dips into the general fund to subsidize transportation. On November’s ballot, you’ll be asked if you want to increase the gas tax by 10 cents per gallon. This extra revenue would help offset some of the transportation earmarks, but relying on the gas tax is a problem for the long term as the market moves toward alternative fuels. Less gas purchased means less revenue for government coffers.\A different solution is needed to stabilize transportation funding as it becomes clear that mass transit is an outdated approach to solving congestion. Ride-sharing, driverless vehicles and other future innovations from the marketplace also need to be seriously considered.\Another critical issue appears to be paradoxical. Businesses simply pass on increased costs from taxes and regulations to their consumers via increased prices. This is part of the reason the federal corporate income tax was lowered and why the Utah Legislature has pursued a variety of policies to ease the burden of state corporate income taxes on Utah businesses.\These types of policies may seem to signal less revenue for government, but they result in increased wages and salaries while producing lower prices for consumers. This creates a business-friendly environment that inevitably increases tax revenue over the long run.\Pursuing these types of broad-based policies is also much more fair, rather than providing tax exemptions, grants and other incentives to select, politically connected businesses.\Decreasing the state individual and corporate income tax rate is a start, but that rate needs to be closer to 4 percent than 5 percent to move Utah away from the middle of the pack in relation to other states. Staying competitive requires a tax rate reduction.\And while large businesses and many individuals will soon see some tax cuts, small businesses have been left out of the discussion. The Legislature failed to pass a proposal earlier this year to provide relief from the annual business supply tax that requires owners to count up and calculate taxes each year on all sorts of tangible property they own. This must be a priority next year.\Other important discussions need to be had about sales taxes. As the economy continues to be more service-oriented rather than goods-oriented, the claimed need to increase sales tax rates will continue to be at issue. Whether Utah should broaden the sales tax base by taxing services — and online sales as well — will continue to be debated. A broad and fair reform should allow Utah to lower its overall sales tax rate.\All these issues that must be dealt with in the near future show that major tax reform is just in its beginning stages. Tax Day discussions like the ones of late will continue to be the norm.\While today is Tax Day, April 11 was Utah’s Tax Freedom Day — the day when Utahns collectively earned enough money to pay their total tax bill (federal, state and local) for 2018. Some states like New York have such high taxes that they won’t have their Tax Freedom Day until May 14. You can learn more by visiting TaxFreedomDay.org.\As you submit this year’s tax returns and as you consider candidates for political office this year, remember that they will be dealing with weighty tax policies over the next few years. Make sure they represent the principles that are important to you, because big changes are likely to soon come.\CREDIT: Michael Melendez, Deseret News"

SALT LAKE CITY - Some Utah roads are costing drivers hundreds of dollars a year in vehicle maintenance, a new report states.
\
According to ""Bumpy Roads Ahead: America's Roughest Rides and Strategies to Make our Roads Smoother,"" more than a quarter of the nation's major urban roadways, highways and streets that are the main routes for commuters and commerce are in poor condition.
\
The report was released by TRIP, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., that researches, evaluates and distributes economic and technical data on transportation issues.
\
The study examined ""the condition of the nation's major urban roads, including pavement condition data for the most populated urban areas, recent trends in travel, the latest developments in repairing roads and building them to last longer, as well as the funding levels needed to adequately address deteriorating roadways.""
\
In Utah, driving on deteriorated urban roads costs some motorists more than $600 annually, according to the data collected on large metros with populations of at least 500,000 residents and midsize urban areas with populations between 250,000 and 500,000. The report calculated the additional costs passed on to drivers due to travel on poorly maintained roads.
\
The report showed that poor roads are costing drivers in the Salt Lake metro area $640 in added fuel consumption, tire wear and extra maintenance. The area also has the state's highest percentage of poor- and mediocre-rated roads.
\
The Provo-Orem area has roads that rank among the worst among the nation's medium-size urban areas, costing drivers an extra $583 a year.
\
The report comes as the U.S. Senate passed a $350 billion, long-term transportation bill Thursday on a 65-34 vote with bipartisan support. House lawmakers, however, already have dispersed for their August recess.
\
The bill calls for changes to highway, transit, railroad and auto safety programs, but its sponsors were only able to find enough money to pay for the first three years of the six-year bill.
\
The bill also attempts to speed up environmental reviews of construction projects and encourages states to impose user fees on electric vehicles because they use roadways but don't contribute to federal gas tax revenues. It also sets aside money for major projects and directs highway aid to major freight transportation corridors.
\
During the 2015 Legislature, state lawmakers passed HB362, which reformed the state's gas tax to support maintenance and preservation of state highways and freeways, but not local roads. Many civic leaders have expressed concerns about insufficient funding for local road maintenance.
\
The report also found that every dollar invested in preventative road maintenance saves $10 to $25 in future rehabilitation work, said Abby Albrecht, director of the Utah Transportation Coalition.
\
The organization is a group of business and civic leaders advocating specifically for transportation infrastructure investment to protect Utah's environment, improve the economy and preserve the quality of life.
\
""Our cities and county officials have been grappling with deteriorating roads and funding,"" Albrecht said. ""Now we have hard data on just how much of an impact this has on an average Utahn. The costs of doing nothing in this case are far higher for the average Utah family than the proposed voter-approved local option, which would only cost a penny for every $4.""
\
HB362 authorizes a county to impose a local-option sales and use tax of 0.25 percent for roads and public transit. The bill's chief sponsor, Rep. Johnny Anderson, R-Taylorsville, noted that voters must first endorse the proposed tax at the ballot box.
\
""If the voters approve it, that should provide much of the funding necessary for local communities to improve the quality of their roads,"" Anderson said. ""Nobody likes a tax increase, but this one goes directly to pay for those (roadway) assets, and if we don't maintain them, they will be more costly in the future.""
\
The Salt Lake County Council will address the issue during its meeting Tuesday. If placed on the ballot and backed by voters, the measure could generate nearly $54 million for transportation and infrastructure needs, Councilwoman Aimee Winder Newton said.
\
Though she has not decided whether to favor the increase just yet, Newton acknowledged that roads cost more taxpayer dollars when they are not properly maintained.
\
""Good transportation infrastructure directly impacts economic development and helps us maintain a healthy economy for years to come, which ultimately saves taxpayer dollars,"" she said. ""Whether or not these things can be funded through more conservative government spending, or if we need to increase the sales tax to pay for these things, is what (we) hope to figure out in the coming weeks and months.""
\
Other Wasatch Front counties are contemplating similar initiatives, but ultimately it will be up to voters to determine if they want to pay to improve local driving conditions and reduce the long-term environmental impacts, Albrecht said.
\
""We want to make sure that roads are maintained, our air quality is clean, traffic congestion is low,"" she said, ""and the only way we're doing to do that is to continue to invest.""

"
201,"During the just completed session of the Utah Legislature, Rep. Bill Hickman, R-St. George, sought ways to slap it to the urbanites along the Wasatch Front and needle the Utah Travel Council, an agency he feels has not given his southwestern Utah area a fair promotion shake.\Hickman made a motion in the Economic Development and Human Resources Appropriations Subcommittee to slash more than a quarter of a million dollars from the Travel Council's tourism promotion budget.\His scheme had an eyebrow-raising twist: He added intent language that directed the Travel Council to make the cuts only in promotions for Utah's winter recreation programs. Funding for summer recreation ad campaigns would remain unscathed.\The message was clear. Winter promotions center around Utah skiing, which takes place mostly at resorts clustered along the populous Wasatch Front. Summer recreation brings money-bearing tourists to the vast, beautiful, sparsely populated rural areas of the state, mostly in the south.\Hickman, a Cowboy Caucus champion of rural legislative interests, packed considerable ammunition behind his Machiavellian motion because he is chairman of the House Rules Committee.\Several Republican members of the committee approached House Minority Leader Dave Jones, one of the token Democrats on the committee, and asked him to make a motion to remove Hickman's intent language.\Those Wasatch Front Republicans, who didn't want the winter sports businesses in their area to suffer, told Jones it must be a Democrat standing up to Hickman. A fellow Republican combating the powerful Rules Committee chairman could be unhealthy for that Republican's bills, the reasoning went.\Jones complained that if he made the motion, he would end up standing all alone, that in the end his Republican friends would not back him. He was assured that if he made the motion, there would be enough votes to repeal the intent language.\Jones made the motion, then nudged fellow Democrat Trisha Beck and said, ``Watch this go down in flames.''\When the committee voted, Jones and Beck alone stood against the intent language. The others stayed with their Rules Committee chairman and chose to sacrifice the ski resorts.\The intent language actually was repealed in the executive appropriations committee, but the drama inside the economic development subcommittee typifies the influence the outnumbered rural legislators have on the Legislature.\Perhaps the most telling example of rural control over the state lawmaking body is the stranglehold rural legislators had on Gov. Mike Leavitt's gas-tax plan throughout most of the 45-day session.\To get a gas tax to fund the massive I-15 construction project before the 2002 Olympics, Leavitt and Republican moderates had to cut the sales tax -- something they did not want to do -- as a trade-off.\Lawmakers and legislative observers cite rural unity in the Legislature -- a likemindedness fed by their belief that those living inside the urban belt from Ogden to Provo consider them second-class citizens.\The paranoia that rural Utah is constantly dumped on by the urban centers is evident daily in the rhetoric spouted on the Legislature's House and Senate floors: Urbanites are after their water and their land and try to lock up their natural resources in wilderness designation so they cannot earn a living.\The resentment toward the state's Wasatch Front population center manifested itself with a bill that came out of the Cowboy Caucus-packed House Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment Committee.\The bill, sponsored by Rep. Tom Hatch, R-Panguitch, would have imposed a special water tax on all users to raise money to mitigate the cost to rural communities from the Endangered Species Act.\The bill sailed through committee, then it was quietly killed behind closed doors by House leadership and a coalition of lobbyists.\The rural coalition successfully plugged up a bill to make part-time day-care centers safer for children by requiring them be licensed along with full-time centers. The bill finally passed this year, on a third try. Funding for before-and-after school programs for latchkey kids also passed against unified opposition by the rural caucus.\Child advocacy and education issues are always an uphill battle in the Republican Caucus because of its control by the rural legislators, confirmed Rep. Nora Stephens, R-Sunset.\Fifty-six of the 75 members of the House of Representatives can be considered representing urban areas. Thirty-one reside in Salt Lake County alone.\That leaves 19 representatives from Utah's ``outback.'' But they exert control in the Republican Caucus from which policy decisions emanate.\One source of Cowboy Caucus power is House Speaker Mel Brown. While a resident and representative of Midvale, he owns a dairy farm in rural Summit County and shares many cowboy sentiments. Brown's soft heart for the rurals led to a domino effect of factors pushing more control into the hands of that relatively small segment of legislators.\Brown appointed Hickman, a caucus stalwart, as chairman of the Rules Committee which, more than any other single factor, determines the fate of legislation.\The urban legislators do not have the same common purpose as do rurals. Davis County has different interests than Salt Lake County, for example.\And almost all the Democrats -- 17 of the 20 in the House and eight of nine in the Senate -- are from urban districts. Because Democrats have no clout in the Republican-Polygripped Legislature -- those urban areas are voiceless when the Republican Caucus makes its decisions.\This rural choke on legislative policy exists despite the fact that 77 percent of Utah's population lives in the four urban counties of Weber, Davis, Salt Lake and Utah. Forty-one percent lives in Salt Lake County alone. Studies done by the Utah Office of Planning and Budget indicate that urban growth will continue at a faster pace than rural growth, and by 2020 the urban population will be close to 80 percent."
202,"Occasionally, The Salt Lake Tribune’s political reporters and columnists chat about the hottest topics of the week. The following is a lightly edited transcript of their conversation.\Benjamin Wood (reporter): Welcome to the Trib Caucus Slack chat, which convenes weekly during the legislative session but also meets in special caucus during times of fiscal crisis, war, natural disasters or emergencies in the affairs of state.\In this case, I have issued a call of the caucus for a special Halloween slack chat to discuss next week’s midterm elections.\Let’s start with the big topic — the 4th Congressional District — which polling suggests is a neck-and-neck race between Nancy Pelosi and a bag of campaign donations wearing glasses and a fake mustache.\Does anyone have a prediction, hot take or burning question for the Love/McAdams matchup?\Lee Davidson (reporter): I think the Mia Love-Ben McAdams race is too close to call, really — but momentum in the polls seems to be on McAdams' side.\I do predict this is maybe just the first election between the two, with at least one more to come. If Love loses, I see her easily running to regain her seat in two years. If McAdams wins, ditto — unless Democrats draft him as their best shot to run for governor in 2020. In short, my crystal ball does see two more years of ongoing political attacks between the pair.\Wood:\Robert Gehrke (columnist): Yeah. I’m with Lee. I think Ben McAdams wins the 4th District .... in 2020. This year is gonna be sooo close. I’d guess somewhere between 1,000 and 1,500 votes either way. Which I guess considering this race was decided by about 750 votes in 2012, that’s a blowout.\Davidson: This has been Love’s race to lose, and she has suffered some self-inflicted wounds. She raised $1 million for a primary race that was never held. When the FEC questioned it, she fought back instead of simply reallocating and refunding money (which she eventually did anyway).\When she said the FEC had finally ruled in her favor and cleared her, she urged reporters to call the FEC to verify it. The FEC then had no comment, leading to an embarrassing story for her. After pressure from her, the FEC did send an email but it wasn’t quite the full clearance she claimed — but she insisted it was, and even called for “unethical” McAdams to withdraw from the race for saying otherwise.\She then said an outside group had been forced to withdraw ads about its claims about the $1 million, which proved to be false. Lately, her campaign has tried to make the race about whether a McAdams win will make Nancy Pelosi the new House speaker, instead of focusing on local issues — which smacks of a desperation move. Etc. Etc. The unforced errors have hurt her as McAdams has gained in the polls.\Bethany Rodgers (reporter): Do you think the campaign finance question itself has hurt Love as much as her reaction to it?\Gehrke: Her campaign is convinced all the attention paid to the FEC matter has really hurt her. Kept her from getting back on message as we saw that lead whittled away from 9 points to a tie.\Wood: We should note that “all the attention” was largely driven by her side, as Lee illustrated above.\The battle between the FEC and Rep. Mia Love continues with yet another email about her fundraising practiceshttps://t.co/tSQpmm0azp\— The Salt Lake Tribune (@sltrib) October 31, 2018\Taylor Stevens (reporter): We did see Nathan Evershed, the Republican candidate for district attorney, face some trouble for this back in September. He exceeded campaign spending caps and returned $18,000 in campaign funds. But he basically said, “Sorry, my bad” and returned it, and that hasn’t been a major thrust of that campaign ever since.\Wood: He said “sorry, my bad” after first telling me the story was a “nothing-burger.”\Stevens: A new poll from KUTV is showing McAdams up 6 points over Love. It will be interesting to see if that really marks a change in the tide of this election or if that’s an aberration, as some have argued.\Wood: But that’s just one of those dirty robo-polls that don’t count, per Love’s campaign.\Gehrke: With respect to the good folks at KUTV, I don’t believe that 6.5-point McAdams lead at all.\Wood: HOT TAKE!\Gehrke: The same poll had Romney up 52-37 in the 4th District. Do we really think Mitt will only win the 4th by 15? He won it 67-30 when he ran for president.\Wood: Yeah that portion of the poll was a red flag. But the favorability numbers largely tracked.\Gehrke: The recent Trib poll had Romney 59-23. So the KUTV poll has some real problems somewhere, or those races have changed a lot ... and there’s nothing to make me believe that the dynamics of the race have actually changed.\Wood: Well the Trib’s polls are always off by 5 points, again per Love’s team.\Davidson: Remember, the Tribune poll and a New York Times poll both have the 4th District as tied.\Wood: New York Times? Never heard of 'em.\Gehrke: The KUTV poll also had McAdams winning 23 percent of Republicans (ours had him winning 15 percent). And they had him dominating among unaffiliateds, winning 87 percent of them (compared to 61 percent in our poll).\Wood: That unaffiliated number is, objectively, shocking\Gehrke: I think based on the direction this race has been moving, McAdams probably pulls it out. But it’ll be in that 1,000 to 1,500 vote margin.\Davidson: We had some fun with early voting numbers yesterday. They may not mean much. But we multiplied the number of votes by party so far by the percentage of support that our poll says candidates have in each party. In short, it suggested that McAdams may be winning 47k to 44k.\The Love folk didn’t dispute that, interestingly. But they said Democrats tend to vote early, and Republicans take their time — but in the past have come in strong for Love.\Eighty-five percent of voters in the district are in Salt Lake County, 11 percent in Utah County. It will be interesting to see how big of a margin that Love must win by in Utah County to win the election. It may be a lot.\Wood: OK, who has a non-CD4 Hot Take and/or burning question?\[Insert medical marijuana joke there^]\Gehrke: I think this DA race between Sim Gill and Nathan Evershed could be closer than some people think. Gill has been taking some hard shots over turnover in the office (See Taylor’s story) , from disgruntled cops and regarding how he’s handled sexual assault cases. He probably wins, but this is usually a pretty competitive race and could be closer than people think.\“In the last two years, we lost over 30 percent of the district attorney employees,” @nathanevershed says. “They are leaving because of politics within the office. We are losing experienced attorneys and staff, and that costs taxpayers as well as victims.”https://t.co/wz654UI6od\— The Salt Lake Tribune (@sltrib) October 30, 2018\Wood: The county council has at-large Republican members, so the county is not the blue lock some tend to think it is. I see the DA’s race as likely more competitive than the sheriff’s race, but who really knows?\Rodgers: Has there been any polling in that race?\Gehrke: I could make up some numbers, if you’d like, since polling lower profile races is hard. Let’s say Gill 32, Evershed 27, 40 percent undecided.\#FakePolls\Wood: HOT TAKE!\Davidson: Of course, the Tribune endorsed Sim Gill. That could put Evershed over the top.\Just kidding.\Rodgers: Or are you ...\The @sltrib released a series of endorsements in recent weeks that inspired many readers to reach out with questions and concerns.\On the latest episode of @TribTalk, The Trib's owner explains who the paper endorsed and why.https://t.co/pQoFbUGpO5\— The Salt Lake Tribune (@sltrib) October 31, 2018\Stevens: Interestingly, the sheriff’s race has some similar characteristics to the district attorney’s race. In both, a Republican insider in the office is challenging his Democrat boss. And both are using office politics as a major platform.\Davidson: Same is in the county clerk race.\Wood: 10 points to anyone who can name the GOP clerk candidate without looking it up.\Gehrke: Rozan Mitchell.\Stevens: Rozan Mitchell\Wood: BOOM!\Stevens: Gehrke beat me to it!\Gehrke: That has been an interesting dynamic hasn’t it? I don’t know that it resonates all that much with voters who don’t really care as much who sits in which desk, as long as the job gets done. But what do I know?\Rodgers: I wonder whether centering a campaign on internal office politics is a good strategy, though.\Wood: Good point. That’s a literal inside-politics fight\Stevens: It certainly might make the office dynamics more uncomfortable come January, no matter who wins.\Rodgers: Yeah, awkward!\Gehrke: Rozan has been an elections officer under Sherrie Swensen for years. She’s very sharp and competent. I was a little surprised when she ran against her boss though.\Stevens: Speaking of office politics and the county clerk’s race, that one already has had an impact on the office. Mitchell is taking an extended leave of absence because she says the environment became too toxic.\Wood: What does Sim Gill do next if he loses?\Gehrke: I think if he loses, Sim finishes writing his philosophy book. If he wins by a big margin, he’ll have people pushing him to run for AG.\I’m curious where ya’ll think the propositions are going to end up. I have a feeling that Prop. 4 may be the only one that gets across the finish line.\Wood: HOT TAKE!\Gehrke: The hottest of hot takes.\Wood: Q1 started in a losing position, but they’ve blitzed the ads in the final weeks. I expect narrow margins either way for Prop 2 and 3\Davidson: I think Prop 2 will be close, and I still think it passes. Watch that prediction go up in smoke (joke intended).\Wood: Zing!\Davidson: I do think that Prop 4, to create an independent commission to recommend political district boundaries, will likely coast to victory. As supporters say, it’s hard to support gerrymandering. The one potential problem is where the funding has come for the Better Boundaries effort: 69 percent is from out-of-state, and most big donors are Democrats or left-leaning groups. More than half of the group’s money came from just one donor: the Action Now Initiative, an advocacy group founded by billionaires John and Laura Arnold of Texas.\Such funding allowed Senate President Wayne Niederhauser to claim that the proposition is not really about better boundaries, “just better boundaries for Democrats.” He says its real aim is to create a safe congressional district for Democrats in Utah. Supporters say Republicans have gerrymandered districts for decades to hurt Democrats unfairly here.\Advertisements in favor of creating an independent commission to draw Utah’s political boundaries compare gerrymandering to how children left to cut their own cake come up with unfair slices that serve themselveshttps://t.co/684SMkuT7I\— The Salt Lake Tribune (@sltrib) October 31, 2018\Rodgers: Utah Patients Coalition just sent out their election night party invitation. But I think, with the promise of a special session on medical marijuana, they’re feeling celebratory either way the Prop 2 vote goes. (edited)\Wood: And there’s literally no organized opposition to Prop 4. Everything else has someone or something fighting it (however belatedly).\Gehrke: Bethany, is it your sense that the margin on Prop 2 (pass or fail) does anything in terms of the leverage the advocates has as they keep tinkering with the compromise language (as you reported last week)?\Rodgers: I definitely think that the Prop 2 vote will make a difference during the session. Christine Stenquist with TRUCE Utah says medical marijuana advocates will essentially be at the mercy of lawmakers if the proposition goes down. The folks with the Utah Patients Coalition seem to feel more confident that they’ll maintain some bargaining power, but I’m sure they’ll be in better position if the voters speak loudly in favor of medical cannabis.\Wood: Considering that the whole reason this is on the ballot is because lawmakers couldn’t get an otherwise-popular proposal across the finish line... I think the margin matters.\Gehrke: I think Prop. 3, to expand Medicaid, is in some real trouble. The polling on that one was tepid, even before they got any opposition. And I think Question 1, the gas tax increase for education (to simplify it) will probably fail. I think voters hate to raise their own taxes and aren’t willing to put their money where their mouth is.\Davidson: They also wonder why gas taxes would go up to pay for schools. When confused, vote no — that’s the usual rule of thumb.\Stevens: Our own polling shows 59 percent of Utah voters are in favor of Proposition 3, though, which is up slightly from a similar poll in June.\Wood: Q1 did not connect with voters they way Our Schools Now hopes. Whatever goodwill the public has for education funding, it’s pretty clear the gas tax replacement scheme wasn’t what the state at large was looking for.\The best thing that could happen for Q1 supporters is if it passes by the narrowest of narrow margins, like 50.1 to 49.9\Stevens: HOT TAKE\Wood: HOT TAKE!\Gehrke: Yeah. The education advocates cut this deal with the Legislature and it ends up being a real problem because the concept they came up with was way too complicated. I tried to explain it but I have heard from a lot of people who A. Don’t get why gas money going to roads helps schools. B. Don’t trust the Legislature to keep its promise to get money to schools. C. Think schools are run by fat cat bureaucrats who get quarter-million-dollar salaries.\Wood: This is leading nicely into my burning question. It’s an open secret Speaker Hughes is looking at a run for governor in 2020. Does it hurt him at all that we had an unprecedented number of initiatives under his watch? And what if all or some pass?\Rodgers: He’s definitely trying to draw attention to his work brokering a compromise in the medical cannabis debate — maybe getting ahead of the criticism there.\Gehrke: Good point, Bethany. He’ll run as the guy who brokered the medical marijuana compromise and got Operation Rio Grande off the ground. I’m not sure the other two will hurt him, especially if they fail\Wood: That’s a weird horn to toot, though: “I brokered a last-minute compromise!... after failing to broker compromises in general sessions.”\Davidson: It doesn’t help. But people have short memories, so it doesn’t hurt much either. They will probably remember work on Rio Grande and the homeless more.\Gehrke: One other potential gubernatorial candidate who has got a little bump this election has been Spencer Cox.

1. What is the major issue facing Utah today and how would you deal with it?
\
Education is the most important issue facing Utah today; teaching our children is our most important stewardship. The future of our state is in their hands. The quality of their education is in ours. We can and we must do better for Utah's children and our state's future.
\
Education is the key to our children's life prospects. Education is the engine that drives our economy. Our goal is excellence. We will achieve it with quality teachers, parental involvement, innovation and choice in public schools, accountability, and realistic reforms. We will achieve it with sensible, long-range planning that makes education an even higher priority. We will achieve it together through a pledge to education. This challenge requires a total commitment from all of us, a commitment I will bring to the governor's office.
\
The task is great. Our teachers and students have performed well with far fewer resources than are devoted to education in other states. For years, Utah has invested less per student than any other state and has among the largest class sizes in the country. The future holds even more challenges, including a projected influx of 145,000 more students in the next ten years and the need for 1,175 additional teachers every year for the next 20 years. Meeting these challenges will require all Utah citizens to work together to keep our children's educational future bright.
\
Fifty years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court declared in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that "" . . . education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments."" In Utah, we always have agreed with that statement. We must reaffirm it. Indeed, the Utah Constitution requires the Legislature to "" . . . provide for the establishment and maintenance of . . . a public education system, which shall be open to all children of the state."" We have a good system with very dedicated educators. I look forward to working with them to make it even better.
\
The most important thing we can do to strengthen Utah's economy is to improve our education system. Economic development and quality education are inseparable. In fact, improving education and strengthening our economy are really two sides of the same coin.
\
To attract new businesses to Utah and to help our existing businesses grow, we must have a well-trained, well-educated work force. Without a first-class education system, our children will not be equipped for the demanding jobs of the 21st century. And if our children are not well-trained and well-educated, Utah will fail to attract desirable employers and high-paying jobs to our state.
\
Without a first-rate education system, our economy will never reach its potential. That's why, as governor, education--from preschool to adult education--will always be my highest priority.
\
Because education is so important to our economic future, I have developed a detailed education plan. This plan, entitled ""We Can Do Better: A Pledge to Education,"" is available on my Web site at www.mathesonforgovernor.com.
\
2. What is the one personal trait/characteristic that you want voters to know about you and why is that important in this race?
\
I know this job. I have a clear understanding of what the Governor can do to make a difference in people's lives. I'm a pragmatist and a consensus builder. That means I value input from differing points of view and rely on all available evidence to make common sense decisions. It also means that I welcome ideas from all parts of the state, both sides of the political aisle, and best practices from other states and the private sector. Finally, it means that I have an open mind and a strong commitment to fairness and balance.
\
3. Should you win this office, are you willing to self-limit your time in office? If yes, how long would you serve in this office?
\
Yes. I would serve no more than two terms in office.
\
4. Do you believe changes are necessary in the state's child welfare system to ensure it does not violate parents' rights? If the system is out-of-balance and needs some changes, what specifically do you recommend?
\
Striking an appropriate balance is the key challenge. Our children must be safe and must be given the support and nurturing they need to become healthy and productive adults. The long-term social impacts of child abuse and neglect are severe and costly. Children need safe and secure home environments. We must work to provide families with skills and support to foster such environments. Unfortunately, there are times when a child's home environment is unsafe, and best efforts fail to correct the problems in the home. In such cases, we have an obligation to prevent, to the extent possible, injuries that diminish a child's chances for a healthy and happy life. We must balance parental rights with parental responsibility. Protection of children and respect for family privacy are both important values.
\
We should support the Office of Parental Defense. Utah recently established this office to assist parents accused of child abuse and neglect. Many parents accused of such violations believe the state's child welfare system is stacked against them. Protecting children from abuse and neglect is critical, and we must never compromise our commitment to their safety. Nevertheless, the state must not penalize children by unjustly punishing their parents, or by inappropriately limiting parents' roles. By supporting the success of the Office of Parental Defense, we can build assurance that parents have access to appropriately trained counsel and that Utah's child welfare system will have the proper balance it needs.
\
The DCFS agency has been under close scrutiny since a federal lawsuit was filed in 1993 against the state for failure to protect children adequately. The agency is still under the supervision of a federal judge. DCFS has made progress in meeting its child welfare responsibilities and in meeting federal standards. During the last five years, Utah's federal review scores have improved in the areas of stability of children in foster homes, ensuring appropriate child placements, meeting health care needs of children in agency custody, and providing educational services. In addition, Utah is among the top states for the shortest lengths of stay in foster care and in moving children into homes of adoptive parents.
\
My concerns include the need to achieve further progress in meeting performance standards, including the area of helping families learn how to help themselves. DCFS has worked to form Child and Family Services Teams to work with families on services that would contribute to family well-being. The agency also needs to overcome staffing problems arising from turnover and inexperience. DCFS further needs to secure stronger community support to address social problems such as substance abuse and domestic violence that aggravate family problems, especially for children.
\
Abused and neglected children are particularly vulnerable. We must not compound the challenges they face. To better assess and meet the needs of foster children, the DCFS, the juvenile courts, guardians, foster parents, and public and private service providers must better coordinate their efforts. Every child in our foster care system needs to be adequately placed, with relative or kinship placements where possible, and monitored, with family involvement if possible, to ensure that each child's needs are sufficiently met.

5. A lawmaker recently proposed eliminating the asset test for children to qualify for Medicaid, allowing 7,000 additional children to get insurance. While the proposal would have cost several million dollars, the idea would be to fund it through a cigarette tax increase. Would you support such a proposal?
\
Foremost among the state's public health insurance programs is Medicaid. The federal government pays nearly three quarters of the cost of this program. The benefits of Medicaid for people with low incomes and for the state health care system should be extended by adjusting eligibility to cover more of those without health insurance, particularly opening Medicaid to more low-income children.
\
Utah's children should have access to quality health care, but approximately 80,000 of our children are uninsured. Effective programs such as Medicaid and CHIP provide important health services to many of Utah's needy children, but these programs are not fully utilized.
\
Currently in Utah, a low-income family that qualifies for Medicaid based on its income will not qualify for the program if the family has modest assets. In other words, if a low-income family owns a modest car or savings account, it may not qualify for Medicaid, depending on the value of these assets. Utah is one of only four states that have not eliminated this asset test for children. As a result, 6,000 to 7,000 Utah children in households with incomes below the federal poverty level are enrolled in CHIP instead of Medicaid. Elimination of the asset test would allow these children to enroll in Medicaid, which is a more comprehensive health program that is intended for children in families living below the federal poverty level. This, in turn, would open up the CHIP program to more Utah children. Until we can fully accomplish this goal, an interim step would be to explore raising the asset threshold amounts. Utah traditionally relies on the cigarette tax to fund health-related programs, and we should consider this option to help fund these changes.
\
6. Some lawmakers want the state Department of Health to implement a preferred drug list to keep prescription costs down for consumers. Would you favor or disfavor a preferred drug list?
\
Prescription drugs are a vital component of our health care system and an important consideration in our personal budgets. Many ailments that were once deemed untreatable, or otherwise required treatment with invasive procedures, are now routinely and successfully treated with prescription drugs. But these advances have come at a price that is unaffordable for many Utahns. According to state reports, about one fourth of older Utahns take five or more prescription drugs on a regular basis. Nearly a fourth of Utahns age 55 and older spend at least $100 per month on out-of-pocket prescription expenses, and six percent spend $200 or more per month.
\
I support the consideration of a preferred drug list to help Utah's Medicaid program manage the problem of increasing drug costs. Utah Medicaid spent $159.5 million for drugs in 2003, an increase of 18.6 percent from 2002. The Utah Department of Health estimated that responsible use of a preferred drug list would save $3 million dollars per year, which could be used for useful extensions of eligibility and coverage. This program could also be useful in coordination with multi-state purchasing pool plans (as discussed below). I would only support a preferred drug list, however, that includes necessary safeguards, including proper consideration of physician discretion.
\
There are many other important measures we should take to contain the rising costs of prescription drugs:
\
-- Examine the role of generic prescription drugs. Many patients and providers are simply unaware of generic alternatives. Although generic prescription drugs are promising, we must be certain that they provide the same benefits as their non-generic counterparts. Once it is determined that a generic prescription drug provides equivalent therapeutic benefits, educational programs should encourage the use of these lower-cost prescription drugs.
\
-- Encourage statewide efforts to help Utahns obtain safe and affordable prescription drugs. Utah's Prescription Drug Assistance Program, which provides information about obtaining drugs at reduced cost, is a positive step in this effort. The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and Area Agencies on Aging provide similar assistance.
\
-- Manage our publicly financed health insurance programs to cut prescription drug costs, and extend these savings to others. We should explore the possibility of state government, perhaps in concert with other states, sharing the savings it negotiates for Medicaid with low-income persons. Such programs, which utilize the purchasing power of the state, have successfully improved the availability of affordable prescription drugs in other states.
\
This spring, the Secretary of Health and Human Services approved multistate purchasing pool plans proposed by five states. By pooling their purchasing power, these states expect to obtain significant discounts on prescription drug medications. Because of the initiative taken by these states, the citizens of Alaska, Michigan, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Nevada may collectively save over $12 million in 2004. Utah can and should explore the advantages of entering into such an arrangement with other states so that Utahns can enjoy the same cost savings.
\
Utah's purchasing power, exercised alone or through a purchasing pool, could be used to save on the cost of prescription drugs. These savings could then be used to assist people with low incomes who are uninsured. Ohio's system provides an intriguing model. In 2002, that state distributed discounts to those with disabilities and those over 60 years of age (and, more recently, to underinsured and uninsured persons below 250 percent of the poverty line). With gubernatorial and legislative support, we could do the same in Utah.

\
7. As we saw recently, a family had to seek an abortion for a severely deformed fetus (which could not survive outside the womb) from a clinic because her hospital refused to perform the late-term abortions because a law passed by the 2004 Legislature restricts public funding for entities that perform abortions. The new law doesn't make allowances for the health of the fetus or the mother. In light of these problems, do you still favor or still oppose the new law? If oppose, how should the law be changed?
\
When this bill was being debated, my running mate, Sen. Karen Hale, proposed an amendment that would have provided an exception for fetuses known by competent medical authority to have fatal defects. As the author of the original bill later acknowledged, the bill should permit an exception for fatally deformed fetuses.
\
8. Do you favor or oppose the tuition tax credit bill proposed in the 2004 Legislature by Rep. Jim Ferrin? If you would have signed the bill as governor, what specifically will you do to help that bill, or one similar to it, be passed in the 2005 Legislature? If you oppose Ferrin's bill, what is your plan to move forward on the school choice issue?
\
The Utah public school system should offer alternatives to parents that best suit their students' education interests and needs. I propose a Public School Choice Initiative that features accountability and includes the following components:
\
A. Support Charter Schools -- Charter schools offer exciting opportunities for flexibility and choice in the public school system. They also encourage parent involvement and experimentation. Utah has taken an appropriately prudent approach to establishing charter schools. As we continue to explore more charter options, we need to ensure that charter schools are accessible to students and meet the same accountability standards as our traditional public schools, including teacher certification. We also need to be assured that each charter school is financially sound and does not deplete funding from the school district in which it is located. Finally, the new Charter School Board charged with oversight of charter schools should be asked to monitor and evaluate progress in our charter school programs and to share information that would improve all public schools.
\
B. Encourage School Choice -- Where population levels allow, many students already take advantage of school choice within and between school districts. For example, one out of five students in the Salt Lake City District and one out of eight in the Granite District have chosen to attend a school outside of their neighborhoods. We should encourage a broader range of classroom experiences within schools and among schools, making school choice even more meaningful. We should support efforts to provide parents and students with flexibility and the information to make good school choice decisions.
\
C. Oppose Tuition Tax Credits/Vouchers -- A program providing tuition tax credits or vouchers for parents who send their children to non-public schools would take Utah in the wrong direction. Over 95 percent of Utah children attend public schools. Our public education system is open to exciting new reforms, the flexibility and new ideas of charter schools, and furthering the state's tradition of quality. It also is under financial stress and in need of a statewide reaffirmation of commitment to public education. I am concerned that tuition tax credits will be ineffective in improving education in general, will take resources from the public system, and will send the wrong message to the vast majority of parents who are counting on the public schools to serve their children.
\

\
9. How can Utah prepare for 145,000 new public education students entering schools over the next decade? Be specific. Should the Legislature give local school districts more flexibility in assessing their own taxes? Should we just gut out the influx, counting on dropping student numbers in years ahead?
\
Funding for education in Utah has been a priority and a challenge. We devote all of our state income tax revenue to the Uniform School Fund, and school districts also rely on property tax revenues to fund their schools. More funding is not the sole answer to our education challenges. But the student growth we face and the quality improvements we need will require resources. It is critical for Utah to have a long-term funding plan for education. That plan must be the product of collaboration as outlined above. The following are some of the initial steps I would propose in developing this plan.
\
A. Education First -- Education is a high priority in Utah. It must be an even higher priority if we are going to meet the challenges of student growth and improving our schools. The percentage of the state's budget devoted to education over the years has declined slightly. As governor, my budget plan would fund education first and give it a higher percentage of the budget. I would urge the Legislature to do the same. For example, if our current commitment of 47.6 percent of state general revenues to education could be raised to 50 percent in the next four years, the yield would be an additional $89 million, based on current revenues. We must try to do this without raising taxes, which will require careful balancing of other legitimate public interests. The task will be hard, but the Education First budget commitment should help set the course to improving education in Utah.
\
B. Economic Development -- The most critical factor affecting our ability to finance education and other important public responsibilities is a healthy and growing state economy. Economic growth, and especially growth that brings high-quality, high-paying jobs, is essential to improving education in Utah. Economic growth and education are inextricably linked as top priorities, and I am fully committed to do all I can for the state to succeed in both. Our economy will not reach its full potential without a strong education program. Indeed, a robust economy starts with education, and that is what this Pledge to Education paper is about. Conversely, our education system will not reach its full potential without a strong economy. My plans for economic development are set forth at www.mathesonforgovernor.com.
\
C. Government Efficiency -- A vital part of planning for education is to conduct an aggressive, wholesale review of state government and state finances. On my first day as Governor, I will:
\
-- Appoint an Efficiency in Government Commission whose charge will be to conduct a wholesale review of state government, identify waste and duplication, and recommend budget cuts and cost-saving reforms. I will ask representatives from state and local government, business, and community organizations to participate. I will ask them to put state government on the Matheson CARB Diet -- Cut All Redundant Bureaucracy. The Commission will have a two-year term, and it will issue reports and recommendations every six months.
\
-- Ask public education to conduct the same wholesale review of the school system, and involve a diverse spectrum of expertise in the process. Although the education budget is stretched, we owe it to the taxpayer citizens of Utah to search aggressively for savings. The Matheson CARB Diet applies especially here, because savings in administrative overhead costs and elimination of redundant testing and reporting requirements can be well-invested in the classroom. The Utah school system has less administrative overhead than counterparts in other states, but we should continue to find appropriate cost-saving measures that will put more money into our classrooms. I will also support incentives for each school district that is able to shift funds from non-instructional functions and into classroom teaching.
\
D. School LAND Trust Program -- At statehood, Utah received millions of acres of land to be held in trust for the benefit of public schools. Revenue produced from these parcels goes into the Permanent School Fund, and interest income from the fund goes directly to our schools for their greatest needs. Much progress has been made to manage these lands and the revenues they produce to increase resources available to education. We need to continue with best efforts to build up the Permanent School Fund as a larger source of support for our schools. Part of those efforts should include a reinvigorated effort to trade isolated trust land parcels for more economically productive lands.
\
E. Federal Dollars, No Strings -- Education should remain a local responsibility. Utah's Governor must lead the fight against the federal government to keep it that way. The state also must take full advantage of federal resources available for education, including Title I, Head Start, School Lunch, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and other program funding. The task is to maximize federal resources because we need all we can get, and to preserve local control because parents and teachers know what we need.
\
F. Payments for Federal Lands -- Almost two-thirds of Utah is federal land that is not subject to property taxes. Our tax base to support education would be much larger if this were not the case. As a matter of fairness, counties receive from the federal government payments in lieu of taxes (PILT) to compensate them for the federal land not subject to tax. But the current payments do not nearly make up the difference in lost tax base. In the name of education and equity, the Governor and all leaders from the public land states in the West should mount an aggressive campaign for federal legislation to increase the PILT payments, with some of the increase going to support local classroom instruction.
\
G. Close Tax Loopholes -- Over the past several decades, numerous state tax exemptions have been added, amounting to over $500 million in foregone revenue. Exemptions that made sense and were justified at the time they were enacted may not make sense many years later. When budgets are so stretched and many individuals and businesses do not have the benefit of tax exemptions, it seems fair that the case be made for each exemption every five years. The Legislature should be asked to re-enact the exemptions that can be justified and allow those to expire that are no longer needed. By closing those loopholes, more revenue will be available for pressing budget needs.
\
H. Collect Taxes Owed -- I support stronger efforts to collect all taxes that are owed. The vast majority of individuals and business pay their fair share. The state currently is not adequately staffed to achieve greater compliance. More resources for tax audit and collection will generate more revenues for the state without raising taxes.
\
I. Tax Review -- I do not believe our citizens would or should support new taxes for education without exhausting all of the foregoing strategies. I do think we need a comprehensive review of our tax system to make sure it is fair and efficient. Governor Walker initiated such a review, and we need to build on the work that has been done. Just as the Commission on Government Efficiency should produce cost savings that can be used for education, a thorough review of our tax system should indicate areas of reform and efficiency that will produce more revenue without raising taxes. Income tax brackets, which have not been indexed for inflation and have not received material change for over 30 years, should be adjusted to meet today's circumstances.

10. The state gasoline tax has not been raised since 1997, when it went up to help pay for reconstruction of I-15 in Salt Lake County. When tax revenues dropped off in the early 2000s, lawmakers and the former governor took sales tax revenue out of roads and bonded. How do we pay for more road repairs now, including rebuilding I-80 on the east side of Salt Lake County?
\
To maintain our quality of life and improve our economic vitality, we must invest wisely in our transportation infrastructure. Of course, funding is tight, and several projects have been deferred due to a lack of funds. In 2002, UDOT cancelled nine road projects worth $21 million due to a lack of funds. At the same time, over $2 billion of future highway projects were unfunded. Furthermore, federal-to-local matching grants for local transit have decreased from 80/20 to 50/50, and a large portion of the recent Centennial Highway projects were financed by allocations from the state general fund that otherwise could have gone to education and other services. Although the task will not be easy, we must find funding for transportation investments.
\
A. Shortfalls in Highway and Mass Transit Funding.
\
Utah's transportation needs over the next 25 years have been estimated at over $30 billion. Based on current levels of funding, this will result in a funding deficit of $23.6 billion. Utah's residents and businesses need a plan to ensure that our transportation needs are met. Inadequate transportation funding threatens our safety and our quality of life.
\
-- Congestion. Congestion is increasing throughout the state, particularly in northern Utah County. A recent national study, ""The 2004 Urban Mobility Report,"" ranked the Salt Lake metropolitan area the sixth most-congested region of its size in the country, with the average commuter stuck in traffic delays for an average of 32 hours per year. This represents significant time away from our families and recreational activities. At current funding levels, the amount of time Utahns spend in traffic congestion per year will nearly triple in the next 25 years.
\
-- Safety. Some of our roads, like U.S. 6 from Green River to Springville, pose safety risks and need maintenance.
\
-- Conflicts between traffic and adjoining land uses. Many of these conflicts, such as the interstate truck traffic through downtown Moab, require immediate attention.
\
Although Wasatch Front residents now have the beginnings of a successful light rail system, our support for mass transit is insufficient. We spend less per capita on transit than almost every other metropolitan area. Per capita spending on UTA's system is $31 per person per year, while Denver spends $56, and Dallas $99. Other regional rivals, Portland and Seattle, respectively spend $111 and $125 per person on transit. Nationally, the average per capita spending in metropolitan areas served by a transit system is $68. Failure to plan for and invest in preserving rights-of-way for future light-rail lines will limit the coverage of a regional transit system and amount of transit oriented development for generations to come.
\
Utah citizens and businesses deserve a more complete transportation approach, and we need to adequately fund programs that most efficiently address our needs.
\
B. Finding Innovative Ways to Fund Transportation Projects
\
Finding adequate, long-term transportation funding will not be an easy task, but it is one we must face. Currently, there are several groups working on transportation funding plans--a legislative task force, the Utah League of Cities and Towns, the Utah Transit Authority, metro planning organizations, the private sector, and others--but there needs to be more opportunity for these stakeholders to coordinate their efforts. These groups are considering a variety of possible funding sources, including leveraging federal grants, state bonding, and adjustments to the gas tax.
\
Immediately following the election, I will call for a Transportation Funding Forum that brings together all major stakeholders. I will ask this group to formulate a comprehensive funding plan that carefully considers all reasonable approaches to present to the 2005 legislative session.
\
Although the task will not be easy, we must confront the difficult choices that will shape our future. In many ways, transportation is the backbone of our economy and our quality of life. That's why we must plan today to ensure a desirable tomorrow.
\
I also support the following measures to help fund Utah's transportation projects:
\
-- Creating Public/Private Partnerships that Can Reduce Government Expenditures on transportation projects without reducing the quality of the product. States across the country are experimenting with innovative methods for building and maintaining roadways. Washington, Arizona, and Michigan, among others, have found use of performance-based warranties an efficient way to build and maintain roads. These agreements give private contractors flexibility in how to complete a transportation project, but in exchange require the contractor to meet overall specifications and provide a long-term warranty for the work.
\
-- Employing Design-Build and Incentive Contracting. Design- build contracts assign both the design and construction responsibilities to a single firm, and also allow some construction to ensue before the design is completed. By employing this method, UDOT was able to complete reconstruction of I-15 under budget and three months ahead of schedule. This method reduces administrative costs of state highway agencies, can reduce or eliminate claims resulting from errors during construction, and allows builders flexibility in selecting innovative designs and construction techniques. Design-build contracting and performance-based warranties can also be combined with incentive contracts, which speed road construction by penalizing contractors who finish projects late and reward those who complete them ahead of schedule.
\
Utah needs a strong transportation infrastructure to support our rapid growth, changing economy, and quality of life. As governor, I will achieve a long-term financial base for our transportation system. Utah businesses and citizens need a comprehensive transportation plan that adequately funds efficient and effective transportation projects.

11. Do you believe the state gasoline tax must be adjusted upwards for inflation during your first term in office?
\
See answer to question 10.
\
12. Utah is in its sixth year of drought. Water development is a long-term effort. Specifically, what would you do to conserve water, to develop more fresh water?
\
Water has fed Utah's progress since statehood and is critical to our future. Industrious water development has allowed Utah to build thriving, beautiful communities rising from the desert. Nevertheless, without decisive action in the face of persistent drought, expanding demands on our limited water supply will threaten our continuing prosperity and quality of life. My administration will address this challenge with vision, practicality, and strong leadership.
\
I will work with all interests in the state to develop a comprehensive, balanced water management plan. This plan will strive to ensure adequate supplies of clean water for our homes, farms, and businesses, as well as for the rivers and streams that sustain fish and wildlife and contribute significantly to our economy, health, and quality of life. Water management in the Matheson Administration will focus on the following principles:
\
A. Public Involvement in Water Management Decisions. To be accepted and effective, a water plan must reflect the broad interests in our state. We must draw on the talent and expertise of Utah's citizens in crafting that plan.
\
B. Respect for Existing Water Rights. Water rights are valuable property rights that help the state use its water resources productively. We must respect those rights and protect them from unwarranted state or federal interference.
\
C. Effective and Efficient Use of Water Supplies. Conservation is the easiest and least expensive way to ensure sufficient water for our growing state. As a necessary complement to new water development projects, we must make the best use of what has already been developed. We should work to reduce per capita water use in Utah by:
\
-- Establishing a more aggressive state water conservation goal in coordination with water providers and users.
\
-- Promoting reasonable conservation measures through public education, incentives, and technology. Among other things, we should eliminate disincentives to water conservation, enforce the Utah Water Conservation Plan Act, encourage water providers to operate their systems in a more integrated way, develop increased capacity to reuse wastewater, encourage development and use of new technologies, and upgrade infrastructure to reduce water loss from leaks.
\
D. Protect Utah's Water through Smart, Efficient Development. Even with aggressive conservation, rapid population growth will require us to develop new water supplies. In addition, we must take the steps necessary to protect Utah's allocation of water from the Colorado River. To achieve these goals, we must:
\
-- Take action to secure rights of way and funding for proposed projects to develop water from the Colorado River and the Bear River and ensure that those projects minimize cost and environmental damage. Among these projects are the final pieces of the Bonneville Unit of the Central Utah Project that will bring water from the Colorado River drainage to the Wasatch Front; a proposed pipeline to deliver water from Lake Powell to St. George and, possibly, Cedar City; a pipeline from the Flaming Gorge Reservoir; and a reservoir and pipeline to store and deliver water from the Bear River.
\
-- Pursue ""smart"" water development methods that are less costly and damaging to the environment, such as increasing capacity in existing reservoirs, off-stream development, and aquifer storage and recovery.
\
-- Until our Colorado River supplies are fully developed, explore opportunities to lease temporarily Utah's unused water to other states, but only on the condition that it can be done without jeopardizing Utah's allocation.
\
-- Resolve Native American water rights claims by negotiating agreements that provide for the legitimate needs and interests of Native Americans and meet the other demands of our growing state.
\
E. Develop and Implement a More Comprehensive State Drought Response Plan. I will work with water providers and water users to prepare a comprehensive plan outlining specific steps that can be taken to mitigate the impacts of drought. In addition, I will propose consideration of a voluntary water bank and promote voluntary, basin-specific drought-response strategies.
\
F. Provide State Assistance to Local Water Suppliers. State government must coordinate closely with local entities such as local governments, public utilities, water conservancy districts, improvement districts, and others; understand their operations and challenges; and provide them with necessary technical and financial support to achieve statewide water management goals.
\
G. Assure High-Quality Water. To protect the quality of our water resources, I propose to:
\
-- Expand upon existing initiatives to protect the health of Utah's watersheds.
\
-- Implement targeted water quality initiatives such as maintaining the integrity of sensitive riparian and floodplain corridors, promoting water resource education, supporting the ""Utah Strategy"" for addressing runoff from animal feeding operations, addressing stormwater runoff, enforcing the requirements of the Clean Water Act, and increasing protection for drinking water aquifers.
\
My water plan, entitled ""We Can Do Better: A Pledge to Secure Utah's Water Future,"" includes a detailed discussion of water conservation. It is available on my Web site at www.mathesonforgovernor.com.
\
Should the current state sales tax dedicated to water development be removed, as former governors have suggested, and thus local water districts take on more of the development effort?
\
Currently Utah law provides for 1/16-cent of the sales tax to help fund water and wastewater projects at the local level. This source of funding has been critical to many areas throughout the state. Our water infrastructure needs are so great, including both new projects and repairs, that this allocation should continue. We should further consider whether the cap on this funding source should continue in its present form. In the long term, we need to explore alternative sources of funding, continue to support local water project needs, and work to achieve flexibility in the general fund. We also need to develop a long-term financing strategy, including bonding and federal funding consistent with the statewide water planning process.

\
13. While former governors have been successful in ""trading out"" some state lands in wilderness study areas for other federal lands that can be developed, overall the wilderness issue in Utah has been stuck for more than 20 years. What specifically would you do to resolve the ongoing wilderness lands issue in Utah?
\
We need to move forward on this issue beyond the current stalemate. I support the steps that Gov. Olene Walker and Lt. Gov. McKeachnie have taken to develop constructive dialogue at the local level. Almost two-thirds of Utah is federally owned. Utah leaders and citizens must have the central voice in decisions about these lands. I believe in multiple use, balance, and respect for our cultural heritage. Careful and fair analysis and open dialogue should determine which public lands should be available for recreation, mining, grazing, and other traditional uses. Balance is the key to accommodating the various uses, including wilderness. Many uses have longstanding economic and cultural traditions that deserve support. Local government should receive more funds from the federal government for loss of tax base on the public lands. We also must receive full benefit for the state trust lands by moving aggressively to achieve land exchanges for more productive and valuable federal parcels
\
14. Do you favor or oppose any hazardous or radioactive waste of a higher degree of toxicity being allowed into Utah storage facilities? If yes, specifically what kind of waste could, and should, Utah take?
\
I oppose the proposals for the storage, even temporarily, of high- level nuclear waste in Utah. I oppose storage of ""hotter"" radioactive waste -- class B and C waste--in Utah. And I oppose the renewal of atomic testing in Nevada.
\
A. High-Level Nuclear Waste
\
The federal government is considering whether to allow Utahns to be exposed to the risk of transporting 40,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel through our most populated areas and indefinitely storing that fuel on the Skull Valley Goshute Indian Reservation only 45 miles from our most densely populated urban area. I strongly oppose this plan. In any context, a plan to store spent nuclear fuel in Utah, a state that has never used or generated any nuclear fuel, would be objectionable to most Utahns. Why should we bear the risks of storing other states' nuclear waste? It is unacceptable. The Skull Valley proposal provides examples of the unacceptable conditions that arise in storing nuclear waste:
\
-- The proposal is for storage of spent nuclear fuel, which will remain toxic for tens of thousands of years in a region of questionable seismic safety.
\
-- Given the political and scientific difficulty in identifying a permanent storage site for the nation's spent nuclear fuel, serious questions have been raised about whether the Skull Valley proposal would result in a temporary storage site. Although the safety standards used to evaluate the site assume it will be temporary, common sense and experience tell us that storage of nuclear fuel at the Skull Valley site could very well be permanent. Assurances of temporary storage are inadequate, especially when there is no specified deadline for removal.
\
-- The proposal contemplates storage of spent nuclear fuel within the driveway flight path of Hill Air Force Base's fighter jet training missions -- a path that sees approximately 4,000 flights per year and which has experienced crashes over the years.
\
-- Security questions need to be answered about protection of the site from terrorist attack.
\
-- The case has not been made that transporting the waste through numerous urban areas to Utah and storing these highly radioactive wastes 45 miles from our largest urban center will be safer than storing the casks at the nuclear power plants that generated them.
\
-- The federal government's design, management and regulation of the storage of high-level radioactive waste continue to raise serious concerns. Major problems have been identified by reports of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and of the Government Accountability Office and by a non-governmental analysis accepted for publication in Princeton's peer-reviewed journal, Science and Global Security.
\
I strongly oppose the proposal to store high-level nuclear waste in Utah and, as governor, will use all of the tools at my disposal to fight this proposal on every front. Beyond opposition to storing high-level nuclear waste at Skull Valley, it is important that the state work actively with the Skull Valley Goshutes to pursue economic development that offers better and safer job opportunities. Utah should demand open and technically complete assessments of the Skull Valley and other proposals, just as we once did for the proposal to base MX missiles in Utah and Nevada in 1979-80. Another example occurred about 20 years ago when Utah took the initiative to apply scientific analysis to the two possible high-level nuclear waste sites in Utah (Lavender Canyon and Gypsum Dome) that were part of the initial list of potential depositories. This analysis used solid science to document the problems of these sites and their risks to Utah and the Colorado River. It helped make these sites among the first to be dropped from further investigation. Utah must be concerned about the transportation of nuclear waste if storage sites are located in the West. The federal government has the ultimate legal authority to regulate the interstate transportation of wastes. But Utah still can exercise influence through skilled use of federal laws, persistent and constructive negotiation with federal agencies, and committed and effective mobilization of political support. We must secure better support for Utah's interests in route selection, monitoring, and emergency preparedness for transportation through Utah of high-level wastes to any sites.
\
B. ""Hotter"" Radioactive Waste
\
I oppose allowing so-called ""hotter radioactive waste"" -- Classes B and C waste -- to be transported to and stored in Utah. Proposals for hazardous waste disposal sites must be assessed carefully using intensive cost/benefit and scientific analyses to ensure the safety of our own generation and future generations. And, as governor, I will advocate for the relocation of the radioactive tailings pile now located on the banks of the Colorado River near Moab. These positions are based on health and safety concerns and also on a desire to foster an image of the state that emphasizes our clean environment and natural beauty. I believe this position serves the best long-term economic development and quality-of-life interests of Utah.
\
Currently, Utah allows disposal of Class A radioactive waste. Classes B and C wastes pose significantly greater risks to our citizens. These so-called ""low-level"" wastes, commonly referred to as ""hot"" waste, can be thousands of times more radioactive than Class A waste. A legislative task force is studying this issue. It is highly doubtful that the potential revenue stream from taxing these wastes will adequately compensate Utah for the regulatory costs of ensuring safety, much less compensate our state for the public health risks. Beyond these costs is the damage to our state's reputation and image if we become known as the place for dumping radioactive wastes.
\
C. Testing
\
The federal government failed to protect the people of Utah from the radioactive fallout produced by the nuclear testing conducted in the 1950s and 1960s in our neighboring state of Nevada. I am far from convinced that safety provisions provided in present proposals are adequate for either temporary or permanent storage of high- level nuclear wastes. Utah must have a voice in nuclear armaments policy that may affect the West and the health of our citizens. Utah learned a sorry lesson from the health problems resulting from atomic testing half a century ago: trust alone does not protect Utah's health and safety. It was this lesson that led Utahns to force an open debate and a reconsideration and abandonment of the MX missile proposal. I am opposed to resumption of nuclear testing in Nevada. We should insist that Utah's interests and concerns are respected in the policy debate over this issue.

\
15. Explain your stand on gay marriage in Utah, will you be supporting Amendment 3 on Utah's November ballot?
\
Like most Utahns, I support traditional marriage as currently defined by Utah law--as between a man and a woman. I have concerns, however, about the proposed amendment.
\
The second sentence of the proposal goes beyond defining marriage and threatens the rights of other domestic relationships, such as hospital visitation and medical decision-making.
\
The second sentence is ambiguous. It was hastily considered in the final days of the Legislature -- not the careful and responsible way most constitutional change occurs in Utah. The Utah Constitutional Revision Commission, on which I served for a number of years, is normally asked to review and study proposed constitutional amendments. In this instance, that important process was ignored.
\
In addition, the adoption of the second sentence could have a negative impact on Utah's economic development. Almost half of all Fortune 500 companies and a number of Utah businesses now offer health benefits based on domestic relationships. I believe that we can, and should, support traditional marriage in Utah without creating an unfriendly business environment.
\
Concerns with the second sentence have caused Utah's attorney general, the past two attorneys general, and all of Utah's attorney general candidates to oppose Amendment 3. Gov. Walker also has expressed concerns. As one who has studied and taught constitutional law for many years, I agree with their analysis.
\
16. Do you favor the open space issue which now also will be on the ballot?
\
I support the ""Open Space"" initiative on November's ballot. Based on current patterns, developed land in Salt Lake, Utah, and Davis Counties will grow from 370 square miles (as of 1998) to 695 square miles by the year 2020 -- an increase of 88 percent. The growth of developed urban areas along the Wasatch Front has taken place largely by converting agricultural lands into residential and commercial real estate. In Davis County alone, approximately 700 acres of farmland are converted to urban development each year. Development also climbs further and further up our mountain slopes.
\
Although the state Legislature enacted the Quality Growth Act in 1999 -- which was designed to provide planning assistance to local governments, administer the LeRay McAllister Critical Land Conservation Fund, and make recommendations to the legislature on growth issues --funding for open space protection has been limited.
\
Indeed, while states like Nevada, with 87 percent public land ownership, have mobilized funds to protect their open space, Utah has continued to reduce its funding. Nevada recently passed a $200 million general obligation bond to preserve agricultural lands, habitat, and other critical open space. In contrast, during the 2003 legislative session, the Utah legislature reduced funding for open space acquisition to $450,000. During the 2004 legislative session, the legislative leadership again scuttled open space funding. Cutting state funds committed to open space preservation is expected to result in a loss of $16 million in federal matching funds to preserve critical farmlands.
\
I agree with a recent Deseret Morning News editorial that supported this measure:
\
""Imagine what Salt Lake City would be like today if early leaders hadn't set aside enough open space to create Liberty Park. Now imagine what the future would be like if people today don't protect the banks of the Jordan River, create new parks, protect wildlife and preserve cultural and historic landmarks . . . . (F)armland is giving way quickly to a bumper crop of asphalt and concrete. The time is here to either save (open space) or lose it. . . . ""
\
Clearly, Utahns agree as well. Polls show that up to 88 percent of Utah residents think that ""conserving open space plays a very important role in preserving Utah's quality of life.""
\
As governor, I will support the efforts of the Quality Growth Commission to protect open space. The longer we wait to implement open space protection, the more difficult it will be to find open space to protect.

\
17. Do you favor or oppose hate-crime legislation? If yes, do you favor classifications of victims, and if so, do you specifically favor higher penalties for those who attack homosexuals because of their sexual orientation?
\
I favor hate-crime legislation that punishes crimes motivated by bias or prejudice against a victim's race, color, gender, disability, age, nationality, ancestry, sexual orientation, or religion. This legislation has also been supported by the editorial boards of the Deseret News and other newspapers, KSL television and radio, our Attorney General, the Utah Sentencing Commission, and many others.
\
18. As it stands now, citizens with concealed weapons permits may legally take their guns into public schools. Do you favor or oppose the current practice?
\
I support the rights protected under the Second Amendment and under the Utah Constitutional provision on the right to bear arms. Like other important rights, there are appropriate times and places for their exercise. For example, we do not generally allow guns in airports or courts, and I support similar limitations on having guns in schools or churches. Otherwise, I support law-abiding citizens having the right to own and carry firearms provided they have obtained appropriate permits.
\
19. As governor, would you support or oppose the University of Utah's current practice of controlling who can bring guns onto campus? What, if any, changes should be made to current state law relating to gun ownership and/or use?
\
I support the University of Utah's policy.
\
20. Utah's seat belt law for adults currently is a secondary offense. An adult can't be cited for not wearing his seat belt unless he is pulled over by law enforcement on some other moving violation offense and he is not wearing a seat belt. Should Utah have a primary seat belt law, which means if a cop sees you driving by not wearing your belt he can pull you over and cite you?
\
I support primary enforcement of seat belt use in Utah. Twenty- two states have now adopted primary seat belt laws. Strong seat belt laws and enforcement of those laws increase seat belt use. That saves lives and prevents injuries.
\
Our state also has a fiscal interest in encouraging Utahns to buckle up. The reauthorization of the federal Transportation Equity Act allocates transportation dollars to states that enact a primary safety belt law and/or achieve a seat belt usage rate of at least 90 percent. Utah could receive over $6.4 million federal dollars to be used for transportation projects. As noted in a previous answer, this is money that the state needs.
\
A primary seat belt law can also have a positive impact on reducing Medicaid payments by decreasing the number of preventable injuries that affect the state's health care budget. Millions of dollars are spent on inpatient and emergency room hospital charges for those who are unbelted. Additional money is spent on charges for surgery, rehabilitation, transportation, physicians, and medication. Businesses are paying the costs of wages to absent employees, compensation benefits, and a rise in medical insurance premiums.
\
21. Over the four years of your first term, how should Utah's tax structure be changed? What taxes cut? Should some be raised? What tax exemptions removed, changed, or given?
\
Utah's current tax system is based on yesterday's economy. We should build upon Gov. Olene Walker's leadership in calling for a thorough process of review and reform. This process should take the following factors into consideration:
\
-- Fairness. Income tax brackets have not materially changed in 30 years. Currently, most Utah taxpayers are in the top tax bracket. This means that many families with modest incomes are paying at the same rate as the highest-income taxpayers. We should examine tax reform proposals that address this and other equity issues.
\
-- Tax Collection. I support stronger efforts to collect all taxes that are owed. The vast majority of individuals and business pay their fair share. The state currently is not adequately staffed to achieve greater compliance. More resources for tax audit and collection will generate more revenues for the state without raising taxes.
\
-- Tax Exemptions. Over the past several decades, numerous state tax exemptions have been added, amounting to about $500 million in foregone revenue. Exemptions that made sense and were justified at the time they were enacted may not make sense many years later. When budgets are so stretched and many individuals and businesses do not have the benefit of tax exemptions, it seems fair that the case be made for each exemption every five years. The Legislature should be asked to re-enact the exemptions that can be justified and allow those to expire that are no longer needed. By closing those loopholes, more revenue will be available for pressing budget needs.
\
-- Sales tax on food. Due to concerns about its regressivity, eliminating the sales tax on food has been considered for many years. I support this goal provided two conditions are met. First, there must be a plan to replace the lost revenue. Second, we must have a plan to protect the tax base of local governments. I do not currently see a fiscally responsible way to do this without it being part of a broader tax reform effort and a determination that it is the best alternative to provide tax relief to working families.
\
Is the overall tax structure fair, or is one segment -- individuals, families with children, businesses -- paying too much or too little?
\
The tax burden is not spread fairly. A Task Force of the Tax Review Study Commission, a statutorily created body, completed a report on tax burden in 1999. It concluded that state and local taxes do not distribute the tax burden proportionately among all taxpayers. The burden is higher among lower and middle income taxpayers due to the sales tax on food and the erosion of the state's income tax brackets due to inflation. It further concluded that the tax system, without intervention, would become more regressive over time.
\
22. The above questions are aimed at finding out where you stand. Can you give us one (or more) reasons why voters should not pick your major-party opponent? For example, does he lack experience, education, vision, does he bring conflicts of interest or is he too closely associated with minority issues, etc.?
\
I'm running for governor because I strongly believe that we can do better for Utah. I'm asking for your vote because I have the experience, the creativity, and the plan to make that happen.
\
Utah is facing important crossroads on many important issues. In a Matheson Administration, you can be sure that education will always be my top priority. I will also focus on economic development and providing quality health care.

""These rights can't be a reality without the building and maintenance of safe roads.""\Children living on the reservation miss between five and 10 days of school each year due to impassable roads, Pehrson said.\Since 2005, San Juan County has contributed about $11 million to maintain bus routes within the Navajo Nation.\The county previously received $500,000 each year from the federal government to maintain Navajo roads, Pehrson said. That funding disappeared in 2005, leaving $90,000 from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and county transportation funds.\He said recent changes to state law ccc last year's gas-tax increase and a quarter-cent sales-tax increase approved by county voters ccc will bring the county close to breaking even on maintaining the current condition of reservation roads.\But a major upgrade of the bus routes, he said, is out of reach.\""We need more funding to improve the roads on the reservation,"" Pehrson said.\The coalition of tribal leaders and elected officials lobbied Congress for $25 million in annual funding for five years. That revenue was to be split among three states ccc Utah, New Mexico and Arizona ccc where the Navajo Nation is located.\In August, Utah Gov. Gary Herbert sent a letter to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, urging consideration of bus-route conditions within tribal lands.\""We must ensure all students, including Native American children, have access to the best education possible so they can compete in the global marketplace and reach their full potential,"" Herbert wrote.\With the debate over the transportation bill concluded, Pehrson said the coalition is still forming their strategy for next year.\Those efforts have focused on federal legislation, but he said the county and tribal leaders are open to working with state policymakers.\""I would hope that someone, state or federal, would help us,"" he said.\bwood@sltrib.com\Twitter: @bjaminwood\Credit: By Benjamin Wood The Salt Lake Tribune"
208,"It appears drivers will continue to get a free ride when it comes to covering the growing cost of air quality monitoring in Utah. Last week the Legislature's Interim Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment Committee put the brakes on a reasonable proposal that would have made drivers pay their fair share through nominal hikes in taxes or fees.\Now it's back to the drawing board for the Utah Department of Environmental Quality's Division of Air Quality. Department officials are trying to identify an annual funding stream of at least $3 million to pay for air monitoring, scientific studies and the drafting of a plan to bring the state into compliance with new, more-stringent federal Environmental Protection Agency regulations for fine particle pollution and ozone.\Failure to comply could result in limits on transportation projects, the loss of federal transportation funds or even a federal takeover of the state's air quality regulation program. And worse, failure to comply would result in continued risks to the public health, particularly for residents living along the Wasatch Front, where heavy traffic contributes to air pollution.\A DEQ stakeholders task force, composed of industry reps, lawmakers, DEQ officials and environmentalists, proposed a nominal increase in the gas tax and/or vehicle registration fees to help cover the cost of compliance. A tiny tax could raise a lot of money - a 2-cent tax on each 10 gallons of gas would net an estimated $3.5 million a year; a $1.96 increase in the annual vehicle registration fee would generate about $3.9 million.\The proposal made sense, considering that automobile emissions account for about half of the fine particle pollution in the state, while contributing heavily to the mix of chemicals that form ozone when baked under a hot summer sun. But the interim committee, which could have recommended legislation to put the plan in place, rejected the road map, and failed to suggest an alternative route.\Now DEQ will be forced to seek money for air quality planning directly from lawmakers, who have been less than forthcoming with funding for environmental programs. The agency's work force has been static for 15 years, and budget cuts from several years ago have never been restored.\The Legislature needs to stop treating the DEQ like an ugly stepchild, and give it the money it needs to do its job. Our health, and our lives, depend on it.\Now DEQ will be forced to seek money for air quality planning directly from lawmakers, who have been less than forthcoming with funding for environmental programs.\Credit: Tribune Editorial"
209,"In 2011, an attempt was made in the Utah Senate to increase the gasoline tax, but it was voted down. BallotPedia reports that in 2018, state tax on gasoline is 29.41 cents and federal tax is 18.4 cents, for a total tax of 47.81 cents per gallon. Since this tax started in 1923, it has grown at the rate of 3 percent per year. The Utah Legislature passed a law in 2015 that will automatically increase the tax yearly if average fuel price has risen (not to exceed 40 cents, based on “certain factors”).\The gasoline tax issue has been resurrected again in Utah. Our Schools Now, which had been pushing for a ballot measure for school funding in the November elections, agreed to a compromise with the Legislature. The legislative resolution passed in 2018 puts the proposition of a 10 cents per gallon increase in the state gasoline taxes to finance roads and, indirectly, education on the November ballot. If passed, it is only advisory.\The proposed increase in tax revenue will not be enough to meet the original aspirations of Our Schools Now to fund education. Using U.S. Department of Energy data on gasoline consumption in 2016, my estimates show that 10 cents per gallon tax will increase additional tax revenue by $124.69 million in 2018, $127.18 million in 2019 and $129.73 million in 2020, assuming 2 percent growth in gasoline consumption commensurate with population growth rate in Utah. Public education requires a large infusion of resources. This ballot measure is a small but important step in the right direction.\Logically, road and education financing sources should be separated. Selective highway tolls are an efficient way to finance roads, with the additional benefit of reduced congestion and pollution. The net effect of the price increase due to the gasoline tax, the growth in income and fuel-efficient motor transportation may result in smaller additional tax revenue to meet the needs for roads and education.\A better tax, given the heavy carbon dioxide (CO2) air pollution in Utah, is the carbon tax. Because it is a broad-based tax, its burden is distributed among all activities that emit CO2. Therefore, it has a great potential to raise substantial tax revenues and reduce CO2 at the same time.\Clean air is a common property resource. Therefore, any activity that uses it as a waste repository that causes harm to others should pay the price for the resource. Air pollution due to CO2 emissions results in costly damages to industries and human beings. A CO2 tax would be a market-based solution that would incentivize emitters of CO2 to use the least-cost strategy to control emissions. However, at the same time, it has a great potential to raise revenues in the foreseeable future to finance education and roads.\Professor William Nordhaus of Yale University reported in Economist Voice, September 2010, an optimum tax in 2015 prices would be between $12 and $25 per ton of CO2. It could be increased more if some of the revenue is used to decrease other market distortionary taxes, such as income tax that discourages work or a tax on savings that distorts capital accumulation. It could be adjusted by the inflation rate per year. In Utah, annual CO2 emissions from automobiles alone are close to 5.38 million tons in 2018, assuming 2 percent growth in vehicle ownership since 2016. If appropriately implemented, the carbon tax would stimulate economic growth in Utah due to a cleaner environment.\In summary, the gas tax is narrowly focused and only indirectly addresses the issues of CO2 reductions and highway congestion and it raises meager tax revenues. Besides other features outlined above, the CO2 tax distributes the burden of the tax, lessens the burden, if accompanied by reduction of other distortionary taxes, improves efficiency in markets and raises substantial amount of revenues, even if it is only levied on fossil fuels that contribute more than 90 percent of CO2 emissions.\Vijay K.

210,"Congress is poised to extend the Highway Trust Fund for two more months. This Band-Aid is needed because the fund's authorization expires at the end of May, and lawmakers haven't been able to agree to a more durable strategy to pay for America's roads.\In China, where I am at the moment, things are different. Despite this country's much lower per capita income, Chinese drivers pay noticeably more in fees per mile than American drivers do. The higher fees encourage people to use high-speed rail and other alternatives for getting around. And the money finances new and more efficient investments in highways.\It is absolutely correct, as my former colleague Larry Summers and others have argued, that today's low interest rates and sluggish economic activity provide an ideal environment for making needed improvements to infrastructure. And it would easily be possible to borrow the money for such projects, were it not for the political unwillingness to commit to some way of paying it back. An alternative to full public financing is the much-hyped public-private partnership model for infrastructure spending. That model, though, requires tolls or other forms of revenue; private investors demand a return, and that return necessitates an identifiable revenue source.\In the U.S., we are unwilling to levy either dedicated taxes (the federal gas tax hasn't been raised in more than 20 years) or charge tolls and other user fees.\There is one exception in American infrastructure, and that is the freight railroad system. In her book ""Move: Putting America's Infrastructure Back in the Lead,"" Rosabeth Moss Kanter explains that, although passenger rail lags behind, U.S. freight rail is a global leader, thanks to the system's ""financial profitability and reinvestment of profits in the improvement of infrastructure.""\Freight rail is not without its challenges, including some areas of congestion (especially around Chicago), questions about whether the industry is adequately prepared for the increase in cargo that will come with the expansion of the Panama Canal, and the controversies surrounding the safety of carrying oil from shale formations. But because the freight railroad companies have paying clients, they have the incentive and the resources to innovate and improve.\A new paper from the Hamilton Project lays out several ways in which we could facilitate user fees in the U.S. The federal government could, for example, establish a single national standard for electronic toll collection, perhaps through a smartphone application that would function much like an E-ZPass. The authors also suggest a set of national guidelines for congestion pricing, with variable user fees that depend on traffic flows and so reduce demand on infrastructure at peak times.\To be sure, not all infrastructure can or should be financed by users, which is why public-private partnerships are not the universal response to infrastructure needs. Furthermore, many other kinds of changes are needed before the U.S. can move forward with an ambitious infrastructure program. Overlapping federal, state and local regulations need to be sorted out, for example.\But Congress is kidding itself if it believes that it's possible to substantially expand investments for the future without asking users to pay more.\Peter R.

Fifty days.
\
That's how much later Utah's first caucuses are than Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses, which begin Feb. 1, 2016. And that's why most presidential candidates are going out of their way to keep Iowa's special interests happy, even if it hurts hardworking Utahns in the process.
\
One issue in particular stands out: the Renewable Fuel Standard. The RFS is a 2005 federal mandate that requires fuel refiners to blend biofuels - primarily corn-based ethanol - into gasoline.
\
It's a big deal in Iowa, which produces much of the ethanol the rest of us are forced to use, despite higher costs and dubious benefits.
\
The RFS amounts to a regressive gas tax. It harms low- and middle-class families in Utah and across the country by driving up the cost of gasoline and pushing down total miles per gallon. And despite its intentions, it actually harms the environment.
\
Consider the RFS' effect on gas prices. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated the RFS could raise prices at the pump by 13 to 27 cents per gallon by 2017, with diesel increasing by 30 to 51 cents. With Utah gas prices averaging around $3 per gallon today, the RFS could raise them by close to 10 percent or more.
\
This comes at a bad time for Utahns. Affordable gasoline has offered a lifeline to households currently struggling to make ends meet, providing the equivalent of a $700 tax cut per family since last June. The RFS will reverse this much-needed reprieve.
\
Making matters worse is that ethanol has a lower fuel economy than gasoline. So as the RFS requires increasingly more ethanol to be blended into your gas, it decreases the distance each gallon will take you. The result is more trips to the gas station and less money in your pocket.
\
And while the RFS was passed on promises that it would be environmentally friendly, in practice it has been anything but. When factoring in the additional farming and refining ethanol requires, the World Resources Institute found it does more harm than good.
\
Which begs the question: If the RFS is all pain and no gain, why would presidential candidates support it? Perhaps because Iowa's presidential caucuses, the first in the nation, come well before Utah's primaries - which supposedly makes their interests more important than ours.
\
The ethanol special interests in Iowa and Washington, D.C., are already betting the farm to keep the RFS alive. Lobbyists at the Renewable Fuels Association recently launched a multimillion-dollar PR campaign they described as ""the most aggressive issue advocacy effort people have ever seen in the history of the Iowa caucuses."" Their goal? To get White House hopefuls to support the RFS by dangling Iowa's votes.
\
Of course, Congress could easily take this issue off the table by repealing the Renewable Fuel Standard on its own. Half measures, such as legislation to repeal only the corn mandate, would make America's energy policy resemble California's, where gas prices are far and away the highest in the nation.
\
Americans may wish we had California's sunshine, but we don't need its high gas prices. The only acceptable solution is to repeal the mandate entirely. U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., has already introduced legislation that would do just that. Utahns should encourage their members of Congress to join him in passing it without delay.
\
Meanwhile, instead of focusing on how to get votes in just one state, presidential candidates should focus on what's good for the whole country. With the primaries and caucuses still nine months away, there's plenty of time to make sure the RFS gets the national attention it deserves. Opposing it should be an easy decision for principled candidates who side with American families over special interests.

212,"Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal issued a dire warning Thursday that if President Barack Obama is re-elected, the nation's energy sector would see ""continued hostility"" toward production and a potential cap-and-trade edict.\""You already see it in the first term,"" Jindal said. Leasing offshore is down 30 percent. ""We're already seeing a hostile regulatory environment that is diminishing production of energy.""\Jindal was in a town meeting with representatives from 17 energy companies, raising money for Gov. Gary Herbert's re-election campaign. Herbert has raised more than $235,000 from energy companies since his last election -- $1 out of every $6 he has raised.\Jindal has just been elected to a second term as governor of Louisiana and said he isn't interested in running as Mitt Romney's vice presidential candidate.\""I've got the job that I want,"" said Jindal, noting that he is just beginning to tackle retirement reform in his state and has other goals to accomplish.\But Jindal said he will do everything he can to get Romney elected and threw some tough charges at the Obama administration.\Jindal said that, if Obama is re-elected, he wouldn't be able to get a cap-and-trade bill through Congress, but he is concerned that the administration could try to achieve it through a ""regulatory fiat.""\And Jindal said that the Obama administration has brought America high unemployment and high deficits, and ""you've got a president who is leading us toward a European socialist-type government.""\The Obama campaign said Jindal is skewing the numbers.\""Here are the facts: President Obama has aggressively pursued an all-of-the-above energy strategy,"" said Obama campaign spokesman Tom Reynolds. ""As domestic oil production has reached an 8-year high and our dependence on foreign oil has fallen to a 16-year low, the president has also made historic investments in renewable energy, reduction of energy waste, the [research and development] of clean coal technology and expanded, safe natural gas extraction.""\Reynolds said that Romney raised the gas tax as Massachusetts governor, has opposed fuel economy standards, and supported tax breaks for oil and gas companies.\Jindal was flying to Colorado for a fundraiser there, then headed to New Mexico to raise money for Republican Gov. Susana Martinez before returning to Louisiana.\During Utah stop, Jindal says Obama would hurt energy\Rocky Mountain Roundtable\Gov. Gary Herbert will host his counterparts from Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada and Colorado on Friday to discuss energy, public land, water and other regional issues in a Rocky Mountain Roundtable.\""The hope is ... we'll start a dialogue that will bring governors together,"" Herbert said during his monthly KUED news conference. ""We're smaller-in-population states and don't have quite the political muscle.

John Hickenlooper, the only Democrat of the group, will also participate via teleconference.\Herbert said that, in addition to a discussion of public lands and access to natural resources, energy and water, the governors would also discuss endangered species issues and could potentially have a dialogue about immigration enforcement.\Herbert said that Hickenlooper, in particular, believes states should be doing more when it comes to immigration and is interested in Utah's approach.\Environmental groups have scheduled a protest at noon outside the Governor's Mansion during the meetings.\Credit: By Robert Gehrke The Salt Lake Tribune"

Take a quick look out the window. Is it raining?
\
I thought so.
\
Nothing snaps our attention to all those dire predictions about a long-term drought in the West quite like a winter without snow, followed by an early spring without rain.
\
Well, there was that nice little snowstorm on Christmas. It's as if the heavens listened to Utahns who are fond of saying, ""I hate snow, except at Christmas,"" or, ""I'd like it if the snow stayed in the mountains, and it just rained down here,"" and took them seriously.
\
Except, of course, it really didn't snow much in the mountains or rain much down here. When the state's water managers began meeting this week in St. George to talk about conditions, the snowpack statewide was at about 65 percent of what it ought to be, and reservoirs were at about 63 percent, according to a Deseret News story.
\
And that means, unless things change in a hurry, we're going to have to take some drastic action.
\
If so, may I suggest the folks in charge look at market-driven strategies for water conservation?
\
I know everyone ignored me when I suggested this for highway funding. It would be better for the state's transportation needs if it reduced gas taxes and imposed variable tolls on highways, I said, more than once.
\
I didn't just suggest it. I referred to reputable studies that found it would be fairer and better for the environment than the current system. And, to be fair, you didn't just ignore me. I read all the emails.
\
But the Legislature stuck with a gas tax hike anyway, despite knowing it won't collect enough money for highway needs as cars become more fuel-efficient, and people keep buying hybrids. Good luck with that.
\
But when it comes to water, if we're not careful, we run the risk of becoming like California, where some local governments have decided to sic people on each other. It's called drought shaming. All you have to do is read the first sentence of an Orange County Register story last August to see how that's going.
\
""The water ninjas are prowling the streets,"" the story begins. ""Mocking. Undercover. Often anonymous. They are watching you, snapping pictures of your wastefulness with their cellphones ...""
\
Then they post this on Twitter, Facebook or some other public place, along with something clever like, ""Congratulations for watering the pavement,"" as the Register reported.
\
The irony is, California water districts don't look at Twitter. They want people to report neighbors to them. But even that is an awful idea that could, as an L.A. Times opinion piece by Kerry Cavanaugh said, lead to ""neighborhood feuds.""
\
She also noted how unfair this practice is. Some people could water the asphalt all day and never hear a complaint, while others with meddlesome neighbors could get a citation every time they spilled a drop from a water bottle.
\
Last year, in the face of a drought, the state of Utah decided all users who access the Virgin River with water rights obtained after 1900 would have to stop irrigating.
\
That was an arbitrary decision. Supply and demand is more effective.
\
But before Utah gets to market-driven water conservation, it has to change how water districts are funded. Right now, a lot of them receive a good deal of money from property taxes. I'm not the first to suggest that this should go the way of the Water Wiggle. The first step is to make sure users pay the true cost of water, which is a lot more than what people currently pay.
\
The next step is to revamp what already is happening in many areas: Make the rates rise along with the amount of water customers use. Try this: Charge people less for drinking and showering than for watering their lawns, then give people smartphone apps that alert them when they're nearing a cutoff for higher rates.
\
The West's water challenges go beyond the need for conservation. According to Robert Johnson, former Bureau of Reclamation commissioner, a lot of dams need to be upgraded and protected against earthquakes, for instance.
\
But if we want to make sure everyone has something to drink before storm clouds come again, make conservation something people can't afford not to do.

214," WASHINGTON -- And now a kind word for a guest who put on his coat, closed the door behind him and left the party.\ Paul Tsongas was the only flat-out, totally admirable politician running in this year of smut, snarl and smear. Certainly he's a pol who left the 1992 mudbath as clean as the day he waded in.\ Sure, I know the knocks against Tsongas: Personality of a wet mop. A basset-eyed, sallow-faced nerd. Too self-righteous. A cancer survivor who didn't hide it. A bleak preacher with a sermon of economic pain and sacrifice.\ I guess that means Tsongas didn't look like Robert Redford, didn't bluster or turn pit-bull mean, or make a dozen pie-in-the-sky promises or let pollsters tell him how to do the popular thing.\ No wonder he lost.\ ""Nobody can argue with you, Paul,"" Bill Clinton rebutted during one debate. ""You're too perfect.""\ Saint Paul, the Clinton guys called him with curled lips. They never liked Tsongas's smug dig at Clinton, ""I'm not Santa Claus handing out steroids.""\ But Tsongas had wit, grace and fearlessness in telling Americans they had to save, work and rebuild our manufacturing base or accept defeat. ""The Cold War's over. Germany and Japan won it.""\ I can think of six reasons to admire Tsongas.\ Their names are Nunn, Bentsen, Gore, Bradley, Gephardt and Rockefeller.\ They backed out of the 1992 presidential race. Each had reasons. But the fact that George Bush's 90-point approval rating seemed invincible had to be prominent.\ Tsongas didn't scare. He sat down and wrote an 85-page pamphlet, ""An Economic Call to Arms."" His pro-growth remedies: Hike the gas tax a nickel, lower entitlements like Social Security for the wealthy, cut the tax bite on venture capital, buy American products. He used the story of a bone-marrow transplant that saved his life as metaphor: The American economy needed drastic Tough Love.\ OK, maybe his cure was wrong; Tsongas was the only '92 pol to hammer at the sickness: Revive the auto, electronics, steel and aerospace industries or become a nation of burger-flippers.\ But who'd vote for Dr. Bad News?\ Yep, Tsongas was a messenger without magnetism. Clinton's TV-ad buzzsaw chewed him up in Florida and Michigan. I thought he quit prematurely March 19, but who can argue with a $500,000 debt? The 2.8 million Tsongas votes show someone listened.\ ""I'm not in this to play the role of spoiler,"" Tsongas told Anybody-But-Clinton diehards urging him this week to do a back flip into the race.\ But Tsongas wouldn't go gently into the good night. In his farewell Thursday he banged hard at Democrats -- especially Clinton -- who imagine they can beat Bush with old promises, tinny rhetoric and negative ads.\ ""The drop in turnout has to terrify Democrats,"" said Tsongas. ""The Democratic Party can't be a happy camp. You can reverse that with a message that grabs people and gives them hope.""\ He shrugged off questions about Clinton's character. ""It's not the numbers. Where's the passion?"" said Tsongas. ""If you have a compelling message, the other issues fade away. If you're willing to say anything to get votes, you're perceived as no different than George Bush. You're in trouble in November.""\ Oddly, Tsongas held up three Republicans -- Bob Dole, Warren Rudman, Howard Baker -- as role models who would take tough stands.\ ""There's a cadre of people in the Senate ready to do what's necessary. Most are not,"" said Tsongas. ""How do you succeed in an environment where pandering works?""\ He plugged wild-card Ross Perot. ""His argument isn't dissimilar from mine,"" said Tsongas. ""Democrats, fill the vacuum before Ross Perot does it for you.""\ Listening, Bill Clinton?\ Tsongas finessed questions about a No. 2 spot on a Clinton ticket. A likelier choice is Sen. Bob Kerrey, whose war record makes him a foil against Dan Quayle. But insiders say Clinton and Tsongas, despite public savagery, had behind-the-scenes chemistry.\ For the Democrats' survival, it's more important that Clinton absorb Tsongas' hard-edged, pain-before-gain realism. That Tsongas finished second in New York -- without campaigning -- hints voters are hungry for answers more substantial than Clinton's cotton candy.\ ""People like me better when I stay on my front porch,"" joked Tsongas.\ Put together Clinton's exuberant, resilient campaign style and Tsongas's let's-compete-again message, Democrats might have a chance.\ ""I didn't feel I'd wasted a year of my life when I withdrew,"" said Tsongas. ""I felt fulfilled.""\ He was a Jeremiah with humor, guts and style. Given Warren Beatty's mug and Charlie Kuralt's voice, he might still be running. All Paul Tsongas had to sell was a piece of the truth.\ And he made history. Name another 51-year-old politician to flaunt his scrawny body on television in a Speedo bathing suit."
215,"Owners of electric and hybrid vehicles may soon face up to a five-fold increase in Utah registration fees — making them the highest in America — which critics say will hurt sales and harm efforts to reduce air pollution.\That comes as the House Transportation Committee on Monday advanced HB209 on 6-4 vote, which would increase the fees. The bill now goes to the full House.\Sen. Wayne Harper, R-Taylorsville, Senate sponsor of the bill, who handled the presentation of it for an ailing Rep. Kay Christofferson, R-Lehi, the bill’s main sponsor, said electric cars and hybrids now totally or largely escape gasoline taxes that fund road maintenance.\So, he said the proposed fee hikes would force them to pay more of what he says is their fair share. However, he says they would still pay perhaps 20% less than drivers of most gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles pay on average per year in fuel tax, still giving some incentive to clean-air vehicles.\The bill would raise the fees for electric vehicles (such as Tesla, KIA Soul or Nissan Leaf) from $120 to $300, up 150%.\Registration fees for plug-in hybrids (such as a Chevy Volt or PHEV) would quintuple from $52 to $260.\And fees for hybrid electric vehicles (such as a Prius) would rise from $20 to $50, up 150%.\“This bill would increase EV [electric vehicle] fees to the highest in the nation,” complained Rep. Suzanne Harrison, D-Draper, which was echoed by many critics. “This is the wrong policy at the wrong time and sends the wrong message” — and would hamper adoption of clean-air cars.\A long parade of clean air groups and activists agreed.\Grace Olscamp, a policy associate with the Healthy Environment Alliance of Utah, said the bill would shock “the system with increased fees that would prevent most citizens from ever affording these vehicles.” She said only 2% of cars on Utah roads are electric or hybrids, and more are needed to reduce pollution.\Elizabeth Converse, representing Silicon Commons, an advocacy group for technology companies, said it worries about what “we’re saying not only to your constituents, our Utah community, but also to the rest of the world” with high fees on clean-air vehicles.\Resident Robert Wheat said he is in the market for a new vehicle. While he would like an electric vehicle with no emissions, he said the fees and taxes would be far cheaper over the life of a new vehicle on a fuel-efficient gasoline-powered car with high mileage — so government is creating disincentives for people to move to cleaner vehicles.\Rusty Cannon, vice president of the Utah Taxpayers Association, disagreed with the objections.\He figures that electric vehicles now pay $261 a year less in registration and gas tax than a typical gasoline powered vehicle in Utah that he says gets 20 miles per gallon and travels an average 15,442 miles a year. With the proposed increase, he figures electric car owners would still pay $81 less than gasoline-powered cars.\That amounts to a 20% discount as an incentive for driving an environmentally friendly car, Cannon said. “You’re still going to pay less than the average gas driver does.”\Also, Utah offers a pilot program that could allow electric and hybrid car owners a chance to pay less if they drive less, called the Road User Charge program. It charges a monthly fee per mile driven, up to an annual maximum of what the registration fee would be otherwise. If the car is driven less than that amount, he or she pays less.\Cannon said the break-even point now for an electric vehicle is driving about 8,000 miles a year. With higher fees, the break-even point would be 20,000 miles a year — possibly encouraging more electric vehicle owners to switch to the road user program.\Officials in Utah hope to replace gasoline taxes entirely in a decade or so by switching all cars to a road user charge based on miles driven. Clean-air advocates pushed for a quicker conversion to avoid high fees on clean-fuel cars now, to possibly avoid what they see as a move to penalize these drivers.\Harper said he believes the bill will not hurt air quality and, “I believe it levels the field more for people who use the road, regardless of the type of fuel that they consume. And it moves us towards the future where we can have a more equitable mileage-based program for everyone.”\Crédito: Lee Davidson"

Affordable gasoline has offered a lifeline to households currently struggling to make ends meet, providing the equivalent of a $700 tax cut per family since last June. The RFS will reverse this much-needed reprieve.\Making matters worse is that ethanol has a lower fuel economy than gasoline. So as the RFS requires increasingly more ethanol to be blended into your gas, it decreases the distance each gallon will take you. The result is more trips to the gas station and less money in your pocket.\And while the RFS was passed on promises that it would be environmentally friendly, in practice it has been anything but. When factoring in the additional farming and refining ethanol requires, the World Resources Institute found that it does more harm than good.\Which begs the question: If the RFS is all pain and no gain, why would presidential candidates support it? Perhaps because Iowa's presidential caucuses, the first in the nation, come well before Utah's primaries ccc which supposedly makes their interests more important than ours.\The ethanol special interests in Iowa and Washington, D.C., are already betting the farm to keep the RFS alive. Lobbyists at the Renewable Fuels Association recently launched a multi-million PR campaign they described as ""the most aggressive issue advocacy effort people have ever seen in the history of the Iowa caucuses."" Their goal? To get White House hopefuls to support the RFS by dangling Iowa's votes.\Of course, Congress could easily take this issue off the table by repealing the Renewable Fuel Standard on its own. Half measures, such as legislation to repeal only the corn mandate, would make America's energy policy resemble California's, where gas prices are far and away the highest in the nation.\Americans may wish we had California's sunshine, but we don't need their high gas prices. The only acceptable solution is to repeal the mandate entirely. U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., has already introduced legislation that would do just that. Utahns should encourage their Members of Congress to join him in passing it without delay.\Meanwhile, instead of focusing on how to get votes in just one state, presidential candidates should focus on what's good for the whole country. With the primaries and caucuses still nine months away, there's plenty of time to make sure the RFS gets the national attention it deserves. Opposing it should be an easy decision for principled candidates who side with American families over special interests.\Charles Drevna is a distinguished senior fellow at the American Energy Alliance, a non-profit advocacy group funded by oil and gas interests.\Credit: By Charles Drevna"

WASHINGTON -- Defying a presidential veto threat, the Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a highway spending bill that would bring jobs and billions of dollars in new construction money to states across the country.
\
The Republican-controlled Senate voted 76-21 to pass a six-year, $318 billion highway and mass transit spending bill, replacing the current six-year program that expires at the end of this month. The vote margin would be enough to override a possible presidential veto.
\
""Everybody agrees we need to put much more money into road, highways, bridges and mass transit,"" said Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo.
\
But the $318 billion sought far outstrips the $218 billion approved for the current six-year plan and the $256 billion the administration insists should be the ceiling at a time when the government faces record-high budget deficits. The House has yet to act on its bill. Some House members say the Senate total is too low to fix the nation's crumbling highways.
\
The administration says it would recommend that Bush use his veto authority for the first time in his presidency if the final bill is at the Senate spending level.
\
""This is the first test for the Congress when it comes to spending restraint,"" White House press secretary Scott McClellan said Thursday. ""We urge Congress to hold the line on spending.""
\
But Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said conservative estimates are that the bill will create 1.6 million jobs over its lifetime. It is politically important to many lawmakers eager to direct federal spending to their states and districts.
\
Showing their willingness to take on the president, senators voted 78-20 to defeat an amendment by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., to reduce the funding to the president's $256 billion figure.
\
Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said that even as a fiscal conservative he believed in spending more in certain areas such as national defense and infrastructure. ""I know that's what we are supposed to be doing here.""
\
With Democrats generally supporting the bill, the fight was mainly among Republicans.
\
""The party of fiscal sanity, the party of smaller government,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is supporting a bill ""when the president of the United States and the American people are saying enough, enough deficit spending.""
\
At a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Treasury Secretary John Snow characterized the highway bill as a litmus test for the government's will to cut the deficit. A bill that exceeds the president's request, he said, ""would have a very, very very corrosive effect in financial market confidence in all of us.""
\
Senate supporters denied that it increased the deficit, saying all the money comes out of the highway trust fund paid for by the 18.4-cent federal tax that drivers pay at the gas pump. The Senate Finance Committee outlined several budgetary actions, some questioned by critics of the bill, to increase the flow of money into the trust fund.
\
In a key vote Thursday, the Senate defeated, by 72-24, an attempt by McCain to declare the bill out of order because it exceeded previously set budget limits.
\
Earlier, the Senate voted 86-11 to end a filibuster from conservatives who agreed with the administration that the deficit- ridden government can't afford the highway bill. Both the budget and filibuster votes needed 60-vote majorities.
\
Backers of full funding said 35 percent of the 42,000 people killed annually in vehicle crashes die because of road conditions. They also said congestion costs the average peak-hour driver $1,160 a year and the nation $67 billion in wasted fuel and lost productivity.
\
Bill sponsors also turned back a rebellion from senators who claimed that their states lose out under a formula that guarantees that by 2009 every state will get at least 95 cents back for every dollar it contributes to the trust fund.
\
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, sought to shift $9 billion in unallocated funds in the bill to help rapid-growth states such as Texas, California and Florida with pressing infrastructure needs. Her amendment was defeated, 78-17.
\
With little hope of getting a bill soon, the House voted Wednesday to extend the existing highway program for four months, through the end of June. The current program ended last September, but was temporarily extended through the end of this month.
\
The House Transportation Committee is seeking even more money, $375 billion, and has proposed raising the gasoline tax, an idea strongly opposed by the White House and House GOP leaders.
\
But one Senate conservative, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said that ""probably over time conservatives are going to have to come to grips with the idea that a gas tax increase is going to be the only legitimate way, and honest way, to make up the shortfalls in terms of highway needs.""
"
218," As the April 15 tax deadline edges closer, taxpayers frantically completing their 1040s may be wondering just what their hard-earned federal tax dollars pay for, anyway.\ Washington will spend $23,760 per household in 2006 - the highest inflation-adjusted total since World War II, and $6,500 more than in 2001. The federal government will collect $20,044 per household in taxes. The remaining $3,716 represents this year's budget deficit per household, which, along with all prior government debt, will be dumped in the laps of our children.\ Here's a breakdown of how Washington will spend that $23,760 per household:\ Social Security/Medicare: $7,875. The 15.3 percent payroll tax, split evenly between the employer and employee, covers most of these costs. This system can remain sustainable only if there are enough workers to support all retirees, which is why it risks collapsing under the weight of 77 million retiring baby boomers. If nothing is done, taxes eventually will need to be raised by the current equivalent of $11,000 per household to pay all promised benefits. The unpredictable costs of the new Medicare drug entitlement could add thousands more to each household's tax bill.\ Defense: $4,701. The defense budget covers everything from military salaries to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to the research, development and acquisition of new technologies. Lawmakers drastically reduced defense spending following the collapse of communism in the early 1990s. The 9/11 attacks reversed this trend, and the $1,900 per household increase since 2001 has returned defense spending to its historical levels.\ Low-income programs: $3,579. Nearly half of this spending subsidizes state Medicaid programs that provide health services to poor families. Other low-income spending includes: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps, housing subsidies, child- care subsidies, Supplemental Security Income and low-income tax credits. Despite recent rhetoric about ""cuts for poor,"" anti- poverty spending now tops 3 percent of GDP for the first time ever.\ Interest on the federal debt: $1,930. The federal government is $8.2 trillion in debt. It owes $4.9 trillion to public bond owners, and the rest to other federal agencies (mostly to repay the Social Security trust fund, which lawmakers raid annually). Despite rising debt, record-low interest rates have limited costs. As interest rates rise back to normal levels, these costs will spike.\ Federal employee retirement benefits: $870. This spending funds the retirement and disability benefits of federal employees, including the military.\ Education: $732. Education spending is primarily a state and local function; 9 percent of the total comes from Washington. Federal education spending has surged 137 percent since the 2001 enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act. Most federal dollars are spent on low-income school districts, special education and college student financial aid.\ Health research/regulation: $671. This spending is up 78 percent since 2001, and much of this growth is concentrated in the National Institute of Health. This category includes the Food and Drug Administration and dozens of grant programs for health providers.\ Veterans' benefits: $618. The federal government provides income and health benefits to war veterans. Spending is up 56 percent since 2001.\ Community and regional development: $456. The $300 per household leap in this category since 2004 comes from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is financing much of the Hurricane Katrina relief.\ Highways/mass transit: $402. Most highway and mass-transit spending is financed by the 18.4 cent per-gallon federal gas tax. Washington subtracts an administrative cost and sends this money back to the states with numerous strings attached. Some economists suggest it would be more efficient to let states collect this tax and decide how to spend the money themselves.\ Justice administration: $363. Justice spending includes federal attorneys and prisons, as well as law-enforcement grant programs. New homeland security costs have added $80 per household to justice spending.\ Unemployment benefits: $338. Unemployment costs fluctuate based on the number of unemployed Americans. This year, unemployment costs are decreasing as job growth continues.\ International affairs: $305. This includes foreign economic and military assistance, operation of American embassies abroad, and contributions to organizations such as the United Nations. International spending has doubled since 9/11.\ Natural resources/environment: $287. This includes national parks, federal lands, water projects and environmental clean-up.\ Agriculture: $235. Despite rhetoric about supporting small family farms, the vast majority of farm subsidies are distributed to large farms with average household incomes over $135,000.\ The programs listed above cover $23,362 per household. The remaining $398 is allocated to all other federal programs, including social services, space exploration, air transportation and energy.\ Taxpayers must decide for themselves if they're getting their money's worth.\ Brian Riedl is the Grover M.

219,"Gov. Gary Herbert is promising no new taxes, no new debt and an increase in spending per-pupil when he unveils a $13 billion-plus state budget proposal early next month.\State and legislative economists are forecasting $338 million in new tax revenue will be collected in the coming budget year, a welcome departure from the not-too-distant past, when the Great Recession resulted in shrinking budgets and belt-tightening across government.\But don't expect that money to stretch too far, cautions Kristen Cox, director of the Governor's Office of Management and Budget.\Educating a projected 10,300 new public-school students, managing the growing prison population, maintaining state buildings, meeting growing Medicaid demands and paying state workers will put serious demands on state dollars, Cox told reporters Monday.\Cox said Herbert will propose spending the $60 million needed to educate the new students and will likely seek an increase in the state's per-pupil spending, which remains the lowest in the nation.\House Speaker Becky Lockhart expects paying for the education growth will again be a top priority, as it is every year.\""That's one of the things we look at very first,"" she said. ""We'll be looking at that right away.""\Beyond education, however, there could be a competition for dollars.\""There are always a lot more [requests] than there is money,"" said Senate President Wayne Niederhauser. ""At the end of the day, we have to balance all that out and we have to proceed cautiously, as we do and have done in times past.""\The governor will not seek to incur any more debt -- through the issuance of state bonds -- to build roads or buildings, even though some lawmakers have already approached the office with building wish-lists.\""There is a time and place where bonding makes sense, but we are very clear that we don't think that this year is the time for bonding to occur,"" Cox said. ""We need to demonstrate fiscal discipline.""\Lockhart and Niederhauser agree with that strategy.\""What I anticipate is there is going to be some significant resistance in the House to any kind of bonding,"" Lockhart said, based on discussions with Republican House leaders and members of the GOP caucus.\The state has $3.4 billion in outstanding debt, largely the result of hundreds of millions in bonds issued to pay to rebuild Interstate 15 through Utah County. As a result, each Utahn has roughly $1,200 in state debt, double what the figure has traditionally been. Moreover, the state is paying $430 million a year in interest on the outstanding bonds.\Herbert will not propose any new taxes in his budget. That includes no increase in the gas tax, a proposal that has been batted around by the Legislature for the past several years.\""I think it's highly unlikely it will be considered this year,"" Cox said.\Juliette Tennert, chief economist with the governor's budget office, said uncertainty at the national level -- including sequestration, the federal government shutdown, and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act -- are thwarting growth in the state. However, the projected 3.8 percent growth rate, while down from the rate this year, is on par with the state's historic growth curve, she said.\Lockhart said lagging sales tax revenue is a signal that growth isn't as strong as leaders would like.\Niederhauser said the overall economic growth shows Utah leaders are doing things right.\""It's the economy that generates the tax revenues so it is pleasing to me and I think to most in the Legislature we are creating at least an environment that is generating some growth in revenue,"" he said. ""So I think we are doing some things right.""\Medicaid continues to be a growing share of the state budget, now consuming 22 percent of state revenue with the possibility of swelling to 30 percent. Today, 12 percent of Utahns are on Medicaid, compared to 6 percent in years past.\Medicaid changes mandated by the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare, will cost the state an extra $5 million in the coming year, Tennert said.\That is without the proposed expansion of Medicaid to cover about 123,000 Utahns who make up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The governor has promised to work with legislators to decide whether to expand the program -- which, in the initial years, would be paid for by the federal government.\Herbert will not make a recommendation on expansion in his budget, although Herbert has said he doesn't expect it would have a major impact on the budget either way.\Of the $338 million in anticipated new state money flowing to the state, $132 million will be available only once, meaning it can be used to build buildings or roads or buy equipment, but lawmakers can't count on it to pay salaries or other recurring costs.\gehrke@sltrib.com\Twitter: @RobertGehrke\Credit: By Robert Gehrke The Salt Lake Tribune"

The April 15 tax deadline provides taxpayers the opportunity to examine how their elected officials will spend their hard-earned tax dollars.
\
Washington will spend $22,039 per household in 2005 -- the highest inflation-adjusted total since World War II, and $4,000 more than in 2001. The federal government will collect $18,248 per household in taxes. The remaining $3,791 represents the budget deficit per household, which, along with all prior government debt, will be dumped in the laps of our children.

Social Security/Medicare: $7,245. The 15.3 percent payroll tax, split evenly between the employer and employee, covers most of these costs. This system can remain sustainable only if there are enough workers to support all retirees, which is why it risks collapsing under the weight of 77 million retiring baby boomers. If nothing is done, taxes will need to be raised by the current equivalent of $5,200 per household by 2030 and $13,500 per household in 2050 to pay all promised benefits. The unpredictable costs of the new Medicare drug entitlement could add thousands more to each household's tax bill.

\
Low-income programs: $3,559. Nearly half of this spending subsidizes state Medicaid programs that provide health services to poor families. In line with economywide health-care trends, Medicaid costs are rising 9 percent per year. Other low-income spending includes: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), food stamps, housing subsidies, child-care subsidies, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and low-income tax credits.
\
Interest on the federal debt: $1,582. The federal government is $8 trillion in debt. It owes $4.7 trillion to public bond owners, and the rest to other federal agencies (mostly to repay the Social Security trust fund, which lawmakers raid annually). Record low interest rates have reduced the interest payments by $1,000 per household since 1998. As interest rates rise back to normal levels, so will these costs to taxpayers.

"
221," WASHINGTON -- How, one may ask, does it happen that a man who is unknown to most Americans, one of 100 senators and a freshman at that, can dictate energy policy and much of fiscal policy as well to the entire nation?\ The short answer is that President Clinton, desperate for votes for his budget, cannot afford to lose any more of the 49 Democrats who supported it in the earlier round of voting, when Vice President Gore cast the tie-breaking vote to keep it alive. So when Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, one of the 49, announced that he would accept no gas tax hike higher than 4.3 cents a gallon, it didn't matter what Clinton or the rest of Congress thought. That was it.\ Thus, an ambitious plan to reduce dependence on foreign oil, improve the efficiency of energy use and help clean up the environment went down the drain --and a $49 billion hole was ripped in Clinton's budget, forcing higher taxes on a few and deeper program cuts for many.\ Kohl was far from alone in using the leverage the situation offered him to impose his personal policy and political agenda on the nation. Other senators also set a policy price for their votes. Kohl's press secretary says the senator just wanted to ""draw the line"" on middle-class taxes, and his stand is popular with voters in Wisconsin, where he faces re-election next year. But it is a striking example of how the legacy of Roger Sherman has come, in our time, to make the United States Senate a body that defies contemporary understanding of democracy.\ Sherman was the delegate to the Constitutional Convention who in 1787 devised the ""Connecticut Compromise."" It made membership in the House of Representatives proportional to population but decreed that each state, regardless of size, would have two senators. It was a brilliant piece of statecraft, which ended a bitter big state vs. small state battle and sent the Constitution on to ratification.\ Through more than two centuries, the principle of federalism embodied in Sherman's plan, in Article IV and in the 10th Amendment, has served this country superbly well, enabling us to achieve flexibility in our system without disunity. But like everything else in politics, it comes with a price -- and Kohl's power play last week dramatizes that price.\ With very little notice, the Senate has become increasingly unrepresentative of the United States. As population has concentrated in 100 or so major metropolitan areas and a dozen megastates, the disparity between the House and Senate has grown. In this Congress, a majority of senators -- actually 54 of 100 -- come from states that collectively elect only 87 representatives, one-fifth of the members of the House. That is the major reason why measures like the energy tax can command majorities in the House but be killed in the Senate.\ While large- and medium-sized states like Texas, Illinois, Michigan, Washington, Missouri and Georgia provide the leaders of the two parties in the House, their counterparts in the Senate come from smaller states like Maine, Kansas, Kentucky, Wyoming, West Virginia and Mississippi.\ All this may simply reflect the modern application of Sherman's famous compromise. But there are other changes inside the Senate which were not contemplated by the Founders -- changes which make it even less representative than it might otherwise be.\ For one thing, it has become a haven for the wealthy. No fewer than 27 of the hundred senators, including Kohl, are millionaires, according to a compilation of their financial disclosure forms by the Capitol Hill newspaper, Roll Call. Only seven of the hundred are women. Only one is an African-American. Latinos are totally absent. Economically and sociologically, this is an elite group -- whose members can easily afford to defy presidents, parties or even public opinion.\ Just as important is the political independence of today's senators. Originally, senators were elected by state legislatures, which meant their tenure depended on staying on good terms with their counterparts back home. When the popular election of senators began 80 years ago, political parties were still strong enough to exert some real influence on the selection of Senate nominees.\ But nowadays, senators mount their own campaigns and essentially operate as individual political entrepreneurs, not to say prima donnas. One indication of this trend can be found in the fact that one-fifth of today's senators held no elective office of any kind before coming to the Senate.\ Like Herb Kohl, they simply saw the Senate as a place where they could make a mark -- and they went for it. Kohl financed his election in 1988 with $7.5 million of his own money, wiping out his primary- and general-election opponents with the most expensive campaign Wisconsin had ever seen. Still, his Senate seat cost him substantially less than the $18.5 million he spent on his basketball team, the Milwaukee Bucks.\ This is not a plea for abolishing the Senate -- or neutering it, like the House of Lords. It remains a great theater for politics, comedy and occasional drama. But when a single senator, operating solely by his personal compass, can set policy for the whole country, the great design of the Constitution has gone awry."

223,"America urgently needs a ""green revolution,"" and it won't be painless, columnist and author Thomas Friedman told a sold-out crowd at Salt Lake City's Abravanel Hall on Tuesday night.\It needs to pioneer affordable clean energy not just to save the environment, the New York Times commentator said, but also to keep its competitive edge and to promote freedom around the world.\His prescription, in two words, to jump-start such a revolution: carbon tax.\""Price matters,"" Friedman told about 3,000 people at his keynote address in the Utah Museum of Natural History's 2009 ""Nature of Things"" lecture series. Last summer Toyota hybrids were in short supply, but now that gasoline prices have fallen, it's hard to sell one. The way to spur energy innovation by entrepreneurs in ""10,000 garages,"" Friedman said, is to make fossil fuels cost more.\If that means oil companies or American automakers as currently configured suffer, he said, then that's what must happen. Right now, those companies simply talk about being green, he said.\""Have you ever been to a revolution where nobody got hurt? Oh, that's the green revolution we're having,"" Friedman said. ""That's not a revolution, friends, that's a party.""\Addressing the theme of his new best-seller, Hot, Flat, and Crowded , the author said clean energy is in all the world's interest but will most reward the country that pioneers it. The booming global population will need energy to avoid poverty and, without a green revolution, that energy will foul the Earth on a calamitous scale.\Tackling the problem matters not just to the climate or to the rapid extinction of Earth's species, he said, but to freedom around the world. Friedman charted oil prices in recent decades and matched it against the rise and fall of freedom in petroleum-funded nations, or ""petrodictatorships,"" as measured by social scientists. The result is heightened freedom when oil is cheap, he said. For instance, Iranians elected a reformer at $16 a barrel and then a Holocaust denier at $75 a barrel.\If America does pay the real costs of carbon -- with a tax that considers everything from pollution to soldiers in Iraq -- it can scale up new energy technologies to the point at which they will be cheap enough to feed the population boom's energy hunger, Friedman said. He likened the process to the premium that Americans paid for the first cell phones, which in turn helped increase production until the prices fell.\His message resonated with the crowd, and many lined up for book signings afterward. Park City resident Jolene Aubel said she grew up in a Midwestern family with General Motors Corp. workers, but now wants a Toyota hybrid and would accept a carbon tax on her gas.\""It's something that's really important for people to hear right now,"" Aubel said. The fact that 3,000 Utahns bought tickets to hear it shows Americans are starting to take note.\bloomis@sltrib.com\Friedman on other topics\What Thomas Friedman told Utah reporters or Utah Museum of Natural History benefactors after a Tuesday luncheon:\On climate-change skeptics are science deniers - ""That's not conservative.

226,"
WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Tuesday approved a six-year, $295 billion highway and transit bill that renewed a veto threat from the White House but raised the hopes of funds-strapped transit officials in Utah.
\
The state stands to receive $282 million in federal funding under the Senate bill -- an increase of $13 million over the already approved House version that President Bush says comes with too high a price tag.
\
Republicans joined Democrats in saying the need for highway money was so great they were willing to risk a veto.
\
In more than two weeks of debate, senators repeated the same points: One-third of major roads are in poor or mediocre condition; 29 percent of bridges are structurally deficient; and 36 percent of urban rail vehicles are in substandard or poor condition. One-third of the 42,000 traffic fatalities every year result in part from poor road conditions.
\
""This bill will make a difference in the life of every American by making it easier and safer to move from place to place,"" Sen. James Jeffords, I-Vt., who leads the minority on the Environment and Public Works Committee, said in urging the White House to withdraw its veto threat.
\
The Senate vote was 89-11, with 46 of the chamber's 55 Republicans -- including Utahns Orrin Hatch and Bob Bennett -- joining Democrats in voting for the measure despite the White House admonitions.
\
White House press secretary Scott McClellan had said that President Bush was ""very serious"" about fiscal responsibility and would be urged to veto any bill that exceeded $284 billion, the amount approved by the House in March.
\
If not vetoed by the president, that money could give Utah a ""reliable outlook"" for what road projects could be funded in the future, said Tom Hudachko, Utah Department of Transportation spokesman.
\
Utah is facing a $23 billion deficit for road and transit projects planned over the next 25 years. Last year, according to a statement from Hatch's office, Utah received $254 million in federal highway funding -- and it wasn't enough to increase capacity or maintain current roads.
\
""I think the biggest thing it does is it gives us some reliability long-term,"" Hudachko said. ""These construction projects aren't like a water faucet where you can turn them off and on at a day's notice. They take years of planning for and unless you've got a long-term funding commitment, its impossible to get through the process.""
\
Several long-term Utah road projects have been earmarked for funding, including new I-15 interchanges in Ogden, Layton and Provo and construction of the Northern Corridor in St. George.
\
The Utah Transit Authority may also receive funding for several projects: commuter rail from Ogden to Provo, light rail to the airport and South Jordan and for construction of the 9400 South TRAX station.
\
If the bill is passed, it could provide complete funding for the Weber to Salt Lake City portion of commuter rail.
\
""It's not guaranteed, but it gives us a license to hunt,"" said UTA spokesman Justin Jones. ""It puts us in a position to compete with other transit agencies for the funding. It's a good step, we like being in this position, but on the other hand, it's not a guarantee for money.""
\
The Senate now must work out its differences with the House- passed bill, which in addition to approving less money specifies thousands of specific projects requested by lawmakers, from bike paths to sidewalks to parking lots. Almost all of the Senate money is divided among the states by a complicated formula.
\
Senators said they had found new revenue sources, such as eliminating tax abuses, that would allow them to add $11 billion to the House bill without adding to the federal deficit. The White House discounted the Senate steps as accounting gimmicks.
\
In addition to granting money to states to repair and build roads and bridges, the bill provides more than $50 billion for public transit, funds recreational road programs and promotes highway safety.
\
The Senate vote was in some ways a repeat of last year, when the senators approved a bill well above what the White House deemed affordable. In the end no compromise was reached with Congress, and lawmakers have had to pass six temporary extensions of the old six- year act, which expired on Sept. 30, 2003.
\
With 20 months gone since the last highway bill, there is growing pressure to come up with a compromise. The latest extension runs out on May 31.
\
The legislation funds many relatively small programs -- bike routes to schools, covered bridges, ferry terminals -- as well as programs to promote fuel-efficient vehicles and authorize tolls to finance new interstate lanes.
\
Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., won approval of an amendment that would require the Environmental Protection Agency to update fuel economy testing to reflect real-life driving conditions. Gas mileage stickers on new cars now inflate true fuel economy performance by 10 percent to 30 percent.
\
The Senate also confirmed, in a vote Tuesday, a provision that would increase grants for safety programs to states that allow police to stop motorists who don't wear seat belts even when there is no other traffic violation.
\
The House bill, unlike the Senate version, includes some 4,000 specific projects, worth some $12 billion, that were requested by lawmakers for their districts.
\
These projects, cited by fiscal conservatives as ""pork,"" will be one sticking point as House and Senate negotiators try to work out a compromise.
\
Another difference that must be resolved is the formula by which the federal government divides up money from the highway trust fund for the states. The trust fund comes from the 18.4 cents a gallon federal gas tax, and about half the states, mainly from fast- growing or heavily traveled areas, complain that they pay more into the fund than they get back from Washington.
\
Two Wisconsin Democrats, Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold, voted against the bill. They were joined by Republicans Sam Brownback of Kansas, John Cornyn and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, Jim DeMint and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Jon Kyl and John McCain of Arizona and Judd Gregg and John Sununu of New Hampshire.

227,"Utah lawmakers are exploring major changes in tax policy, in part to provide more money for education. These deliberations are taking place under the threat of an initiative petition drive by Our Schools Now (OSN) to ask voters to increase income taxes.\Legislative leadership is hoping to change Utah's tax structure by reducing tax rates while broadening the tax base to more people and entities. Will this provide additional funding for education and push back against OSN?\Pignanelli: ""A tax loophole is something that benefits the other guy. If it benefits you, it is tax reform."" - Russell B. Long\Attending a family reunion of in-laws can be drudgery but necessary to promote household harmony. But the activity must be navigated with sensitivity and caution. There are risks everywhere. The potential of making enemies (i.e. too little attention paid to a relative) must be minimized to avoid long-term suffering. Similar perilous adventures plague tax reform actions.\The threat of OSN, combined with shrinking general fund sources, is compelling lawmakers into a comparable environment. They are delicately examining changes, which may incur animosity (sales tax back on food and restructuring the gas tax). Yet, the legislators are using this situation as an opportunity to reconfigure taxes for Utah to remain competitive. \Because of controversy, modifications to income taxes are likely to remain in discussion stages. Revamping sales taxes is probable, resulting in winners and losers. Advocacy groups from both categories - especially the latter - will be inundating the Capitol.\As with spending time with in-laws, any effort breeds goodwill. The Legislature can respond to OSN supporters that good faith actions are developing for comprehensive improvement. OSN supporters will be dissatisfied since anticipated reform does not generate enough immediate revenue for their concerns. Such sentiments reflect most family dynamics, whatever good one has performed is never enough.\Webb: It absolutely makes sense to broaden the tax base. Low rates spread over a broad base is the best and most sustainable tax policy. It was a major mistake to eliminate the sales tax on food. It should be restored and taxes due on online sales should certainly be collected. Tax credits, loopholes, exemptions and subsidies should be reviewed to broaden the tax base. The economy has changed, and tax policy must change with it.\But part of the tax reform goal must be to raise more money for education - now. Not just sometime in the future. If the Legislature doesn't make real progress this session, the OSN group should move forward aggressively to gather signatures and place a proposal on the ballot so the people can decide.\Is Utah's education funding crisis serious enough to require a significant tax increase and does the political will exist to raise taxes?\Pignanelli: Our astute state constitution authors mandated income tax receipts into the Uniform School Fund. This ensures a dedicated revenue source for Utah students. But the downside is the impossibility for politicians to increase income taxes. These payments are personal to taxpayers.\Utah's bigger share of families with children calculates into fewer dollars per student. So there is always a legitimate need and demand for more resources. But increasing income taxes is a political nightmare. Gov. Norman Bangerter almost lost re-election after pushing a temporary bump to address a public education crisis. Every politico know this.\Webb: The most basic and important component of Utah's public education system is absolutely in crisis - the ability to attract and retain top-quality teachers by paying them a living wage. That crisis, alone, requires a major funding boost.\We have more children, on a percentage basis, than any state in the nation. We simply can't educate them on the cheap. Nothing is more important to Utah's economy and its future success than excellent education that prepares our young people for good jobs.\Utah employers already can't find enough skilled workers in many fields. Employers won't come to Utah or expand in Utah if we have extremely low taxes but don't have qualified workers.\Note that OSN is led by hard-headed business leaders, not by traditional education advocates.\Should Utah aspire to become the top education state in the nation and is it even possible?\Pignanelli: Utah is consistently honored for how we conduct business, manage public funds and interact with each other. So we should focus the ""Utah Way"" on specific objectives.\Webb: If we really care about our children, if we are a family-focused state, we absolutely ought to aspire to be No. 1. Our young people can be our greatest asset or our greatest liability.\Massachusetts is arguably the top education state in the nation. Utah is pretty average. So what's the difference? Are Utah schoolchildren dumber than those in Massachusetts? Are our parents less caring? Are our teachers less capable?\No. Here's the difference: Massachusetts provides top-notch education because it spends $14,515 per pupil. Utah spends $6,555. Wow. What a contrast. Certainly, money isn't everything. But money can hire great teachers, can provide early education, can provide excellent career guidance, can bring extra resources to struggling students.\I believe that Utah, with our family focus, strong demographics and collaborative spirit could become the nation's No. 1 education state.\But we will never get there if we spend less per pupil than any state in the nation.\Republican LaVarr Webb is a political consultant and lobbyist.

228,"
Pignanelli: Best Politician : Salt Lake County Mayor Nancy Workman. She gave enormous raises to her staff, increased county government and was still honored by the Utah Taxpayers Association. Although it is painful to endure the mayor's speeches, she has tenacity and guile.
\
Worst Veteran Mistake: In protesting a salary increase for Workman's assistant, Salt Lake County District Attorney David Yocom disparaged this woman's position by dismissing her as ""hairdresser"" to the mayor. You have to admire his efficiency of language -- with just one word he insulted thousands of women and hairstylists.
\
Best Democrat Rising Star: Rep. Pat Jones. This second-term legislator sponsored legislation to limit tax deductions for large families. Some question her sanity for pursuing such political suicide in Utah, but lawmakers and Gov. Olene Walker are following her lead in exploring new alternatives for education funding.
\
Best Republican Rising Star: Sen. James Evans. His election to the Senate from the west side of Salt Lake was considered to be a bizarre one-time fluke. By withholding state funds until Mayor Rocky Anderson agreed to pay attention to northwest Salt Lake City with economic development and neighborhood improvements, Evans has energized his community.
\
Best News for Utah Democrats: Scott Matheson Jr. will be a candidate for governor in 2004. He can sleepwalk through the election and still receive 40 percent of the vote.
\
Worst Reason to Move to Washington, D.C.: To be EPA director, which is like the local sewer commissioner -- most people do not know who he/she is until there is a horrible, disgusting problem. Can Mike Leavitt transform this sow's ear into silk?
\
Best Kept Secret: Orrin Hatch has actually written songs that were performed in major motion pictures and by major artists. It's a shame he didn't sing them during the recent U.S. Senate filibuster.
\
Worst Rookie Mistake: Most freshmen members of Congress use their maiden legislative opportunity to promote heartwarming activities like ""Family Week"" or safety in schools. Such delicacies are not for Rep. Rob Bishop. He would rather take a strong stand in favor of more radioactive waste coming to Utah.
\
Best Reason to Admit a Mistake: Many Democrats (including me) thought that after 11 years of holding Mike Leavitt's briefcase, Olene Walker lacked the spine to chart an independent course. When we are wrong, we are really wrong.
\
Best Reason It is Better to be Lucky Than Good: Tom Welch and Dave Johnson's list of witnesses they were going to call at trial to prove that prominent Utahns knew of their activities.
\
In Memoriam: Sen. John Holmgren (Box Elder) came to the Legislature as a conservative Republican focused on reducing government. As chairman of the Human Services Committee, John metamorphosed into a vocal advocate for the poor in our state. Julia Nielson, wife of Congressman Howard Nielson (former House speaker and state senator), was a source of strength for him in the corridors of power. Both will be missed.
\
Webb: Best Political Cause With Prospects For a Win: The school choice movement in Utah. After a slow and difficult start, the movement is gaining steam and attracting support from numerous politicians, including most gubernatorial candidates. Sorry UEA, it's only a matter of time.
\
Best Media Move: Deseret News, to morning publication. Positions the paper for the future.
\
Second Best Media Move: KUTV to Main Street. Sure it's a gimmick, but it works. Makes the Channel 2 bunch seem more a part of the community.
\
Best Comeback: Tom Welch and Dave Johnson, now able to move on with their lives.
\
Second Best Comeback: Salt Lake Tribune, which endured a tumultuous year with the firing of two reporters over a National Enquirer scandal and the resignation of its editor. Publisher William Dean Singleton handled the crisis adroitly. The paper seems to have bounced back, is looking good, and appears none the worse for wear.
\
Best Political Move: Mike Leavitt to EPA. He had served plenty long as governor and will now ply his considerable political skills at a new and much different level. After a lot of silly posturing by environmental groups, he won confirmation by landslide votes. In his first speech to the EPA staff he promoted his Enlibra philosophy of environmental management and won a standing ovation. Enlibra lives! Will his luck hold? Who knows, but he's not going to get chewed up and spit out as some predicted. His next challenge is performing well on the campaign trail for Bush. Leavitt may have a fair amount of inside knowledge about Howard Dean, the apparent Democratic nominee, having served closely with Dean in leadership positions in the National Governors Association.
\
Best Misunderstood Company: Envirocare of Utah. The firm's 400 employees perform an important public service. They clean up the environment rather than pollute it. They safely dispose of waste rather than create it. But environmental activists and some in the news media need a whipping boy, and Envirocare is handy. Driving down the freeway for 15 minutes is more dangerous than working 30 years at the Envirocare site.
\
Most Gutsy Stand: Wasatch Front local leaders for proposing sales tax and gas tax hikes for light rail, commuter rail and highways. Some legislators are saying No Way, but the alternative is gridlock. Let the people choose if they want better mobility and more Traxx lines.
\
Freshest Breath of Air: Olene Walker: She's going after what she believes in, without regard to politics, even though she may not get much of it.
\
Best Year: Smart family. With all the tumult and publicity, one thing is certain: Elizabeth is back. A family can't have a better year than that.
\
Biggest Political Upset: Donald Dunn's defeat of Meghan Holbrook for Democratic state chairman.

229," Scott M. Matheson, 61, who rose from a little-known railroad attorney to become Utah's 12th governor in 1976, died Sunday of multiple myeloma, a cancer in the blood-forming system of the bone marrow.\ University of Utah Health Sciences Center spokesman John Dwan said the former two-term governor died at 5 a.m.\ The disease was first diagnosed last December, but last winter it went into remission and the prognosis turned optimistic. The disease flared up again in June and rapidly worsened during the past month.\ Gov. Matheson, a Democrat, managed the state during a time that saw rapid industrial and population growth. As governor, he stressed the need for a partnership between the state and federal government to develop energy resources and minimize the impact on local communities and environments.\ He battled the federal government to keep water projects like the Central Utah Project going, and he battled for cancer victims of the Nevada nuclear fallout.\ The governor also fought the federal government over the MX missile, the Intermountain Power Project and shipment of the 888 Weteye nerve gas shipments to Utah. He dropped welfare rolls to the lowest level in a decade, sought more property tax relief for the elderly poor and inaugurated a state building program.\ Gov. Matheson, born Jan. 8, 1929, was raised in Cedar City and Salt Lake City and was the son of the late U.S. attorney Scott M. Matheson Sr.\ The Stanford University Law School graduate joined his father's Cedar City law practice in 1952. During his years there, he was elected Parowan city attorney and became a deputy attorney for Iron County. He also was a deputy Salt Lake County attorney.\ In 1954 he became a legal clerk under Judge Willis W. Ritter, where he received much of his valuable law experience, he once told The Tribune.\ Gov. Matheson had always been active in Democratic Party affairs, and was president of the Utah Young Democrats in 1948. He was named the statewide manager for the 1956 campaign for Democratic candidates and was chairman of numerous fund-raising events for the party.\ In 1962, he was elected president of the Junior Bar section of the Utah State Bar. He was elected president of the Utah State Bar in 1969.\ In 1970 he was appointed assistant general counsel of Anaconda Co., a copper mine company, in Salt Lake City. He had directed the company's legal staff since joining the firm in August 1969.\ Gov. Matheson ran for his first major political office when he entered the gubernatorial race of 1976. At the time of his announcement, he was general solicitor for the Union Pacific Railroad. He later gave up this position to donate more time to his campaign.\ His opponent for the Democratic nomination was John Preston Creer, a former Salt Lake County commissioner.\ Campaigning on the slogan ""a citizen's candidate,"" he called for a policy statement on intergovernmental relations for the establishment of a ""community impact fund"" to finance public services needed because of mineral development. He also urged an end to age discrimination and manadatory retirement, favored specialized placement programs and advocated a space-available free auditing program for the elderly in college classes.\ His biggest campign boost came when he received the backing of ex-Gov. Calvin L. Rampton, who had just finished three terms in 1976. Gov. Matheson had also received the backing of Democrat Jimmy Carter, the party's presidential candidate who was elected the same year Gov. Matheson won the gubernatorial election.\ Gov. Matheson easily beat Mr. Creer for the Democratic governor nomination and then beat two-term Republican Attorney General Vernon B. Romney for the governorship.\ In his first proposed state budget, he recommended lowering the inheritance tax and providing tax relief through a ""circuit breaker"" concept that would permit a credit off income tax for low-income elderly, and wanted to increase the gas tax. He also suggested using a $5.1 million surplus in the state's budget to fight an impending summer drought.\ During 1977, he created an Office of Minority Business Enterprise within the Division of Industrial Promotion, attended an energy conference in Washington, D.C., with President Carter, approved the 55-mph speed limit, and pushed for the Central Utah Project. He also went to Alaska to form the Western Governors Policy Office.\ In 1978, Gov. Matheson and the state entered national headlines. First came the Department of Defense's proposed transfer of 888 Weteye nerve gas bombs to Tooele. The first-term governor vehemently opposed the transfer for health and safety reasons. Three of the bombs were leaking the deadly nerve agent.\ Gov. Matheson organized a committee to research results of the 1950s Nevada nuclear tests and fallout, and the correlation with cancer. He later took the nuclear fallout issue to Washington, D.C., and worked for a federal grant for the University of Utah to study the link between the nuclear fallout and cancer.\ Locally, he supported the city-county government unification and proposed a three-phase program to help welfare recipients through the state's Job Service office.\ Gov. Matheson also wanted the Legislature to provide $40 million in property tax relief along a $50 ""homestead credit"" to all homeowners; another $10 million extra in state aid to local school districts; and an additional $20 million to expand the ""circuit breaker"" partial property tax rebates going to lower income homeowners and renters, making the relief available to all.\ He opposed establishment of the Division of Corrections as a separate department, and opposed combining juvenile and adult corrections.\ During 1978 he received the Minuteman Award from the Utah National Guard, was named chairman of the National Governors Association's Task Force on American Indian Policy and was chosen vice chairman of the Western Governors Policy Office. Gov. Matheson was also re-elected to the board of directors of the American Judicature Society and served on the Blue Ribbon Task Force of the Utah Judicial Conference.\ In 1979, Gov. Matheson continued to battle the federal government over the Weteye bombs. In June he sought a restraining order from Chief Judge Aldon J. Anderson, U.S. District Court for Utah, to thwart the Army's transfer of the Weteye bombs.\ It was also the year Gov. Matheson organized a staff to research the proposed MX missile sites in Utah. Gov. Matheson at first supported the MX system ""in the interests of national security"" but later became skeptical of the Defense Department's plans for the system.\ He first criticized the Air Force's draft legislation for land use in connection with the MX missile system. Gov. Matheson opposed the Air Force's authority to segregate as much as 7,000 square miles of public land in Utah and Nevada for possible missile use. He also opposed the secretary of defense's discretion in seeking only in-depth evaluations of isolated land sites while superficially measuring environmental and social impacts over a larger area.\ As the MX missile debate continued through the year, Gov. Matheson found fault with the racetrack and dense-packing basing modes for the system, the Air Force's timetable to have everything in place, and questioned the cost and effectiveness of the modes.\ While opposing the federal government on the Weteye bombs and the MX missile, Gov. Matheson worked closely with the federal government's request to reduce gasoline consumption. In a statewide program to cut gasoline usfrom the 1978 figure by 5 percent, Gov. Matheson ordered strict enforcement of the 55 mph speed limit.\ He supported the slogan ""Discover Utah First,"" suggesting Utahns travel within the state for vacations. Gov. Matheson also gave tax incentives to those who wanted to develop gasohol industries in the state.\ Gov. Matheson pulled out of the Western Governors Conference to devote more time to the Western Governors Policy Office.\ He was named Water Statesman of the Year by the National Water Resources Association because of his leadership as chairman of the water management subcommittee of the National Governors Association and his membership on the president's Intergovernmetnal Task Force on Water Policy.\ In 1980, an election year, Gov. Matheson was fighting the national government over CUP, the MX missile and the Weteye bombs.\ The threat of gas shortages prompted Gov. Matheson to issue an appeal for closer working relations with the Utah Transit Authority as his 1980 term began. This request eventually led to more UTA routes and longer hours of bus service.\ On the local front, he supported Planned Parenthood when local governments withdrew their aid in preference to having the health departments assume a role on the distribution of contraception information. He also supported the Equal Rights Amendment.\ Despite state opposition to these last two items, Gov. Matheson defeated former Republican Party state chairman Robert Wright in a Republican landslide year in which Utah gave GOP presidential candidate Ronald Reagan the greatest plurality vote of any state in the nation.\ During 1980, Gov. Matheson received an honorary doctorate from Southern Utah State College and the Bridger Award from Utah State University. The Bridger Award was for his leadership in the management of the state's natural resources.\ In his 1981 Utah budget message to the Legislature, Gov. Matheson proposed to increase the state's gasoline tax by 3 cents per gallon; to boost mineral severance taxes across-the-board, incorporating a new coal production tax; and increase motor vehicle registration and driver's license fees by $5.\ After a three-year battle with the federal government, Gov. Matheson had to abandon the idea of taking legal action to prevent transportation of the containers of nerve gas used in Weteye bombs, and allowed the bombs to be moved to Tooele.\ Some of the highlights of his 1981 governorship were vetoing a bill that would have repealed the prevailing wage law, and favoring states to pick up part of the cost of building federal water projects to prevent the federal government from dictating to the states.\ Gov. Matheson also struggled to create an appellate division of the district court to hear appeals from circuit courts and from administrative agencies whose appeals were heard by the Supreme Court. This idea did not materialize until after he left office.\ In 1981, Gov. Matheson was voted chairman of the National Governors Conference for 1982-1983, and was the recipient, along with his wife, of the National Humanitarian Award of the National Jewish Hospital-National Asthma Center.\ A new battle with the federal government was created in 1982 when Gov. Matheson opposed the Department of Energy's proposed nuclear dump site in Canyonlands National Park.\ In November he declared he would no longer request DOE grants to monitor nuclear waste dump sites in Utah. He said he did not agree with the department's proposed nuclear waste programs for the state, and the DOE was becoming less willing to give money to the state to monitor and review nuclear disposal sites.\ He recommended the state take its almost 5,000 scattered parcels of land and trade them for a handful of large, economically beneficial tracts of federal land. The proposal was named Project BOLD. Some of the parcels included Canyonlands. There was a value problem, however. And he asked the rhetorical question: Which was more valuable, the federal land or the scenic and historic lands like Canyonlands?\ In other affairs, he tried to get the Bureau of Indian Affairs to keep the Intermountain Intertribal School open in Brigham City, and he saved the state a 3 percent cutback in spending by using money saved in the Uniform School Fund.\ In his 1983 Utah budget speech to the Legislature, he proposed a $2 million state job-training act to help unemployed Utahns get new jobs. The bill, however, was not passed by the Legislature.\ He vetoed a bill to extend Utah's general election season by nearly a month and vetoed two cable television bills that would have given certain Utah factions the right to control the definition of pornography or indecency.\ On April 1, 1983, the tall, lanky governor entered Holy Cross Hospital for a tightness in his chest. This was later diagnosed as a mild heart attack.\ During his 8-day hospital stay, he grew a beard. Upon his release April 9, he flew to Thistle, Utah, to survey the damage caused by a mudslide in Spanish Fork Canyon that plugged the canyon's river, causing an overnight lake that plunged the small town under tens of feet of water.\ Gov. Matheson's popularity heightened in 1984 after he embarked on a 3-day airplane trip of the state where he gave numerous speeches in town halls and schools to win public support of his $100 million tax increase proposal to support education.\ At the time, it was the largest tax increase proposal in state history, but Gov. Matheson was able to win some public support for the concept because of his whistlestop-type tour of the state and his strategy of going directly to the people.\ After the legislative session ended in 1984, he stunned most political observers by announcing he would not seek a third term as governor. At the time, his popularity was the highest of any governor in state history.\ After leaving office, he was appointed chairman of the Democratic National Policy Council in 1985, and at his death was a partner in the Salt Lake law firm of Parsons, Behle & Latimer.\ Earlier this year, Gov. Matheson withdrew his name from consideration as President Bush's nuclear waste negotiator, citing personal reasons. As governor, he was an outspoken opponent of locating a high-level nuclear waste repository in his native southern Utah.\ Other accomplishments included a stint as vice chairman of the Utah State Bar Youth Education for Citizenship Committee. He was a Utah delegate to the American Bar Association House of Delegates since 1973 and was a Utah Bar commissioner for six years. He was also vice president and a trustee of the Utah Bar Foundation.\ He had married former Norma Warenski. Besides his widow, he is survived by a daughter and three sons, Mary Lee `Lu', Scott Jr., James and Thomas.\ Funeral services are pending."
230,"For more than 20 years, no matter who the governor has been, you know what you’re going to get from the annual State of the State speech.\It’s part cheerleading, part aspirational: The economy is strong, we’re investing in education, we need to clean up our air and keep taxes low. Gov. Gary Herbert’s speech Wednesday — his 10th since becoming governor — was no different.\It got me thinking about past speeches, both State of the State and State of the Union, and one that always stuck with me was President George W. Bush’s 2006 speech, where he called for a ban on human-animal hybrids. It was out of left field and caught people off guard and, as I stood in line at the grocery behind a pig-man last week, I couldn’t help but wonder how that was going.\That’s another characteristic of how these things go. After the spectacle and the lofty rhetoric, there’s not much attention paid to the follow-through. So I decided to look back at Herbert’s last nine speeches and see to what extent the governor delivered — or didn’t. Here’s a look.\Education\It’s a recurring theme in the governor’s annual speech, going back to his first in 2010. “I cannot say enough about the importance of supporting public education,” he said then. The next year, he went even further: “Therefore, in this legislative session, funding our children’s education MUST BE OUR NUMBER ONE BUDGET PRIORITY.” (His capitalization, so you know he means it).\It has indeed been a major priority. Since 2012, the state has put $1.8 billion of new money into education (both public and higher ed). Despite that, Utah remains last in the nation in per-pupil spending. In fact, at its peak, when Herbert took office, Utah was spending $7,111 per student, when adjusted for inflation, according to a Governing.com analysis of Census data. The most recent figures from 2016 show that figure is at $6,953.\Education is not all about money, as the governor has emphasized, so he has set other goals for Utah schools.\In 2011, Herbert touted a goal set by his education task force — to have school children proficient at reading by the third grade. Unfortunately, between 2013 and 2017, the percentage of third-graders who meet reading competency standards has declined slightly.\Perhaps his most notable education moonshot came in 2013, when Herbert announced: “Our goal is that 66 percent of our adult population will have a college degree or post-secondary certificate by the year 2020.”\Well, 2020 isn’t far off, and Utah has a lot of work to do.\According to Census data, as of 2017, 44 percent of Utahns over the age of 25 had associates degrees or better. And a report by the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems to higher ed officials last November said that just under half of the population over age 25 has at least a high-quality post-high school certificate.\And in 2015, Herbert set the goal of moving Utah into the Top 10 in the nation in graduation rates and math and literacy. In 2016, he set the goal of 90 percent graduation by 2020. As of 2017, Utah is 26th in graduation rates at 86 percent, and ranks 11th nationally in 8th grade reading and 14th in 8th grade math.\Energy\Every year, the governor touts Utah’s energy production, focusing on keeping energy cheap to attract businesses. In his 2010 address, he announced the Utah Energy Initiative.\“One of our true economic competitive advantages is our relatively low cost of power,” he said. “Our energy plan must focus on maintaining affordability, encouraging capital investment and protecting our environment.”\Turns out that the energy markets may be beyond the governor’s control. Overall energy production in the state decreased between 2010 and 2017, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Coal production is down, of course, but so is natural gas. Oil production and renewables are up, but just slightly.\Power is still cheap — significantly below the national average — but the cost of a kilowatt of energy has risen from 6.9 cents in 2010 to 8.6 cents in 2017, moving Utah from the third cheapest electricity in the country to seventh.\Jobs\When Herbert gave his first State of the State, the unemployment rate in Utah was 8 percent, the highest it had been since 1983, so getting people back to work post-recession was a point of emphasis.\In 2012, he set the goal “to accelerate private sector job creation of 100,000 jobs in 1,000 days.” It worked, as employment in the state grew by 112,000 over the next 32 months, although it wasn’t really much of an acceleration — it’s a growth rate of about 3 percent, which is the clip the state has grown on since 2011.\In 2017, Herbert shifted the job focus to rural Utah. “I would like us to unite behind a goal of creating 25,000 new jobs in the 25 counties off the Wasatch Front over the next four years.” Here we are two years later and there have been 25,857 jobs created in those 25 counties, although more than half of those have sprouted up in Washington and Cache counties.\Medicaid expansion\The governor didn’t like passage of the Affordable Care Act, but in his 2013 address, he called on the Legislature to make the best of a bad situation and find a way to expand Medicaid to cover low-income Utahns. “Assisting the poor in our state is a moral obligation that must be addressed,” he said.\The next year, he was urging them to pass a specific plan, his Healthy Utah proposal, which would have covered those below poverty and subsidized insurance for those making slightly more. The Legislature torpedoed that plan and a subsequent plan Herbert worked out with legislative leaders. That led to Proposition 3, the voter-passed initiative to expand Medicaid that Republican lawmakers are in the process of scaling back.\Taxes\This year, Herbert is pushing for a $225 million sales tax cut, the largest in state history, and, indeed, keeping taxes low has been a frequent theme. In 2012, he was his most categorical. “As I did last year, and the year before that, in order to sustain our successful economic recovery, I say to you today and to the people of Utah: No new taxes!”\His record, for the most part, follows that pledge. However, in 2010, he approved a $1-per-pack cigarette tax hike. And in 2015 he signed into a law two tax increase, one to local property taxes and the other a nickel-per-gallon increase to the gas tax. And, of course, last year, he helped push for a ballot measure that would have raised gas taxes again and diverted the money to education.\Credit: By Robert Gehrke"
231,"Ted Stewart is Gov. Mike Leavitt's new right-hand man. Literally.\Armed with unassailable conservative credentials, Stewart will work at shoring up the governor's sagging political right flank.\As Leavitt's new chief of staff, Stewart is perhaps the most powerful appointed official in the executive branch of state government, overseeing its day-to-day operations.\His appointment was announced and made effective last week. He steps into a job that has been in flux for months, with two short-term occupants. And he arrives at a time when there is a widening gulf between Leavitt and the Republican Party's right wing -- particularly rural conservatives.\Leavitt spokeswoman Vicki Varela denies Stewart was picked because he is a conservative with strong ties to rural elected officials. But she acknowledges it couldn't hurt.\``That turned out to be gravy,'' says Varela. ``That wasn't the determining factor, but it will help {smooth relations with rural conservatives}. There's no question.''\It could be a big job.\Consider these developments:\-- In a display of public discord rare for elected Utah Republicans, Congressman Chris Cannon criticized Leavitt for vetoing legislation that would have given state support for lawsuits opposing the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Cannon even called on lawmakers to override Leavitt's veto.\-- The Legislature's powerful Rural Caucus -- sometimes called the ``Cowboy Caucus'' -- continually challenges Leavitt on policy issues from last year's gas-tax increase to open-space preservation initiatives and child-care regulation.\-- The governor's vocal stand on restricting Utah's wide-open concealed weapons laws has placed him at odds with gun-rights advocates, including Utah Republican Party Chairman Rob Bishop.\Stewart -- perhaps warming to the spin control that is part of his new job -- downplays the rift.\``Urban versus rural is one of those natural dividing lines,'' he says. ``It's nothing new. There's a natural tension there.''\But Stewart, who grew up on a dairy farm in Weston, Idaho, makes no secret about where his sympathies lie.\``Small-town rural America is a very special part of our country. It is a part of our society that deserves special attention, particularly when government has policies that endanger it,'' Stewart says.\``To the extent I can, I have a responsibility to bridge {urban and rural} interests,'' he adds. ``My goal is to ensure that the governor's agenda is successfully carried out.''\The 49-year-old Stewart is an attorney who has for the past five years run the Utah Department of Natural Resources. There, he oversaw a sweeping reorganization aimed in part at appeasing farmers and ranchers upset with wildlife management policies. He also proved adept at dealing with the Legislature's cowboy-boot-shod Rural Caucus, which keeps a tight rein on natural resources issues.\Stewart ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1992, finishing a close third in the Republican convention behind Bob Bennett and Joe Cannon, both of whom siphoned personal fortunes to campaign.\In a fiery convention speech, Stewart vowed to ``rip the mask'' of moderation from ``liberal'' Democrat Wayne Owens, a longtime supporter of wilderness in Utah.\Prior to that unsuccessful campaign, Stewart served for seven years on the Public Service Commission, where he honed the art of compromise and negotiation on mammoth utility cases, including the merger of Utah Power & Light with Portland-based PacifiCorp.\Stewart's political career began in 1980, when he worked on Rep. Jim Hansen's first congressional campaign. After Hansen defeated veteran Democrat Gunn McKay, Stewart went to Washington as the Republican's administrative aide.\In that job, he helped craft the 1984 bill designating 740,000 acres of Forest Service lands in Utah as protected wilderness. The deal was cut one sweaty August day in the Kamas office of the Forest Service as Stewart, a representative of then Sen. Jake Garn and environmentalist Dick Carter attacked a map with red pencils.\``Back in those days, environmentalists were a bit more willing to talk,'' Stewart recalls now.\While adhering to conservative roots and principles, Stewart insists he is ever willing to come to the table, to compromise.\``I have characterized myself as a radical moderate,'' he says.\His early reviews are good.\Positive comments are pouring in even from conservative critics of Leavitt administration policies -- from Rep. Cannon to House Speaker Mel Brown and the Utah Association of Counties.\``When I have a rural issue, I give Ted a call,'' acknowledges Cannon. ``He really does understand rural Utah and he has been every place in rural Utah.''\Cannon -- who is lined up against Leavitt on the monument lawsuit issue -- admits Stewart is going to be a tough opponent on a veto override.\``It's not hard to identify the people who are on the margins, and Ted will be very influential with those people who aren't firm one way or the other,'' Cannon says.\The Utah Association of Counties' (UAC) associate director Mark Walsh calls Stewart's appointment ``a great move on the part of the governor.''\``{Stewart} will bring a dimension to the governor's office that the rural areas are going to be very pleased with,'' said Walsh, whose organization would have received state aid for its anti-monument lawsuit in the bill that Leavitt vetoed.\``If I were able to work my will, I would override that veto,'' Walsh says. ``Ted's role may be in trying to persuade legislators and others to hold the line.''\Speaker Brown would not venture a guess on a veto override, saying a poll of lawmakers was under way.\The first two-term House speaker in more than a decade, Brown has been a leader in the drive to increase the Legislature's power and stature in relation to the executive branch. He often sides with the Rural Caucus against Leavitt initiatives -- such as on issues of open-space conservation and firearms restrictions.\But Brown disputes the notion that Leavitt has a troubled relationship with rural conservatives.\``Heck no. I don't think the governor needs shoring up there,'' he insists.\Still, he adds, Stewart is a good person for building bridges to rural Utah.\``His own philosophical leanings align him with the rural and conservative constituencies. There's no question that if that is managed correctly, that relationship will be enhanced,'' Brown says.\Even environmentalists praise Stewart's appointment -- albeit faintly.\``The best thing about him is he makes you feel like he's listening to you,'' says Lawson LeGate, Sierra Club Southwest regional representative.\``In an area where tempers can flare and feelings run high, someone who is able to take the gentle approach is always to be appreciated,'' LeGate says.\``The downside,'' adds LeGate, ``is having watched and listened to Ted for many years, he is one of the harder core anti-wilderness politicians in the state. He has some very rigid views about those kinds of issues -- wilderness, endangered species protection, wetlands protection.''\Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance issues director Scott Groene is reserving judgment.\``With the steps of vetoing the monument legislation and distancing himself from anti-wilderness legislation in Congress, the governor seems to be taking a path toward a more positive record on the environment,'' Groene says. ``We would hope Ted's appointment is not inconsistent with this new direction.''"
232,"
SALT LAKE CITY - State lawmakers appear poised to spend as much as $14 million to sue the federal government over control of public lands as the Utah Legislature opened its 2016 general session Monday.
\
Lawmakers started the 45-day session on a somber note, holding a moment of silence in the House and Senate for fallen Unified police officer Doug Barney, who was gunned down at the scene of a traffic accident on Jan. 17. His funeral was Monday.
\
""We live in a country of peace. Yes, we just recognized the loss of one who was charged for our protection. Our hearts go out to his family, but for the most part our lives are peaceful,"" Senate President Wayne Niederhauser, R-Sandy, said in his opening speech.
\
House Speaker Greg Hughes, R-Draper, also addressed the fatal shooting, as well as the injuries sustained by another officer on the scene, Jon Richey, in his speech to the House.
\
""We remain committed to the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to ensure we all live in a safe environment,"" Hughes said to sustained applause from representatives.
\
Both Niederhauser and Hughes spoke of their goals for the session, laying out agendas that include action on education, water, air quality and transportation, as well as taking on the federal government over its control of public lands.
\
Last month, a commission dominated by Republican lawmakers voted to draft a lawsuit with the goal of eventually transferring federal public lands into state ownership.
\
A team of lawyers the Legislature hired told lawmakers there is a chance Utah could take the case directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, which would cost about $14 million. Attorney General Sean Reyes' office is currently reviewing the recommendation.
\
""This is an issue that does not have to be partisan. This is an issue that does not have to be filled with rancor and dissension,"" Hughes told the House to applause from Republicans but not Democrats.
\
A lawsuit combined with the public lands initiative recently introduced in Congress by Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, he said, ""gives us our greatest chance to not only make this fight but win this fight and see finally our public lands managed by this state.""
\
Hughes said he's had it with what he described as the federal government's attempt at ""population control."" He said 90 percent of Utahns live on 1 percent of the state's land, ""a form of gerrymandering"" that limits their influence since representation in Congress is based on population.
\
The speaker said later in an interview the potential cost of the lawsuit has gotten a lot of attention, but the actual price tag has not yet been determined. He said lawmakers would ""not just throw out a dollar amount and work backward.""
\
Hughes said he does not have ""a defined, step-by-step process"" for advancing the issue this session but expects to see at least the legislative and executive branches, along with Utah's congressional delegation, working together toward a common goal.
\
Niederhauser, who did not raise the public lands issue in his speech to the Senate, told reporters later he believes Utah has a case to make before the high court because it wasn't treated the same as other states.
\
""If we don't go ahead and force this question, there'll continue to be turmoil over whether the state ought to move forward to try and get the lands in state control rather than in federal control,"" he said. ""I think it's time that we settled the question and then deal with the results of that.""
\
Senate Minority Leader Gene Davis, D-Salt Lake City, said lawmakers need to weigh whether the lawsuit is worth the cost. Democrats have said there are better uses for the money.
\
""This a public policy issue on one hand and legal issue on another, and it's going to get complicated,"" Davis said.
\
Sen. Majority Leader Ralph Okerlund, R-Monroe, said the lawsuit would be worth the cost because the state could reap billions of dollars in revenue from resources that are now locked up.
\
But, Niederhauser said, state control doesn't mean privatization of the lands, adding that people want them to remain public.
\
""This is not about development,"" he said.
\
In his Senate speech, Niederhauser said lawmakers must have courage and vision to make ""decisions of a century"" now on difficult issues that impact Utah's future.
\
""Sometimes there are pitchforks and torches, but that's our job,"" he told senators.
\
Lawmakers, Niederhauser said, shouldn't limit or dictate what should or shouldn't be considered during the session because the Legislature is designed to decide matters that people bring forward.
\
""And thank heavens it's only 45 days. Let's never extend it,"" Niederhauser said.
\
The Senate president noted that lawmakers took on tough issues last year in raising the gas tax for the first time in 17 years and approving a new site for the state prison. He said lawmakers need to continue to ""pay it forward.""
\
Hughes praised House members for not taking ""the easy way out"" on difficult decisions, ""not even in the face of what I think might have been some of the most searing criticism that I have felt and that I know we have all felt.""
\
The speaker also referred to last session's battle over Medicaid expansion that pitted the House against both the Senate and GOP Gov. Gary Herbert, suggesting their differences were overplayed by the media.
\
""We know the truth,"" Hughes said, calling the House's working relationship with the governor ""incredible,"" even though there are times when there is disagreement.
\
In a speech that lasted nearly an hour, the speaker said he hopes to make progress this session on improving air quality with a long-term goal of ending ""red air"" days in the state and advancing water development.
\
He also called for lawmakers to ""fulfill the vision of our late Speaker Becky Lockhart"" and push for more technology in Utah classrooms.
\
Lockhart had tried unsuccessfully to win approval for replacing textbooks with computers. She died shortly before the start of the 2015 Legislature after a brief battle with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare and fatal brain disorder that has no cure. She was 46.
\
Later, Hughes said he sees that initiative as less oriented toward buying computers and more focused on training for teachers to ensure the devices eventually purchased are used.
\
House Minority Leader Brian King, D-Salt Lake City, said he was disappointed that Hughes failed to acknowledge Democrats' role in getting important bills passed.
\
""He chose to highlight legislative actions that require bipartisan support, while at the same time treating the Democrats as invisible,"" he said.
\
King said if the Legislature wants to invest in education in a way that is sustainable and will make the state competitive in the future, lawmakers cannot pat themselves on the back for funding growth and pitch technology programs the state doesn't need.
\
Utah needs well-paid teachers and salaries that encourage people to go into that profession, funding that lowers classroom sizes, and an education system where students are taught the best information in the best way based on their individual needs, he said.
\
""An iPad cannot do that. A teacher can,"" King said.
\
In addition to speeches from legislative leaders, the session's first day included music and prayer.
\
Elder Ronald A. Rasband, one of the newest members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, gave the invocation in the Senate. Elder Gary Stevenson, also a new member of the Quorum of the Twelve, prayed in the House.

233,"It’s easy to pick on Utah lawmakers.\They pass goofy laws, take embarrassing stands and, when they aren’t doing those things, they’re producing perhaps the most ridiculous rap video in the history of the world.\But, look, bullying is never OK, no matter how deserved it might be. And there are times — perhaps not as often as we would like — that these people make a real difference. So as the 2018 session draws to a close, here are a few things they got right, a few they got wildly wrong and a couple where the jury is still out.\The Good\Suicide prevention • Utah experienced a spike in suicides in 2016, and Rep. Steve Eliason, R-Sandy, and Sen. Daniel Thatcher, R-West Valley City, deserve credit for addressing the problem.\The duo got about $5 million to expand the statewide mental health crisis line, increase the use of mobile crisis outreach teams, give grants for suicide prevention training and beef up the SafeUT suicide prevention phone app — which, by the way, was recently downloaded more than 10,000 times in a week.\And Eliason and Sen. Curt Bramble, R-Provo, passed House Bill 139, which would allow Medicaid to pay for teleconferenced psychiatric counseling, ensuring that people in rural Utah can access such services.\The bills were the culmination of a yearlong task force aimed at trying to expand suicide prevention programs and would ultimately save lives.\UTA reform • It was years overdue, but the Legislature finally blew up the Utah Transit Authority and rebuilt it into something that hopefully will be more responsive, accountable and effective.\Sen. Wayne Harper, R-Taylorsville, and Rep. Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, navigated the competing interests and put together a plan that probably isn’t perfect, but it should be better than what exists now. What’s more, it infuses state money into the mass transit options we’ll need to keep pace with a growing population.\Climate resolution • Most of the resolutions approved by the Legislature are pointless. And while House Concurrent Resolution 7, sponsored by Rep. Becky Edwards, R-North Salt Lake, isn’t likely to change the world, it might be a first step toward changing Utah.\With this resolution, the conservative Legislature is recognizing that the climate is changing, that we need to conserve and be good stewards of our resources, and that sound science should drive decisions when it comes to our environment.\The bill passed the House by a convincing margin, despite opposition from the predictable naysayers, and it is expected to get through the Senate.\The Tesla bill • Rep. Kim Coleman, R-West Jordan, has been trying to change the law after the state in 2015 denied Tesla Motors a license to sell cars here, a decision that was litigated and ultimately upheld by the Utah Supreme Court.\Every time Coleman tried, she got run over by the car dealerships and their lobbying group.\This year, however, the New Car Dealers of Utah put a compromise on the table that passed the House unanimously and looks certain to make it through the Senate. House Bill 369 would let Tesla and other makers of electricity- or hydrogen-powered cars get a new type of license so manufacturers can sell directly to consumers, without franchising with a car dealership.\Ideally, this wouldn’t have taken years to accomplish, but it would ultimately benefit consumers, and it proves that persistence pays.\Not screwing things up • A big part of succeeding is in not failing, and the Legislature avoided some opportunities to mess things up in a big way.\Rep. Mike Noel’s bill to name a network of highways connecting southern Utah’s national parks for President Donald Trump appears to be stuck in the House. The Kanab Republican’s bill to strip Salt Lake City of its authority to protect Wasatch canyons’ watershed got voted down. And Orem Republican Rep. Keven Stratton’s needless bill to create a superpowered investigatory committee, which would let the Legislature go poking around pretty much anywhere it wants, looks like it’s not going anywhere.\Some other wins • Schultz’s bill to get rid of noncompete clauses for much of the broadcast world; several good clean-air bills, including a diesel testing measure; Senate President and Sandy Republican Wayne Niederhauser’s bill to facilitate toll roads in the Cottonwood canyons; Salt Lake City Democratic Rep. Angela Romero’s bill expanding domestic violence protections.\The Bad\Don’t hate; litigate • It feels like Sen. Stuart Adams, R-Layton, is itching for a fight, and we get to pay for it. His Senate Bill 171 would require state courts to let the Legislature intervene in lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of new laws.\The attorney general’s office, as you might imagine, has some objections, since its only job is to represent the state and defend the Legislature’s laws. Adams can’t really point to cases where the Legislature wasn’t adequately represented, but he got $700,000 to hire outside lawyers to represent the Legislature in future cases.\Attorneys from the A.G.’s office testified against the bill, saying it may violate the constitutional separation of powers, which means the law about who represents the Legislature in court ... could end up in court.\More secrecy • I guess we’ve gotten used to the Senate conducting its real debates in closed caucuses. But this session, the House Republicans — who had traditionally opened most of their meetings — shut down their discussions as well.\What we’re left with is a legislative process that is strictly for show, at least when it comes to controversial legislation. We only get to see a real debate if lawmakers allow the public to weigh in on bills, and that doesn’t even happen all of the time.\Missed opportunities • The Legislature missed its chance to fix its unenforceable 0.05 DUI law, although Rep. Norm Thurston, R-Provo, did make it OK for someone who is legally drunk to have a gun. The Legislature also punted on trying to enact a workable hate crimes bill, despite pleas from cities and counties across the state, and a bill to repeal the death penalty once again failed to get a vote on the House floor.\The ‘Let’s See’\Our Schools Now compromise • It’s got a ways to go, but the Legislature looks like it may put a gas tax increase on the ballot that would supplant the Our Schools Now initiative and could give voters a chance to raise their taxes to support public education. There are plenty of what-ifs, like what if voters reject the ballot measure in November? But the concept is good and we’ll see where it ends up.\School governance shakeup • On his way to retirement, Sen. Jim Dabakis, D-Salt Lake City, dropped a doozy of a bill that would amend the Utah Constitution and get rid of the elected state Board of Education, giving more authority to the governor. It was Dabakis, so a lot of people didn’t expect it to pass, then it ended up getting a lot of support.\Turns out the school board is pretty dysfunctional. Most people don’t know who their school board member is, which means they’re mostly unaccountable, and those who do know are the people who are really, really passionate about things like getting rid of Common Core and keeping the United Nations out of classrooms. This is, however, a huge change, and it will take a long time for the dust to settle, if it happens at all.\No answers for gun violence • After the mass shooting in Florida last month, you might think the Legislature would take action to address the more than one Utahn who dies from a gunshot every single day. You might think the same after Las Vegas, or Orlando or Sandy Hook. And you’d be wrong.\The one proposal that was brought forward to deal with gun violence, an attempt to make it easier for a court to take away the guns of those whose mental state make them dangerous to themselves or others, was defeated.\Legislative leaders have said they want to address this issue in the coming months. It will be up to all of us to make sure they do.\Credit: By Robert Gehrke"

SALT LAKE CITY - Just as air pollution legislation or air quality funding priorities have jockeyed for Utah lawmakers' attention in previous sessions, expect the 2016 Legislature to test their mettle on water issues.
\
It may be the next five weeks shape up to be ground zero to gauge lawmakers' resolve to fund millions in water development projects, or if they are willing to commit $6 million to determine how much drinking water capacity is needed for individual municipal systems.
\
With the session's inaugural week coming to a close, a legislative committee has already dealt with an early storm of criticism over SB80, which proposes to take $35.8 million in annual sales tax revenue going to transportation and put it in a water infrastructure fund.
\
Critics say it is a sneaky way to help pay for the controversial Lake Powell pipeline or its sister development project, the proposal to divert water from the Bear River, build a dam and send it south to the Wasatch Front.
\
Senate Majority Whip and sponsor Stuart Adams, R-Layton, says the bill is not so much about specific projects but more about putting money into a much-needed bank account to address an array of water needs necessary for a near doubling of the state's population by 2050.
\
Even with the millions generated each year to finance water infrastructure, Adams and other proponents of the sales tax diversion say the dollars will amount to just the proverbial drop in the bucket of what is necessary overall.
\
With the federal government strapped for cash and no longer able to fund all the needs of aging dams and supporting conveyance systems, Weber Basin Water Conservancy District General Manager Tage Flint stressed that some of the fixes are already overdue.
\
An independent assessment of 26 miles of the Weber and Davis aqueducts, for example, found that the aging pipelines serving a half million people in the two counties have several segments in need of rehabilitation or repair. Flint said the Davis aqueduct is 65 years old and nearing the end of its engineering life.
\
Adams told the Senate Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment Committee that the state may have a long tradition of funding statewide road projects and directing money to education, but it has neglected its water needs over decades.
\
The state's gas tax, he reminded his colleagues, was bumped nearly 5 cents last year for roads, and lawmakers also raised property tax for education.
\
""Water has been neglected, so the question is: How do we fund water? We have a great need for large water projects, and the challenge with funding those is most of the people who will drink from those large water projects have yet to show up,"" Adams said.
\
The committee passed the bill 5-2 for full Senate consideration, but some lawmakers are not sold on the state diving in to play the loan officer on large water projects.
\
Their concerns echo that of Gov. Gary Herbert, who in his budget proposal said such a move would be a ""major expansion"" of the state's role. He added that diversion of sales tax revenue would create a permanent taxpayer subsidy for water development.
\
Herbert said that any general fund appropriations for water development should remain ""very scarce"" until a long list of conditions are met, including a three-year study analyzing water use, implementation of an improved water data collection system, conservation pricing and a repayment feasibility study.
\
Eric Milles, director of the Utah Division of Water Resources, said the governor's cautionary recommendations do not derail the Lake Powell pipeline or the Bear River development projects, which were both approved years ago by the Utah Legislature as ""state"" projects. The pipeline is in the very early stages of planning - it is barely undergoing an environmental review - and the Bear River project doesn't plan for water being needed until 2035.
\
""I think what this means is that we analyze and look very carefully at the projects the state is involved with,"" Milles said. ""There's been a lot of talk going around on the funding of (the Lake Powell pipeline) and other projects,"" Milles said. ""The governor wants to ensure that our limited water resources are being used wisely and appropriately. He also wants to make sure that the state maintains an appropriate role in funding water projects that is fiscally prudent and sustainable.""
\
In his proposed budget for fiscal year 2016, Herbert is recommending $6 million in new money to pay for a three-year study by the Utah Division of Drinking Water. The study request comes after a late-2014 audit of the division's capacity requirements for municipal drinking water providers.
\
The rules for drinking water connections governing how much water is needed to meet peak demand have not been changed since 1979, the audit said, even though in the ensuing decades indoor water use has declined due to conservation and better technology.
\
Minimum state water requirements are based on factors that include capacity, storage and pipelines, but auditors said the minimum sourcing requirements appeared too high.
\
Ken Bousfield, division director, said systems have to be able to meet daily demands, peak use and beyond peak use, such as an extremely hot day, excessive use and a fire that breaks out on top of that.
\
Auditors found that average indoor water use in three major urban areas was 40 to 50 percent less than the gallon per day requirement imposed by the state.
\
Bousfield requested new money to pay for a three-year study involving smart meters on different municipal water providers in varying geographic regions of the state.
\
The study would also involve placing smart meters on hundreds of individual households to measure indoor water use in five- or 10-minute increments to better accurately benchmark peak use compared with average use. The study is to be carried out over multiple years, Bousfield added, to determine how much water use varies from year to year if climate conditions are different.
\
There is also about $450,000 being recommended in Herbert's budget to beef up water data collection efforts that include on-the-ground training by state agencies with local water providers to boost the accuracy of the numbers being submitted.
\
""What we have proposed to do is directly interact with public utilities that are reporting water use,"" said Boyd Clayton, deputy state engineer. ""We send out a form and tell them to report and answer their questions if they call. We don't develop relationships, and we think that is the missing piece of this collection of data.""
\
In a separate probe, auditors questioned the numbers behind the state's projections for water needs, the available supply and the current accounting system for water use, noting the numbers were off and in many cases outdated.
\
Clayton said he believes having a full-time employee dedicated to water collection data and building ""face time"" with reporting agencies will improve that effort.
\
The water rights division will also get a little more than half a million dollars to accelerate its adjudication of water rights, a tedious process that is dramatically behind schedule.
\
Sen. Margaret Dayton, R-Orem, is running SB75 to streamline the process of verifying, documenting and recording water right claims, an approach Clayton said can cut the time required by as much as half.
\
Herbert wants another $300,000 to improve water conservation practices in state buildings and $300,000 for conservation incentives such as rebates.
\
In the conservation arena, Sen. Scott Jenkins, R-Plain City, is sponsoring SB28, which requires culinary water providers to establish a rate structure that increases with use. The bill would establish a rate increase for every block of water a customer uses.
\
While the majority of water systems throughout Utah already have ""conservation"" pricing in effect, Jenkins has said this would capture those few systems that don't.
\
Jenkins is also running a resolution, SCR1, which encourages all water systems - culinary and secondary - to move to universal metering. Some districts, such as Jordan Valley and Weber Basin that have universal metering for some of their customers, have found water use is drastically decreased.
\
About a dozen water bills have been unveiled so far in the session, all being watched by varying groups with different motives.
\
The Utah Farm Bureau, for instance, is hoping water for agriculture is safeguarded.
\
""With Utah's population doubling in the next several decades, the pressure to transfer and convert agriculture water to municipal and industry use will intensify. As these pressures mount, sustaining a vibrant production agriculture industry and a growing rural Utah economy is essential,"" said Randy Parker, the bureau's chief executive officer.
\
Parker added that local, county and state governments must also act to make sure the generations of farmers and ranchers have access to a reliable and adequate water distribution system, especially as pipelines age and population grows.

235,"Copyright 1993, THE SALT LAKE TRIBUNE\ John ""JJ"" Jones has to contend with a hostile work environment.\ His place of business is a place where red-faced people shout insults and make obscene gestures. It's a place you could get killed.\ JJ Jones -- Trooper Jones -- works Interstate 15 in the heart of the Salt Lake Valley.\ ""It's a terrible amount of stress that we don't need,"" he says of rush-hour traffic on the metro area's only north-south freeway.\ ""Everybody's funneled into this one area to get into town, and everybody's in a hurry,"" adds the Utah Highway Patrol trooper. ""The stress comes through in accidents. They're all pushing each other down the road and eventually they hit each other.""\ Each weekday, 106,000 cars travel on Interstate 15, making it the busiest stretch of pavement in the state.\ It soon may be the most expensive as well. The Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) wants to pump $2 billion worth of improvements into the commuter corridor -- adding two lanes in each direction -- and connector roads.\ Utah taxpayers would finance the decade of construction -- probably through a bump in the state gasoline tax. Boosting the current 19 cent-per-gallon tax by a dime would add $30 a year to the gasoline bill of the average driver.\ Think of I-15 as a giant funnel. Each morning, cars from the south end of the valley flow into the funnel to be shoved together out the narrow northern end at downtown Salt Lake City.\ With every new driver, a little more metal is poured into the funnel. At current population-growth rates, nearly 155,000 cars and trucks will be on the freeway every weekday in 2015, according to UDOT estimates.\ The most congested part of the freeway, between the I-80 interchange and 3300 South, already is at ""failure rate"" -- defined as stop-and-go traffic -- every daylight hour. Without improvements, UDOT says, I-15 from Draper to downtown Salt Lake City will be at failure rate every minute of the day by 2003.\ Yet, if all goes well for UDOT, I-15 soon will be a much bigger and better funnel. The width would double in some places, nearly every interchange in Salt Lake County would be revamped and there would be new high-tech traffic controls.\ Access to downtown Salt Lake City will be improved with new ramps at 200 South and 400 South to ease the burden on the current single-access point at 600 South.\ And the new I-15 could have Utah's first high-occupancy vehicle lanes reserved for cars, vans and buses hauling more than one passenger.\ UDOT's consultants, Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade & Douglas, are working out the details of the freeway overhaul. Public hearings on the plan will begin in September. But work won't go beyond the drawing board unless UDOT can convince the Legislature, the federal government, Utah motorists and taxpayers that it is worth the $2 billion price tag.\ That won't be easy. ""I do not get any indication from the Legislature that this is an open-and-shut deal,"" says Senate Majority Leader Lane Beatty. ""This is going to be a tough sell.""\ Most lawmakers agree that Utah is behind other states on highway spending. But the state also needs money for education, public safety and other programs, Mr. Beatty, R-West Bountiful, notes.\ I-15 was built largely with federal funds during the massive nationwide freeway construction spree in the early 1960s. Rebuilding Utah's busiest freeway will rest largely on the pocketbooks of Utahns. The federal government doesn't cover all repair costs.\ Fixing and expanding I-15 alone would cost as much as $1 billion. UDOT also wants another $1 billion to improve the east-west system of arterials that feeds traffic to the freeway.\ Too Much, Too Late? Relief won't come anytime soon. Even if UDOT makes every deadline in its schedule, construction won't start until 1996 and the work won't be complete until 2003.\ ""Any time we start rebuilding Interstate 15 it will be too late,"" UDOT Director W. Craig Zwick says of the long construction timetable.\ And even with the improvements, traffic conditions will remain exactly as they are now. Currently, the average rush-hour speed from Draper to downtown Salt Lake City is 45 mph -- exactly as it would be if all proposed freeway improvements are made.\ But with no expansion, the average speed from Draper to downtown would be just 15 mph in 2003, says Bob Parry, a UDOT freeway planner.\ If UDOT has its way, I-15 would become a bigger and better funnel, bulging from four to six lanes in the north and south ends of the valley and bulk up to eight lanes in the central valley. A new lane would be added in each direction in the center strip between 10800 South and 600 North while new lanes would go outside of the current ones between 9000 South and 2700 South. Most of the work can be done within the existing right of way, leaving most nearby homes and businesses intact.\ Those new lanes are crucial to improving the carrying capacity of the freeway, which was built to handle a maximum of about 1,500 cars per hour, per lane. Today, I-15 commonly carries 2,000 cars per hour in each lane. Traffic still moves, but even a minor disturbance can cause backups, delays and complete failure. Closing a lane cuts traffic flow in half.\ ""All it takes is for somebody with a flat tire to shut down the freeway,"" Mr. Parry says. In the eyes of a traffic engineer, I-15 from the I-80 interchange to 7200 South is no different than the dreaded Los Angeles freeway system.\ ""The only difference is in L.A. you have hundreds of miles of freeway that are as bad as what we're up against in just 5 miles at peak periods,"" Mr. Parry says.\ And as I-15 gets worse, its problems spill onto virtually every other north-south arterial in the valley. State-financed surveys show many drivers go out of their way to avoid I-15 between downtown and 3300 South because of congestion.\ Who Designed This? UDOT's I-15 work wouldn't be limited to doubling the size of the funnel, however. The agency also wants to take some kinks out of the freeway's antiquated design.\ The freeway was built to 1975 design standards -- standards now seen as horribly flawed. Take, for example, the intersection of I-15, 2100 South and I-80, where traffic coming off I-80 must cut immediately through frontage road traffic to merge onto I-15 northbound, causing traffic to slow and back up in all directions. Traffic engineers call this ""weaving,"" and say they can't imagine why anyone thought it was a good idea 20 years ago. ""We would never allow that to be built today,"" Mr. Parry says. Trooper Jones just might throw himself in front of the bulldozers if they tried.\ ""It was a can of worms from the start,"" Trooper Jones says of the interchange. ""The old-timers who were around then say they just stood around and asked, ""Who in the world designed this?' ""\ In UDOT's campaign to improve traffic flow and safety, no I-15 interchange would be spared the jackhammer. The list includes:\ -- Redesigning the ramps at 10600 South and 9000 South.\ -- Rebuilding the I-15/I-215 interchange in Murray.\ -- Rebuilding the bridge crossings at Vine Street, 3900 South and 2700 South.\ -- Converting the 3300 South, 4500 South, 5300 South and 7200 South interchanges to ""single-point urban interchanges,"" where cross traffic and access-ramp lanes are gathered at traffic signals underneath the bridges, eliminating backups due to left turns.\ -- Improving traffic flow to downtown with new ramps at 200 South and 400 South. Several alternatives are under consideration, but the best-developed plans would give traffic from I-80 a more direct route into downtown while giving drivers on I-15 more routes into downtown.\ Communities vs. Commuters: Downtown business owners say the new lanes and downtown ramps are critical to the viability of the business district.\ ""It's a real plus to be able to disperse traffic into downtown,"" says Robert Farrington, executive director of the Downtown Alliance. ""Right now, there's a bottleneck on 600 South with everybody funneled into one area that can't handle all that traffic.""\ But those who live on the downtown fringe say they fear the new intersection at 200 South simply would shift traffic headaches to the quiet, tree-lined streets between the new ramp and the University of Utah campus.\ ""It's a sacrifice of another neighborhood for downtown,"" says Ray Whitchurch, head of the Salt Lake Area Council's transportation committee and himself a resident of the east-central neighborhood.\ Mr. Whitchurch worries that 200 South would become the off-ramp of choice for commuters headed to the U. campus. His group already is lobbying for changes that would divert traffic off 200 South at 700 East. Ideally, he says, traffic would be routed onto already-busy 400 South.\ ""We can't keep trading off viable living spaces for commuters coming in from outside the city,"" Mr. Whitchurch says. Salt Lake City traffic engineer Tim Harpst says the city is aware of the concern and will consider traffic diversion. But he adds that it's too early in the planning process to say how the new flow of traffic will be handled.\ Smorgasbord of Revenue: UDOT also is studying innovations, already in use in most large cities, to make better use of the existing concrete. Ideas under study include:\ -- Lanes reserved only for vehicles with two or more occupants. The average car on the freeway can carry four people, but most people commute alone. By doubling up, traffic would be cut in half. The high-occupancy vehicle lanes would offer an incentive to car poolers by giving them a faster trip in return for sharing the ride.\ -- Ramp metering, or the installation of traffic signals at on-ramps to allow vehicles to trickle onto the freeway every two or three seconds, thus preventing jams when a steady stream of cars tries to merge into a steady stream of traffic.\ -- Giant, scoreboard-like message signs to warn drivers of problems ahead and give advice on how to avoid them.\ None of this comes cheap.\ UDOT Director Zwick has proposed a 15-cent-a-gallon tax increase for I-15 improvements and $1 billion to be spread around the rest of the state. The proposal won't go to the Legislature for months, but Mr. Zwick says he has received ""total affirmation"" for the increase -- even among people who don't live in the Salt Lake Valley.\ ""People, even those who only visit, recognize something has to be done,"" says Mr. Zwick, adding that the freeway will be financed through ""a smorgasbord of revenues"" rather than a single bump in the gasoline tax.\ Other items on the financial menu include:\ -- Increasing the sales tax on motor fuels; that would raise $45 million.\ -- Limiting the gas-tax bump to just 5-cents-a-gallon in Salt Lake County, raising $18 million.\ -- Doubling vehicle registration fees (autos and light trucks going from $11 to $20, heavy trucks rising by 30%), raising $30 million.\ -- Taxing heavy trucks by weight and distance traveled, raising $37 million.\ -- Adding a 1% local-option sales tax on all purchases in Salt Lake County, raising $89 million.\ -- Reserving 1% of the state's sales tax on automobiles and automotive products for the project.\ -- Boosting the state vehicle property tax by 10%, raising $6 million.\ -- Shifting $5 million from the highway patrol budget for construction.\ Other alternatives include charging tolls on new high-occupancy vehicle lanes; increasing the statewide sales tax by 1% and dedicating it to roads; having local governments help pay for interchange improvements; allowing a local-option payroll tax and dedicating it to highways; and increasing the driver-license renewal fee from $15 to $20.\ Mr. Zwick says the Legislature must adopt a financial package in January if the project is to stay on schedule.\ Trooper Jones, who is eligible for retirement, says he won't be around when UDOT cuts the ribbon -- if it ever does. He doesn't believe lawmakers will spend the money, or that commuters will car pool or shift to off-peak work schedules to ease the morning and evening crush.\ ""I deal with this by telling myself that it's a crisis and I'd just handle it the best way I can,"" he says. ""If you let it eat at you, it will eat you up."""
236,"Like an insurance executive pumping up his agents, Gov. Mike Leavitt has worked over small groups of lawmakers during the three weeks leading up to Monday's opening of the 51st Legislature.\With sleeves rolled up, using gee-whiz computer graphics and munching a sandwich during breaks in the 5-hour spiels, the 43-year-old workaholic dazzled some legislators.\""He is the best salesman in the history of that office,"" says a lawmaker who attended one of five sessions, which were closed to the press and the public.\Leavitt's pitch: Increase spending over last year's budget by $250 million. His $4.9 billion proposal contains some $83 million in unexpected tax collections -- the seventh straight year of surplus.\Utah's 104 lawmakers begin the annual 45-day session at 10 a.m. Monday, Martin Luther King Jr./Human Rights Day. They will begin by passing a resolution endorsing Leavitt's call for a national ""Conference of States"" to re-examine the balance of federal and state powers. A majority of the 50 states are expected to follow with identical resolutions.\The gut issues will come later: taxes, transportation, education funding and crime fighting. All told, legislators will snipe, pontificate and politick about some 1,000 bills and resolutions.\If the session follows tradition, about a third of the measures will pass. Few will be life-and-death issues for average Utahns.\Leavitt, a first-term Republican, is pushing a sweeping agenda he wants written into law. It ranges from creation of a new prison system for young offenders to plans for steering school class-size-reduction money to low-income neighborhoods.\Since 1984, when Utahns began the trend of electing Republican governors to match their GOP Legislature, chief executives generally have had their way with lawmakers.\But Leavitt, who has enjoyed success with the Legislature during his first two years, will meet resistance in the 1995 session.\Already, some conservative Republicans and House Democrats have criticized the governor's spending blueprint. Most gripes focus on hefty spending increases, the modesty of the plan's $30 million tax cut, and its proposed 4 percent pay hike for state employees and teachers.\Newly elected House Speaker Mel Brown is not inclined to rap the head of his party. But neither will the plain-spoken Midvale resident be cowed into blind allegiance to Leavitt. He speaks often about the importance of separating power in government.\""Yeah,"" drawls Brown, a dairy farmer with a gift for understatement, ""taxes and controlling the growth in government might be two of those issues we have to do some serious negotiating on.""\Most who attended Leavitt's five-hour sessions were impressed. But not everyone showed up.\""That's the executive branch leading the legislative branch and that's a touch unhealthy,"" says Rep. Met Johnson, leader of the loose-knit ""Cowboy Caucus"" of conservative, mostly rural legislators.\Johnson and several other lawmakers deliberately ducked the meetings to avoid being co-opted by Leavitt. The New Harmony maverick says his job is to represent southern Utah residents -- not succumb to the glamour of ""being wined and dined by any lobbyist, whether it's the governor or somebody else.""\House Democratic Whip Kelly Atkinson parts company with Leavitt on the governor's proposed $30 million tax cut. Himself a champion of a $60 million reduction, the West Jordan school union leader says: ""The governor's going to lose on this one.""\Democrats are staking a lot on the issue. Entering the first legislative session since their dismal Nov. 8 election showing, senior party members see the debate on tax cuts as a chance to remake their political image.\""We need to make the public aware of the gross Republican negligence when it comes to our sacred tax money,"" says Senate Minority Leader Scott Howell, D-Sandy, who has not committed to Atkinson's $60 million proposal.\""We Democrats have continued to let people be fooled that we are the tax-and-spend party when it's really our colleagues across the aisle,"" adds Howell.\Does the combination of hostile House Democrats and divided Republicans mean Leavitt's honeymoon with the Legislature is over?\""Was there a honeymoon?"" the governor responds. ""No, I've got good relationships with the Legislature. I always have had. I work hard at it.\""But the Legislature is a separate branch of government. They have to have their own point of view. I respect it.""\In private conversations, though, Leavitt acknowledges he is anxious about the session, likely the toughest of his administration.\Yet shifting political dynamics have brought him some new allies.\Traditionally, the Utah Education Association has relied on a bloc of Democrats and moderate Republicans to back increases in the school-funding formula that includes teacher pay and school construction. ""Now we're having as much trouble with Democrats as we are with Republicans,"" says association President Lily Eskelsen.\That has forced representatives for the state's teachers and government workers into the Leavitt camp.\""We consider him an ally,"" says Nancy Sechrest, head of the 7,300-member Utah Public Employees Association. ""But he's getting caught in the political cross fire.""\To begin with, the Legislature will train its sights on Washington.\Mandates: The 1995 Legislature will labor in the shadow of Congress. Fundamental policy decisions on Utah's Capitol Hill hinge on details of a proposed federal balanced-budget amendment sought by the new GOP majority in Washington.\Recent tallies from the Clinton administration indicate $422 million in federal aid to Utah may be at stake, including cash for highways, education, job training and health care to the poor. In exchange, states could take control of programs and services now dictated from afar.\On Monday, Utah will become the first state in the nation to officially call for a ""Conference of the States,"" an idea cooked up by states' rights advocate Leavitt months ago.\""I don't think there has been a more critical time in the history of the United States than we have right now,"" says Senate President Lane Beattie, R-West Bountiful. ""Congress will absolutely change what states do.""\Crime: Continuing a theme first sounded in the emergency session of October 1993, the 1995 Legislature plans more crime-fighting rhetoric, spending and prison construction.\A major proposal, backed by Leavitt, calls for a new system to punish serious juvenile offenders as young as 16 years old in adult courts and prisons. Other anti-gang steps could include stiffening penalties on graffiti and juveniles using firearms, as well as schemes for electronic monitoring of youths on probation.\Lawmakers also will consider mandating increased penalties for three-time felons and tougher punishment for domestic violence and certain sex crimes.\Much of the legislative debate will center around money for such things as prison construction and added staff in the justice system.\Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini says she will be ""pushing very hard"" to go beyond the governor's request for one more judge and eight new juvenile probation officers in Salt Lake County.\And while the mayor backs Leavitt's plan for 180 new juvenile-detention beds, she wants a total of 300 new beds.\Corradini and the Utah League of Cities and Towns predict a rematch of last year's fight about guns. Cities want the right to pass firearms-control ordinances tougher than state law -- and increasingly organized gun activists are bent on stopping them.\A task force that grew out of last year's stalemate has recommended against cities having that power. And most players -- including Corradini -- believe gun forces will win this time.\To that end, gun-rights activists plan a beefed-up presence on Capitol Hill this year. Many have been drawn to political action out of outrage about the recent passage of a federal waiting period on gun purchases and bans on semiautomatic weapons.\""We're not in the Reagan era anymore,"" says Scott Engen, lobbyist for the pro-gun Utah Shooting Sports Council. ""A lot of people are extremely hostile to our positions. We need to be at least as effective in countering that as they are in promoting their agenda.""\On the other side is the fledgling group, Utahns Against Gun Violence, a committed, but much smaller group of gun-control advocates.\Leavitt, who remains publicly neutral on the issue, is predicting cities will keep the right to regulate gun sales within their borders. ""That's just a forecast,"" he says, ""not necessarily an expression of preference.""\He calls the dispute about gun-purchasing laws ""much ado about nothing. It's strictly a political issue.""\Reform: New leaders in the House and Senate are promising to improve the Legislature's public image in the aftermath of successive polls indicating their constituents do not trust them.\Both chambers have opened up previously secret Rules Committees that screen bills, decide which committees debate them or if they receive debate. The House has opened the doors of its Rules Committee, while the Senate has created a new system giving the Senate president and committee heads the gate-keeping power.\Republican leaders promise debate on other key reform issues -- from lobbyist disclosure to tighter campaign-finance laws. But they have been vague on what changes might be expected.\""If they come up with legitimate changes, then I'll be supportive of them,"" says Beattie, whose dim view of legislative reforms helped kill them in 1994. ""But you have to ask yourself if there's a problem or if it's a matter of perception. I'm not going to support `smoke and mirrors' bills.""\Atkinson identifies reform as the sleeper issue of the session ""that could raise its head and bite the derriere of the Republicans.""\Morals: It would not be Utah -- where more than 80 percent of lawmakers are Mormon -- if a year went by without a few attempts to legislate morals.\This year, early prospects appear to be in the area of school prayer and ""values"" instruction in schools.\Lawmakers will take time the first day of the session to pass a resolution calling for classroom instruction on correct values and morality.\Also, ""Cowboy Caucus"" leader Johnson is sponsoring a resolution favoring schools' rights to hold a ""moment of silence"" in classrooms. But the proposal has no force of law, consisting merely of a statement ""urging"" Congress to act.\Leaders of the Democratic minority insist more radical morals bills will materialize.\""I expect to see a lot of legislation that is a violation of citizens' civil rights,"" says House Minority Whip Atkinson. ""The ultraconservative right wing of the -Republican} party is throwing out the message, `You'd better pull to the right or you won't be re-elected.' ""\Alcohol and Tobacco: A legislator is proposing adoption of the country's lowest blood-alcohol standards for drunken driving.\But the bill to lower the legal driving limit from 0.08 percent blood-alcohol content to 0.04 percent already is in trouble. The state's Criminal Justice Subcommittee, which includes representatives from police agencies and courts, opposes the change.\And the days of cash-only booze purchases may be over. A proposal legalizing credit-card and check purchases in state liquor stores has momentum after being endorsed by the state Alcohol Beverage Control Commission.\Legislators predict they will pass a bill requiring single packs of cigarettes to be placed behind the counter in all Utah stores. The measure is aimed at keeping tobacco away from minors.\There has been rumbling about the Jan. 1 imposition of Utah's smoke-free laws for restaurants, bowling alleys and most public buildings. But do not expect a reversal of the ban.\""I honestly have not heard of any effort to repeal it,"" says House Speaker Brown. ""I've found it awfully nice to be able to go into a restaurant and not have to sit and suck smoke.""\Issues Poll\A majority or plurality of Utahns polled last week had these messages for the Legislature: The governor's $30 million tax cut is about right, let cities enact their own gun laws, a gas-tax hike for roads is acceptable, and they are taking a wait-and-see stand on legislative reforms."
237,"As if the first eleven months of the year weren't enough, 2020 will end in a political crescendo as the nation elects its next set of local, state and national leaders.\But do you know all of the names on your ballot?\From the county commission to U.S. Congress, The Spectrum has compiled this guide to help introduce voters in Washington County to the candidates hoping to represent them.\This list has been limited to races that are competitive or contests where voters will get to choose between more than one candidate. Several races on the November ballot will only feature one candidate.\To keep the playing field level, each candidate was asked to fill out a standard form that asked them about their political history and offered a space to write a 1,500-character bio introducing themselves to voters.\In this article and in the following article running in Thursday's edition, we'll publish the responses from each candidate. Today's article starts by featuring the candidates for the Utah Legislature, with the candidates for Governor, Utah's 2nd Congressional District and the local county commission to come on Thursday. The full guide is available online at www.TheSpectrum.com and will remain on the front page until after Election Day.\Depending on where you live, voters in southwestern Utah will weigh in on one of five state legislative races. All but one of those races — State House District 71 — are competitive, meaning voters will have a choice between more than one candidate.\Incumbent Republican Brad Last is the presumptive winner of HD 71, which covers much of western Washington County and Iron County. In that race, there's no Democratic candidate and Last defeated Republican challenger Willie Billings during the June primary election.\With the exception of the city of Washington, State Senate District 29 largely covers the western half of Washington County, including St. George, Ivins, Veyo and Santa Clara.\The seat is currently held by Don Ipson, who is running for reelection in 2020.\Chuck Goode\Party: Democrat\Has the candidate previously held a public office? No.\Brief bio: My values are fairness, dignity and equality for everyone. Inequality has divided us. This is why I am running for office - to improve people's lives.\SALES TAX: I think it's time for families to have a tax break. The question on sales tax in my opinion is just common sense. We are buying at online rather than our local brick and mortar businesses. We need to decrease the local sales tax and increase the online sales tax.\INCOME TAX: We also need to go back to a fair income tax and get rid of the flat tax. Families deserve an income tax cut - especially in these times of crisis. My plan will solve the future concerns about tax restructuring without penalizing our education funding.\We have a higher proportion of our people of color being incarcerated, being infected with corona-virus and, yes, being killed. I have policies to address unconscious racism, mental health, suicide and homelessness. When I am in the Utah Senate, I will listen to the people. We must grow our way out of this pandemic.

I am fascinated by the idea of having hydrogen fuel cell and generating energy while producing water at the same time, especially since we live in a desert.\Being an advocate is a profession that was suggested to me when I said what I already was trying to do to speak up on behalf of others with unmet needs.\Affordability for both the constituent and the state. We could divide composing textbooks among those qualified already on public payroll, and so on.\The intent of the automation is for alleviating costs, delays, and shortages of professionals and services in such as in education, government, and medical.\Travis M.

I have experienced how the system works, both personally and professionally. I understand how the system benefits some, but not others and I feel the current legislature does not act in the best interest of its constituents.

238," To make sense of the chaos that is the Legislature, its leaders have come up with ""theme days.""\ About once a week during the 45-day session that begins Monday, lawmakers will focus on a package of bills clustered around a central subject. Featured themes are public education, gangs and crime, families, land and property rights, health care and military conversion.\ None of those overshadows the others, House Speaker Rob Bishop said Friday. ""If you want to give us a grade at the end of the session, grade us on all six.""\ But noticeable by its absence is ethics reform.\ ""I wouldn't say reforms are going to be the main issue or even one of the top 10 issues,"" said House Majority Leader Marty Stephens, R-Farr West.\ He said recent polls have shown residents do not rank such issues high, either. Yet it was Stephens who last May unveiled plans for a package of ""sunshine laws"" to polish up the public image of lawmakers.\ First among his proposals was opening the secret-but-powerful Rules Committee. The committee makes life-and-death decisions on legislation, but its debate and votes are not public.\ Stephens has backed off his plan to spring the lock on Rules.\ ""I don't see the demand for it and I'm not sure it's in the best interest of the state,"" he said, adding it actually could harm efficient screening of bills.\ Democrats say they will push a measure to open up Rules as well as closed-door party caucuses in the Legislature. But they are outnumbered 26-49 in the House and 11-18 in the Senate.\ Term limitation may have the best chance of passage. Bishop, R-Brigham City, said he will propose 12-year limits for state officials. He wants the same for Utah's congressional delegation, but only if other states follow suit.\ U.S. Rep. Karen Shepherd, D-Utah, said the most important reforms she sees in Congress and in the Legislature are disclosure of all lobbyist spending. The former state senator and advocate of congressional reform said: ""Citizens are filled with suspicion and distrust of government.""\ There also will be bills to tighten disclosure of lobbyist gift-giving to lawmakers. But the Senate has dug in against those -- and any reforms for that matter.\ Senate President Arnold Christensen, R-Sandy, said there is no need. ""I have not had any cases reported to me of misconduct by any senator,"" he said.\ Christensen said opening Rules would slow the flow of bills and argues tougher gift disclosure laws would accomplish nothing ""but put another big burden on the lobbyist.""\ Senate Minority Leader Scott Howell, D-Sandy, said the Republican majority will use the secret Rules Committee as its reform ""cemetery.""\ ""The tombstones that will be in there will be campaign reform, probably term limitation"" and lobbyist disclosure, Howell said. ""And they won't open Rules. They play too many games in there.""\ Here's a look at other items the 104 lawmakers will take up:\ Youth Issues: It should be a busy session for legislation that could affect the lives of Utah children.\ First, there is the behemoth Child Welfare Reform Act -- a complete overhaul of Utah's system to protect children from neglect and abuse. The controversial, 167-page bill -- inflated from its original 69 pages -- could pick up even more weight before the last gavel drops on March 2.\ But the bill may leave unanswered the issues raised by a class-action lawsuit brought against the state by San Francisco's National Center for Youth Law -- eventually demanding more legislation.\ Another youth bill comes from Rep. Dave Jones, D-Salt Lake, and is designed to protect youth in licensed child-care settings. His proposal would make it illegal for convicted child-abuse perpetrators or felons to be even indirectly involved with children in a licensed child-care or treatment center.\ Utah law already prohibits direct involvement of convicted abusers with children in licensed settings.\ Uniform Safety: Among the most publicized bills is the school uniform proposal of Sen. Howard Stephenson, R-Draper.\ The idea is to slow youth crime by taking away ""colors"" from gang members. The measure is expected to sail through the House and Senate with no resistance. School boards are already authorized to approve uniforms, but this bill adds legislative blessing.\ Another shot at youth crime is a proposal to confiscate weapons on school grounds, penalize the parents of children who brought those weapons to school and special criminal penalties for students who assault school personnel.\ But probably the most anticipated legislation surrounds school fees. Laurie Chivers, deputy superintendent for the state Office of Education, expects the school fees issue to be tabled for yet another year, although Rep. Nancy Lyon, R-Bountiful, will attempt to push a bill through that eliminates textbook fees.\ In the technology arena, Sen. David Steele, R-West Point, also is seeking to allow schools to spend up to 25% of their appropriation of Educational Technology Initiative funds for training teachers.\ But the Utah Education Association likely will fight a proposal that calls for taking a portion of teacher Career Ladder pay and putting it toward in-depth teacher training.\ Higher Education: As one higher education official puts it, ""This is a good year to be asking for money."" The Utah System of Higher Education is proposing a $571 million budget, with $411 million coming from state tax funds, for the state's nine public colleges and universities.\ That's nearly $50 million more than last year's system budget, but it's not far from the governor's recommendation for higher education. In his proposed state spending plan, Gov. Mike Leavitt offers $549 million for colleges and universities, with $393 million coming from taxes.\ Health-Care Reform: While Leavitt's closely guarded plans for health-care reform may be the most talked about health legislation, other bills could directly affect more people.\ A coalition of groups will push for Utah's seat-belt law to become primary, allowing law officers to pull over drivers suspected of not using restraints. Under the existing secondary law, offending drivers can be cited only if they are stopped for another traffic violation. A 1993 survey of seat-belt use shows only 50% of adults buckle up. Only slightly more children -- 56% -- are properly restrained.\ While debate over the bill probably will focus on individual freedom, supporters plan to lobby for the change on the strength of evidence about the staggering cost of automobile accidents.\ The right to choose is also destined to rise when lawmakers debate smoking and the Utah Indoor Clean Air Act. More than a dozen legislators have signed on as sponsors of a bill that would ban smoking in all buildings frequented by the public. That would include restaurants, taverns, malls and stores.\ A similar proposal considered by the Salt Lake City-County Board of Health in 1993 was rejected, partly because county business owners argued the measure would place them at a disadvantage with surrounding counties.\ As for health-care reform in Utah, few details have emerged. Leavitt is expected to ask legislators to create a Health Policy Commission to coordinate policy through the year 2000. He also intends to add 34,000 people to Medicaid, a federal/state health-care program for low-income people.\ The business community is anxious about reform, mostly because employers worry how heavy the cost burden will be.\ ""There has not been lots of information about the governor's program,"" said Lee J. Peacock, a lobbyist for the 2,300-member Salt Lake Area Chamber of Commerce. ""The cost of providing insurance to employees is staggering, and that is a major concern to employers.""\ Businesses hope the governor's proposal does not include the same types of employer mandates being considered under the Clinton administration plan.\ Economic Health: Hearty growth has Utah businesses bullish on the upcoming legislative session.\ ""With such a large budget surplus this year, we obviously want to see things keep going the way they have been going,"" says Peacock, the Chamber of Commerce lobbyist. ""Hopefully, we will steer clear of any major fights.""\ The most likely battleground, if there is one, will be tax reform, particularly sales-tax exemptions. Industry groups are geared to oppose any effort to scale back existing exemptions, such as one for pollution-control devices and shipping in-state freight.\ The governor is expected to announce his own plans for exemptions during the session's first week. He has committed to paring those exemptions by $4.2 million next year so money can be freed for urgent school building needs.\ Another possible source of friction will be workers' compensation reform. The Employers Reinsurance Fund has an unfunded liability of $285 million, a figure estimated to hit $3 billion in 40 years as more permanently disabled workers depend on it.\ A governor's task force has suggested a catch-up program for the reinsurance fund, plus shifting future liabilities for permanently disabled workers to the insurers. Employers are bound to be skittish because they aren't sure whether the changes mean rates will go up.\ Businesses already are applauding signs that lawmakers intend to put more money into loan and capital programs.\ The Utah Technology Finance Corp., which has requested $3 million for its start-up capital programs for next year, is likely to get at least some of the increase. The governor has suggested boosting funding from 1993's $1.4 million to $2.2 million.\ The publicly funded private agency channels money into cash-hungry start-up businesses, and many economic development officials think the time is right to inject even more funding into this program as a way to buffer the state against any economic hardships that might be on the horizon.\ Unfunded Mandates: Utah League of Cities and Towns represents all 228 of the state's cities and towns.\ About half of the bills and resolutions introduced in the Legislature affect cities, said the league's lobbyist, David Spatafore. Any of those bills that mandate new programs and don't come with state funding will be vigorously opposed.\ Mayors dislike the mandates because taxes often must be raised to pay for them.\ The league will support a bill calling for an audit of the state Tax Commission. The commission is allowed to keep 2 1/2% of the local option tax it collects, but may have been keeping more, Spatafore said.\ Another bill the league likes would raise the amount cities can keep in gas tax. Cities currently get about 25% of the tax and want at least 30%.\ City and County Issues: Salt Lake City officials will be trying to revive development in the downtown area west of City Hall by pushing for state funding of a $69 million courts complex.\ ""It would be important to the city, but would save the state a lot of money by having one big courts building rather than a lot of small ones,"" said Deputy Salt Lake City Mayor Brian Hatch. One study claims the complex would save the state more than $100 million over the next 30 years. Much of the $69 million price tag could be paid by raising court fees.\ Salt Lake County's legislative priority is to get reimbursement from the state for prisoners held in county jails. Last year, the Legislature approved a plan to pay local governments for jail cell use, but appropriated few dollars. The governor's new budget calls for $2.6 million -- and Salt Lake County could expect almost half of that.\ Corrections: With legislative attention on the juvenile justice system, the Utah Department of Corrections is focusing on parolees.\ Rep. R. Lee Ellertson, R-Orem, is sponsoring legislation that would make it a third-degree felony -- punishable by up to five years in prison -- to leave a halfway house without permission.\ The bill comes on the heels of the disappearance of parolee Joe Delaney last fall from Salt Lake City. He was arrested in Arizona in December for murder.\ ""All we could do here was charge him with a misdemeanor for walking away,"" Ellertson said. ""We need something with more teeth.""\ With the growing concern about crime in Utah, Corrections deputy director Nick Morgan believes the bill will go through the House of Representatives and Senate with little opposition.\ Rep. Dave Jones wants to make it easier for people acquitted of crimes to expunge their arrest records.\ His bill was prompted after a West Valley City man was wrongly accused of rape last summer. After he was released and tried to get a job, he ran into difficulties because of the charge on his record. And, court officials told him he had to pay to get the charge expunged.\ ""That was wrong,"" Jones said. ""He should have had that charge expunged immediately.""\ The bill would allow someone to ask for an expungement order immediately after they are pronounced not guilty in court, he said.\ The Environment: If the Legislature adopts the Department of Natural Resources budget proposal offered by analyst Stan Eckersley, it will rob wildlife programs to pay for new state park facilities.\ Eckersley proposes slashing $519,500 in general funds from the governor's proposed Division of Wildlife Resources budget. Most would be used to fund a visitor center at Antelope Island State Park, a remodeling project at Anasazi State Park and trail and riverway development throughout Utah.\ Department of Natural Resources executive director Ted Stewart is prepared to battle the analyst. He said the governor's top priority in natural resources is to gain more general funds for wildlife.\ The financially strapped Division of Wildlife Resources -- which has seen $1.3 million in general funds slashed from its budget the past two years -- is in the process of laying off 28 full-time employees. The agency is now 99.5% funded by hunting and fishing license and equipment sales, a process hurt by a poor deer hunting year.\ Measures to help reduce air pollution along the Wasatch Front are the top priority of the Utah Department of Environmental Quality.\ Legislative authorization is being sought to allow the state, if necessary, to toughen vehicle emission inspections. People no longer would be able to go to neighborhood gas stations for inspections, but would have to go to a centralized facility with higher quality inspection equipment.\ Military Affairs: Reps. Blake Chard, R-Layton, and Assistant Minority Whip Grant Protzman, D-North Ogden, are pushing two measures designed to cushion defense cutbacks and bolster Hill Air Force Base for the 1995 base closure round.\ Chard is sponsoring a bill seeking $10 million, as requested by the governor, for easements to prevent commercial and residential development below Hill flight paths. Community encroachment was a consideration in Pentagon studies for the 1993 closure process, and officials want to keep the issue from working against Hill in the upcoming round.\ Easements would prevent private property owners from putting major developments on the land, but would allow for other uses such as a golf course or light manufacturing.\ All but $500,000 of the $10 million would come from bonding, and the full amount may not be required, Chard said.\ Protzman, who sponsored legislation last year allocating $1 million for defense conversion purposes, will have a measure this year seeking $1.5 million.\ The only pre-filed legislation pertaining to veterans is a bill sponsored by Rep. Gene Davis, D-Salt Lake, that would make changes in property tax exemptions for disabled veterans. Davis' proposal would exempt every disabled veteran based on the percentage of his or her disability and would remove all income eligibility requirements."
239,"Tax cuts and morality issues grabbed the most headlines during the 45-day legislative session, but lawmakers applied themselves to a variety of endeavors.\WELFARE REFORM\Helping single parents gain self-sufficiency is the focus of Utah's new welfare-reform legislation. But a decrease in funding and the fates of several companion bills could detract from the plan's success.\After months of discussion, revision and collaboration, House Bill 293 -- Employment Assistance for Utah Families -- surfaced as almost a mirror image of the state's highly touted two-year-old Single Parent Employment Demonstration (SPED) project.\The major differences in the new bill are 24-month time limits for education and training and a 36-month limit in family participation, although the bill allows for exceptions in both. The SPED project, implemented by the Office of Family Support (OFS) in select areas, has no time limits.\The legislative fiscal analyst recommended a $1.6 million decrease in funding because welfare caseloads have been decreasing. The agency hoped to maintain the budget at the current level and reinvest the savings from decreased caseloads into making the statewide transition to SPED by July 1.\Now that timeline may have to be moved to July 1, 1997, unless the state's strong economy continues to markedly decrease the number of new cases.\And there were no cost-of-living adjustments in the benefits, prompting low-income advocates to say the benefits just are not enough for a family to get by.\Also detracting from the welfare plan was the failure of two child-support bills, and the decreased efficacy of another bill that did finally pass.\House Bill 298, which would have allowed for the suspension of professional licenses for nonpayment of child support, was defeated in the House. And House Bill 299, which would have required employers to report new hires to the Industrial Commission for comparison with child-support delinquency lists, died in the Senate.\Suspension of a driver license for negligent non-payment of child support passed, but not before being amended to have the courts do administrative reviews instead of the Office of Recovery Services.\Overall, the state's Department of Human Services was treated well.\Its Division of Family Services will see $9.2 million in new funding for foster care and for the additional staff needed to comply with the Child Welfare Reform Act enacted two years ago.\The Division of Services for People with Disabilities saw a record year in funding, with $3.3 million to boost programs that traditionally have had long waiting lists.\Aging and Adult Services likewise received additional funding for in-home services, home-delivered meals and staff increases in adult protective services, where referrals have increased 20% over the past year.\-- Nancy Hobbs\PUBLIC SCHOOLS\Education finally began to see dividends of Utah's recent economic boom as Utah schools received their largest increase in state funding ever. In all, public education received more than $190 million in new and one-time funds, an 11% increase over last year.\The amount the state spends per pupil will increase by $67 to $1,739. That could move Utah ahead of Mississippi at the bottom of the nation's per-pupil spending.\Lawmakers also approved $30 million to reduce elementary class sizes. Districts can use a portion of the money to hire new teachers or aides, while growing districts can use some of the money to build new school buildings.\Schools will get $10 million to purchase textbooks, supplies or to provide teachers with classroom telephones, and Utah's nearly 20,000 teachers get $3 million to purchase supplies for their classrooms.\School libraries get $4.5 million to improve inventory of computer and audio visual supplies. With an extra $1.4 million, another 15 highly impacted schools will get extra help to meet the special language and social needs of low-income and minority students.\Non-English speaking students received an additional $2 million to help them learn the language and succeed in school, and a $2 million allotment will fund a pilot program in selected schools that allows junior and high school students to choose which of five semesters to attend in a school year.\-- Katherine Kapos and Hilary Groutage\HIGHER EDUCATION\Lawmakers gave Utah's nine public colleges and universities a nearly 10% boost in funding, yet higher education Commissioner Cecelia Foxley is calling the 51st Legislature ``the worst session in anyone's recall.''\For higher education officials, the devil is in the budget details. Lawmakers appropriated $625 million to the Utah System of Higher Education, but $39 million of that is Uniform School Fund money.\So, while public colleges and universities saw an increase in funding, they cannot spend it until voters and possibly the courts rule on expanding use of the Uniform School Fund.\Lawmakers passed a referendum putting the issue on the ballot, and voters will decide in November whether public education should share the fund with higher education. But a ``friendly lawsuit'' on the issue could still be filed depending on the outcome of that referendum.\Either way, colleges and universities cannot spend that part of their appropriation until halfway through the fiscal year -- if even then.\Further complicating matters is the large amount of one-time funding going to ongoing programs. For example, the University of Utah received one-time funds to hire staff for the expanded Marriott Library, but the school has no assurance that funding will be continued next year.\For students, as well, the legislative appropriation contains good news and bad news. For the first time in two decades, they will not face a tuition increase. But historically, funding from tuition increases has gone to ``urgent student support,'' which includes such things as library acquisitions and academic counseling. Lawmakers did not compensate for the loss of that funding, so students will go without some of that support next year.\-- Joan O'Brien\TRANSPORTATION\Utah's new plan for transportation is big, bold and expensive: $2.5 billion over the next 10 years, including a fast-track expansion and repair of I-15 through Salt Lake County.\Lawmakers anted up $110 million in cash to get the project off to a speedy start, and pledged commitment to a future yearly investment of at least $75 million.\But the program has one flaw deeper than the worst pothole: No reliable source of funding. Analysts have projected a $1.2 billion shortfall through the life of the project with known revenue sources.\The probable source is borrowing through bonds and an increased fuel tax. In fact, a gas-tax increase tied to inflation and with a delayed implementation date was part of the plan that emerged from Gov. Mike Leavitt's growth summit in December.\But the legislative session was sanitized of any fuel-tax talk even before it began, with a wary political eye cocked on November's election for Leavitt, all House members and half the state Senate.\Expect the issue to resurface after the election.\Motorists frustrated with left-lane-hugging semi-trucks and dump trucks shedding gravel got some attention from lawmakers for a change.\The trucking industry is a powerful lobby on Capitol Hill and seldom loses, but it accepted a compromise on a windshield-protection law that is headed to the governor.\Under the bill, trucks must cover loads of sand, gravel and other materials if they exceed the height of the truckbed walls. But the compromise exempts coal, construction debris and scrap metal that is ``not susceptible to being blown out of a vehicle.''\Geneva Steel also won a tailor-made loophole that allows it to transport uncovered loads across a state highway bisecting its property.\-- Dan Harrie\CHILDREN\For the second year running, legislation written to close a dangerous loophole in child-care licensing fell victim to the session's annual last-day rush.\Despite efforts by child advocates to mediate concerns and insure funding was available for Day Care Licensing Amendments, House Bill 125, it died after several stagnant hours on the Senate board. It would have required ``drop-in'' centers that provide child care for four hours or less to comply with minimum health and safety licensing standards.\Those businesses currently are exempt from the law, and that oversight is blamed, in part, for the 1994 death of a toddler who wandered away from an unsecured center and fell into a canal.\A school breakfast bill, House Bill 236, did pass in the last hours, but not before being lambasted by a Republican senator as infringing on the responsibilities of parents. The bill requires elementary schools to review, every two years, why they don't participate in the school breakfast program, and to begin participating if there aren't valid reasons.\Children will be beneficiaries of a bill creating a one-year pilot project on enforcement of visitation orders after divorce. The project will rely on mediators instead of attorneys to assist parents in ironing out disagreements.\Adoption was the subject of several successful bills. An ``adoption assistance'' bill will provide 15 months of financial assistance to pregnant women who choose to offer their newborns for adoption. Another bill increases the amount of adoption-related expenses that adoptive parents can deduct from income taxes.\Housecleaning measures were addressed in 71 pages of amendments to the Child Welfare Reform Act of 1994, with a name change being most notable. With the governor's signature, the agency becomes the Division of Child and Family Services.\-- Nancy Hobbs\SPEED\For many, speed will be what heads the 1996 Utah Legislature's entry on the pages of history.\Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to hike the maximum speed limit on state freeways to 75 miles an hour.\The higher cap came against the wishes of some lawmakers who cautioned it would worsen air pollution and increase traffic deaths -- a claim supported by volumes of safety studies. Supporters, many of them frustrated by facing Utah's long rural stretches, were undaunted.\Gov. Mike Leavitt balked at proposals to push the speed limit even higher, but hinted he could sign a 75 mph limit into law.\Increased speed limits will be up to the discretion of the Utah Department of Transportation, depending on highway design, traffic loads and other factors. Highway experts say speeds won't rise overnight, but they already have a few long, straight stretches in mind.\Drivers in some urban areas will be less bound by enforcement of speed limits as well. After one of the longest roller-coaster rides of the session, lawmakers finally voted to restrict photo radar systems to school zones and residential areas of 30 mph or under. Critics of the systems, which snap pictures of speeders and send tickets by mail, said they violated the constitutional right to confront one's accuser.\Officials in Layton, West Valley City and Sandy, where the system is used, said the new restrictions will make it impossible to raise enough revenues to cover basic costs of the system -- potentially shutting it down in Utah altogether.\-- Tony Semerad\HEALTH CARE\Gov. Mike Leavitt's seven-year reform policy known as HealthPrint survived a threat to a key component of insurance reform, open enrollment. A bill that provides for the publication of report cards on Utah insurance companies also passed.\Senate Bill 174 would have shrunk the number of employers eligible to enroll in open enrollment, a Jan. 1 program that requires insurance companies to offer coverage to employees of small businesses who have been denied insurance because of poor health conditions. The sponsor agreed to hold the bill for a year to give the governor's Health Policy Commission a chance to study the issue.\Another insurance-related law, Senate Bill 171, clears the way for the Department of Health to begin publishing reports comparing Utah HMOs, managed-care firms and other insurance companies to help consumers decide which health plan to pick.\Other legislation by the Health Policy Commission affords a victory to rural doctors and hospitals who have been cut out of the state's expanding HMO network. House Bill 146 allows patients in 22 counties under 30,000 people to choose a nearby physician or hospital not included in their health plans. Those providers will then be reimbursed by the HMO under the same terms extended to participating providers. Backers and opponents of the bill agreed to delay its implementation date until July 1, 1997, to assess its impacts on the health-care market.\And House Bill 129 forbids legislators from raiding the $1 million to $2 million the state saves each year by shifting more Medicaid patients into HMOs. Instead of dumping those savings back into the general fund, legislators agreed to deposit them in a separate account and use the money to expand Medicaid coverage for Utah's needy residents.\Also successful was House Bill 273, which allows small employers to band together in purchasing alliances to buy health insurance for their employees. They traditionally have been unable to afford insurance coverage while watching larger employers enjoy lower health-insurance costs.\Legislators also approved $350,000 for community health centers to treat an additional 1,700 medically underserved patients during 1996.\-- Norma Wagner\1996 Utah Legislative Summary\TAXES: With the exception of cigarette smokers, most Utahns will be paying a little less tax on their incomes and property. Proposals to shift cities' taxing authority failed to gel before the session ended.\PUBLIC SCHOOLS: Utah's public school system will put $30 million toward reducing Utah class sizes, currently the largest in the nation, but educators are still smarting over legislators' claims that they encourage homosexuality.\HIGHER EDUCATION: The good news is public colleges and universities will see an increase in funding; the bad news is they can't spend it until voters and possibly the courts rule on expanding use of the Uniform School Fund.\SPEED: The Utah Department of Transportation receives permission to raise freeway speed limits to 75 mph, and automatic, photo-radar speed traps are severely restricted.\ROADS: The state gets the go-ahead to rebuild Interstate 15 through the Salt Lake Valley under an accelerated schedule, but election-year jitters kept legislators from finding another $1.2 billion to pay for it. They did commit $110 million to road projects.\HEALTH CARE: The state will begin issuing ``report cards'' on the various health-insurance plans in Utah. Rural Utahns can go to doctors closer to home and still be covered by their insurance.\COMMUNITIES: Unincorporated areas can form ``townships'' to protect themselves from encroaching cities with aggressive annexation policies. Redevelopment agencies, under which cities grant tax breaks to encourage development, survived an attempt to restrict them out of existence.\WELFARE: Utah turns its experimental work-based welfare program into statewide policy. The program requires participants to spend some time working or training for a job and puts time limits on how long a family can receive benefits.\UTILITIES: Lawmakers hang up US WEST's request to loosen price curbs as would-be competitors accuse the company of trying to lock up the local-phone marketplace.\LABOR: Republican Gov. Mike Leavitt wins lawmakers' support for his 16-month-long reorganization of the state's job and workplace programs.\CRIME: The state Corrections system gets 336 new inmate beds, and another juvenile-court judge will be added in eastern Utah. Sex offenders no longer face minimum-mandatory sentences, with the state pardons board given more control over their fates.\ABORTION: A controversial but rare late-term abortion technique is outlawed, and doctors will be required to give women seeking an abortion a state-produced video that includes ultrasound pictures of developing fetuses.\HOUSING: Those who are getting squeezed out of affordable housing got only token relief when a housing trust fund received half the $6 million initially targeted.\ENVIRONMENT: Water districts are now allowed to issue revenue bonds without voter approval, although elections must be held if 5% of voters request one. Protection of open space, considered a key issue by Leavitt last fall, received only token attention."

\
SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah has one of the worst air pollution problems in the country and the impacts are startling: The pollution is killing people.
\
It is sending families and individuals to hospital emergency rooms. It is contributing to strokes and heart attacks. Both young and old suffer asthma at greater rates in dirty air areas, and those with respiratory diseases are left wheezing and coughing, fighting a tightening in their lungs.
\
Business interests, often cited as a check against strict air quality standards, can actually feel the brunt of pollution as an economy slayer, as green businesses are chased away and local businesses lose out on potential employees and their families who don't want to live under the smothering canopy of a wintertime inversion or endure the blanket of stifling summer ozone.
\
Within the past four years, several counties in Utah became reluctant members of the dirty air club, taking their spots among the worst of the worst in the country when it comes to air quality and short-term pollution. On average, state air quality regulators insist that Utah's air quality is far from the worst, but when it does get bad, it's very bad.
\
On those days, the filthy air of highly populated areas like metropolitan New York City or Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area is surpassed on the Wasatch Front, as demonstrated in 2010 when the northern part of the state was locked in the grips of an unrelenting inversion and the EPA said the air here was the most polluted in the country.
\
Health studies during the past two decades have demonstrated the link between exposure to air pollutants and dangerous consequences to health. Utah County, in fact, was an early test tube of the correlation, where a Brigham Young University professor studied the link between a steel mill closure, improvement in children's respiratory health, and subsequent higher hospitalization rates -- a doubling -- when the mill re-opened. That research by Arden Pope would later go on to lay the foundation for the federal agency's air quality standards in the 1990s.
\
Three national studies earlier this year have brought greater urgency to the problem, revealing that even short-term exposure to levels of pollution considered ""safe"" by federal standards bring immediate risks of heart attack and stroke.
\
With Utah fast approaching a deadline to submit a plan to come into federal compliance, a disturbing reality has emerged: Even making the standard will not bring clean air to Utah, and it will continue to reach into nearly every aspect of daily life.
\
It leaves Utahns with a tough choice. Find the motivation to make sweeping changes, or acknowledge the cost and live with the consequences of breathing dirty air.
\
""There is no single silver bullet that will solve the problem,"" Bryce Bird, Utah's director of air quality, said.
\
""Everything we do as a society contributes to our air pollutionproblem -- heating our homes, heating our hot water, hair spray,deodorant; the driving component is very large. Each car, taken alone,is small. But all together they are a large part of the problem.""
\
The price of inaction is high:
\
- A 10-year study in the Boston area that followed nearly 20,000 women ages 70 to 81 found that those who breathed in dirtier air longer had a two-year head start in the decline of mental acuity, zapping the ability to carry out a plan or make a strategy.
\
- Air pollution has been linked to extended bouts of depression, and the National Institute of Health reports that increased levels of some air pollutants are accompanied by an increase in psychiatric admissions and emergency calls.
\
- Americans are suffering from asthma in record numbers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with nearly one in 10 children and one in 12 adults afflicted. In areas of Utah where air quality is the poorest, there are higher hospitalization rates for those suffering asthma. In North Salt Lake and Woods Cross -- home to a cluster of refineries -- 16 percent of children have asthma, a rate more than triple the statewide average of 5 percent, according to Utah health department statistics.
\
An estimated 65,000 children in Utah suffer from asthma, according to the health department, and a recent analysis it conducted in tandem with the National Weather Service shows that the longer a wintertime inversion lasts, the higher likelihood exists that it will result in a trip to a hospital emergency room for asthma sufferers.
\
- A group of Utah physicians said the unhealthy air is a crisis that kills as many as 2,000 people along the Wasatch Front each year, and shaves two years off of a person's life.
\
Utah's air quality regulators are up against a Dec. 14 deadline to submit their plan to the federal government on reducing the tiniest particles of air pollution, or PM2.5. A draft is expected to be presented to the air quality board members next month.
\
Three areas in Utah that are ""non-attainment"" for compliance with federal clean air standards are among 32 in the country that have not been able to bring fine particulate pollution under control.
\
Within those three areas are the valley portion of Utah County, all of Salt Lake and Davis counties, the valley portion of Weber County, the eastern edge of Tooele County, the southeastern portion of Box Elder County and the valley portion of Cache County.
\
To come into compliance and meet with EPA's approval, an entire suite of changes to pollutant-emitting sources is being contemplated in the impacted areas, and Utah regulators stress that everything is a target.
\
""Nothing is off the table, and it is a big table,"" said Dave McNeill, manager of the Division of Air Quality's Planning Branch.
\
Clearing the air
\
So what would it take to clear the dirty air along the Wasatch Front?
\
The mountains and the Great Salt Lake are two big topographical players in a minuet that helps to foster the air pollution problem.
\
""There are plenty of locations around the world that have unhealthy wintertime inversions, but the severity that we have is worsened because of the surrounding terrain,"" said John Horel, an atmospheric science professor at the University of Utah.
\
He and the university's David Whiteman have been coordinating the state's largest field study in more than a decade probing Utah's winter inversions and the atmospheric factors that come into play.
\
""What can happen is at certain times you can get enough flow that it can push some of the pollution over the Great Salt Lake, and then it comes sloshing back,"" Horel said. ""We are not in a teacup, but we are certainly affected by the mountains. ... We are in a tough situation. The deck is kind of stacked against us.""
\
Utah's air quality regulators can't very well bulldoze the mountains or drain the Great Salt Lake, so those two environmental components shaping pollution patterns will remain constant companions. That puts more pressure on the need to eliminate other problems. And the biggest problem flows from the tailpipes of trucks and cars, which are estimated to cause 55 percent of the pollution fueling wintertime inversions along the Wasatch Front.
\
To get rid of that component of air pollution, it would mean eliminating the more than 459,000 trucks, cars and motorcycles that travel daily on I-15 through Utah, Salt Lake, Davis and Weber counties.
\
Those numbers, from 2011, are annual counts of traffic compiled by the Utah Department of Transportation and show that despite gains in public use of mass transit, Wasatch Front residents by and large don't want to give up their cars.
\
One Tooele County resident who is involved in a state working group crafting ways to curb pollution put it this way:
\
""They all agreed it would be a good idea to drive less, and no one does it.""
\
The Utah Transit Authority does put a dent in the number of cars on the road. An estimated 6,000 people ride the FrontRunner commuter line a day -- that's potentially 6,000 fewer vehicles on the road. UTA spokesman Gerry Carpenter said when FrontRunner extends into Utah County by December of this year another 6,800 people are anticipated to ride each day.
\
On an average weekday basis, 55,000 to 60,000 people ride TRAX, and UTA's van pool program under Rideshare has 400 vans that each ferry anywhere from five to 15 people for an average of 131,782 trips a month, Carpenter said.
\
""The long-term solution is to get more people out of their cars and get away from the single driver on the road,"" Carpenter said.
\
But that ""solution"" has been part of public discourse for decades, throughout the nation. To really solve the problem means overcoming two key obstacles: cost and inconvenience.
\
A transit solution
\
Public transit fares in Utah are among the highest in the country and could be reduced to be more affordable and increase ridership.
\
Carpenter said those fees are in the higher bracket because UTA has more people taking longer trips and the service area is 1,600 square miles, driving operational costs higher.
\
Each year, however, the suggestion is made for UTA to reduce fares or temporarily eliminate them altogether on those ""bad air"" days.
\
Such a move would result in a daily revenue loss of between $113,000 and $130,000 -- an amount Carpenter said is not sustainable by the agency unless Utah lawmakers make up the rest.
\
Dr. Brian Moench, head of Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment, said there needs to be a policy shift.
\
""We must stop spending so much money on road building and be willing to divert some of the Utah Department of Transportation's enormous budget to expand and subsidize a mass transit system that is extensive enough that it provides people with a viable alternative to using their cars. It would take a constitutional amendment to divert some of the gas tax to mass transit.""
\
Access to timely, affordable transit is a pressing problem for many along the spread-out, meandering corridor of the Wasatch Front that is encapsulated by mountains on one side and the Great Salt Lake on the other.
\
The nearest UTA bus stop is a little more than three miles from Joe Murphy's home in Weber County's Farr West and while he's ridden FrontRunner a few times to get to Salt Lake City, it is not because it is more convenient or less expensive than driving his car.
\
""Right now, FrontRunner is a novelty to me, because you are not saving any time.""
\
Murphy said if he were to take public transportation to get to work at Hill Air Force Base, it would take him two hours and 20 minutes to go 17 miles.
\
To go to dinner in Salt Lake City or take in a Utah Jazz game, it costs him $20.40 for him and his wife, Brandy, to ride FrontRunner.
\
""I can drive it cheaper than that,"" he said.
\
About 105 employers provide transit passes to workers, but that is not helpful if the workplace is still miles away. Much like hotels offer shuttles, Murphy wonders if the UTA could offer specialized shuttle services to make up where bus routes end, but Carpenter said Homeland Security prevents a public route from entering the base. Employers and the UTA, clean air advocates insist, could do more to provide comprehensive shuttle services to transport people in larger numbers.
\
Turning over the fleet
\
Transportation planners with the Wasatch Front Regional Council and the state Division of Air Quality say even as new cars become cleaner-burning and more fuel-efficient, too many older, exhaust-spewing vehicles remain on the road -- chief among them dirty diesel engines.
\
""They only represent 7 percent of the fleet, but are 40 percent of the nitrous oxide problem,"" said Kip Billings, traffic engineer with the Wasatch Front Regional Council.
\
Moench agrees.
\
""An older diesel engine creates 100 times more pollution per horsepower generated than a gasoline engine,"" he said. ""The more diesel engines we can get off the road or upgrade to the new generation cleaner engines (Tier 4) the better.""
\
Utah's Clean School Bus Project retrofitted 1,204 school buses throughout the state to lessen pollution, and replaced 27 older buses with new buses that meet more stringent emissions standards.
\
Three truck stop electrification spots in Salt Lake City, Perry and in Wendover on the Nevada/Utah border provide power hookups so big rigs' engines don't have to idle, and also save on the consumption of fuel.
\
Truckers can also opt for the installation of auxiliary power units on their long-haul trucks, but such technology is expensive and federal grants are competitive.
\
Industry as polluter
\
Beyond the cars, the trucks and fuel-efficient but pollution-emitting motorcycles, industry is a primary contributor to pollution and most often is the target of clean air advocates.
\
Utah's air quality regulators say industry represents 20 percent of the wintertime gas emissions on a typical day in the Salt Lake area -- and Rio Tinto's Kennecott Utah Copper, Moench said, is 30 percent of Salt Lake County's air pollution problem -- a figure disputed by the company.
\
Several groups have filed a lawsuit against the mining giant to stop its expansion plans, an expansion that Rio Tinto asserts would actually decrease its overall contribution to emissions.
\
If Rio Tinto's mining enterprise weren't here, it would mean it wasn't contributing to the air pollution problem. But it would also mean a $1.2 billion economic powerhouse goes away, as well as the supply of nearly 25 percent of the nation's copper, 2,810 jobs and an annual payroll of $253 million, according to the University of Utah's Bureau of Economic and Business Research.
\
Its critics say the company makes enough money that it can afford to clean up by retiring all of its coal-fired plants and converting to natural gas or renewables and by changing its diesel fleet to the cleanest engines possible.
\
Kennecott is planning to replace three of its coal-fired boilers with one larger turbine and boiler powered by natural gas, but is keeping one boiler powered by coal for ""power generation diversity,"" said spokesman Kyle Bennett. The coal-fired plant does not operate in the wintertime when pollution can be at its worst along the Wasatch Front.
\
Bennett said the company spent $1 billion to upgrade its smelter to make it among the cleanest in the country, using technology that shaved its sulfur emissions by 99 percent. It also has plans to upgrade its fleet to newer, larger more fuel-efficient engines.
\
Still, company officials acknowledge they are ""absolutely not"" comfortable with the levels of pollution caused by the mining operation.
\
""It's not acceptable to us and we are constantly working to reduce that,"" said spokesman Justin Jones. ""We recognize it, we own it and we need to move forward in reducing it.""
\
Rio Tinto and several refineries along the Wasatch Front have plans for expansions -- plans endorsed by Utah regulators -- that critics like Moench say should be shelved until Utah has done more to clean up its dirty air. It's not enough, they say, for industry to be under the ""cap"" when the cap is too high.
\
As the state crafts a pollution plan it hopes will pass federal muster, it's likely additional emission controls will be hoisted upon industry, including Kennecott, refineries and even mid-sized bakeries, auto body shops and paving companies.
\
Those smaller businesses, such as printing enterprises and dry cleaners, represent the fastest growing segment of polluters along the Wasatch Front, McNeill said.
\
""Those sources are all growing with the population and they are growing uncontrolled,"" McNeill said. ""By 2019, area sources will be are largest polluter, emitting three times more than all of industry combined.""
\
Any of those improvements that have to be made to curtail emissions will cost money, likely passed on in higher costs in products and services, and will take years to implement.
\
McNeill and Bird say fixing Utah's air quality is a complex chemical problem not unlike a shooting gallery at a traveling carnival. Take a shot at one moving target -- a certain type of pollution -- and reductions in that category can make another classification of pollutants grow worse.
\
""The target we have is a difficult target,"" Bird said, ""and we will continue to be in non-compliance well into the next few years. It could be well up until 2019 until we achieve the standard.""
\
The Environmental Protection Agency proposed lowering the standard for PM2.5 even more, a move clean air advocates said is long overdue.
\
""There is no safe level of pollution,"" Moench said. ""What needs to be done is draw a line in the sand, in this case 'in the air' whereby every segment constantly lowers its emissions so that the net effect is as close to zero emissions as we can get.""
\
Sacrifices
\
Curbing pollution has become a problem stretching beyond industry and now resting at the door of each Utah resident. And facing the costs and inconveniences will not hit everyone equally.
\
Cache County residents who have not had to contemplate annual emissions inspections on their vehicles will see that change. So could Tooele and Box Elder counties.
\
The simple act of igniting a pilot light on a water heater will become more rare as those appliances are phased out, and simply prohibited, under a new rule being pondered.
\
On chilly winter nights, the pleasure of a cozy fire may be a thing of the past as new construction could forbid fireplaces or wood-burning stoves in homes, or the state air quality division calls ""no burn"" days earlier to try to stave off inversions.
\
Those pushing for change say cleaning the air must become more than just the job of some people, some industries, and more than just a voluntary act.
\
""It's going to take everything,"" said Sam Klemm, with the Wasatch Front Regional Council. Political will, money and sacrifice.
\
""Any bit of pollution you can get out of the air, we all benefit from it,"" Moench said. ""Having a 'safe' level of pollution is a concept that is no longer valid.""

241,"For Barry Goldwater Jr., a clean energy economy is arriving in the form of efficient, low-cost photovoltaics and utilities who fail to embrace this innovation risk ""getting run over by the future.""\But the former Republican California congressman contends Rocky Mountain Power and other utilities are flexing their monopoly power to stifle the expansion of rooftop solar to preserve an outdated business model.\""If you tax something, you're going to have less of it,"" Goldwater said at a rally Tuesday denouncing RMP's proposal to impose a $4.65 monthly fee on ""net metered"" customers who cover part of their power needs with solar arrays. ""No one owns the sun and to put a tax on it is wrong.""\Goldwater now chairs a free-market group call TUSK, or Tell Utilities Solar Won't be Killed, that is joining clean-energy advocates around the country to fight proposed fees on net-metered ratepayers. Arizona is the only state to have authorized such a fee, but Utah may soon follow.\""Solar choice means competition. Competition drives down prices and drives up quality,"" Goldwater said.\About 200 residents joined Goldwater outside the Salt Lake City headquarters of the Utah Public Service Commission before pouring into the Heber Wells building to address the three-member panel that regulates utilities. Critics say the fee would help keep RMP hooked on coal by discouraging personal investment in renewable energy.\""We should not allow solar to be stomped out of the marketplace just as it is gaining momentum,"" said Salt Lake City resident Jared Campbell, whose 8.5-kilowatt PV system produces more energy than his home consumes. He is incensed the state would allow penalizing citizens who tap an energy source that is free, last forever and doesn't pollute.\This week, the PSC has been hearing diametrically opposed versions of net-metered customers' impact on Rocky Mountain Power and its 700,000 residential customers.\In the version advanced by the company, current rate structures end up subsidizing solar-equipped customers because they no longer pay their fair share of the utility's substantial investment in power distribution and transmission and peak generating capacity.\RMP engineer Douglas Marx said solar power production peaks too early in the day to help offset summer peak power demand between 4 and 7 p.m. And the intermittent nature of distributed solar generation, due to the movement of the sun and clouds, can trigger voltage fluctuations that stress infrastructure.\Fixed operational costs account for 60 percent of the utility's expenses, which are covered by retail rates.\Solar-powered customers, who still rely on RMP's power when the sun isn't shining, avoid paying their full share of these fixed costs by reducing their monthly bills. As a result, net metering ""shifts costs"" from one class of customer to another, an imbalance the proposed fee seeks to correct, company and state experts testified.\A consultant retained by the Sierra Club, however, conducted an ""avoided cost"" analysis, and concluded RMP's 2,000 net metered customers last year benefited RMP by the tune of $1.4 million, mostly through offsetting the need to generate power and transmit the electrons over long distances.\""The benefits provided by residential net metering systems far outweigh any costs the Company claims rooftop solar systems impose on the utility,"" Dustin Mulvaney wrote in his testimony. ""Applying a fixed [net metering] charge will negatively impact the Company's solar incentive program by reducing customer investment in rooftop solar facilities and other distributed generation, reducing energy efficiency and conservation measures, and increasing harmful emissions.""\Mulvaney's arguments were echoed by dozens of Utah residents who addressed the commission Tuesday evening.\Mark Thomas, a member of the Mormon Environmental Stewardship Alliance, told commissioners they have yet to consider the avoided costs net-metering brings.\""Until you do, let the voice of wisdom speak in the streets. I went out in the streets. She is not there,"" said Thomas, an expert in public finance who has worked on Utah power stations. ""Reject this unjust fee.""\David Bennett, a net-metered Park City resident, said he installed solar not so much to save money, but to do the right thing.\""Look at the enormity of what's at stake here,"" Bennett said. ""Future generations will ask what did we do when we were put on notice that fossil fuels were limited and the harmful effect burning it would have on our environment, particularly the air.""\In recent weeks, the PSC has been inundated with 11,000 comments. Many decry Utah's poor ranking in solar production -- 31st in the nation -- while harboring the seventh largest solar energy resource.\Also opposing the fee are Salt Lake City and Salt Lake County. The Magna Community Council is among more than a dozen around the county that voted to ""ally ourselves with the future"" by passing resolutions opposing the fee on solar-powered homeowners.\""Such fees would act as a punishment tax for their participating in efficient use and conservation of electricity and for their individual utilization of 21st century technology,"" states the council's July 23 letter to the PSC. ""We also believe that the current use of fossil fuels, most especially coal, adds to the pollution that threatens the health and well-being of the rate payers, and those rate payers should not be further required to underwrite that threat.""\bmaffly@sltrib.com\Credit: By Brian Maffly The Salt Lake Tribune"
242," Environmentalists dream of the day when small nonpolluting power plants on individual homes will dot the landscape and huge energy projects such as the coal-fired Intermountain Power Project near Delta will be declared obsolete.\ Greg and Debbie Smith are living that dream in their home near Snowbasin in Ogden Canyon.\ Even in the depth of winter, the home's solar panels generate enough electricity to power their household appliances.\ ""After we decided to build here, Utah Power told us they wanted $70,000 to run a power line to our home,"" Debbie Smith said. ""That's when we decided to put in our [$35,000] solar system.""\ Encouraging other Utahns to think about renewable energy -- especially when lower-cost alternatives are available -- is a part of building a sustainable energy future for the state, said Kathy Van Dame of the Wasatch Clean Air Coalition.\ One way to help move the state in that direction would be for the Utah Legislature to adopt a new state law that would allow homeowners with solar- and wind-power systems to send their excess electricity onto their local utilities' electrical grids and receive a credit on their monthly bills.\ Utah is the only state in the West that does not require its electrical utilities to offer a ""net metering"" program. Net metering enables homeowners' electric meters to run backward so they can keep track of excess power they generate and make available to their utilities.\ A bill expected to go before the House of Representatives' Public Utilities and Technology Committee during the upcoming legislative session would bring Utah into the net-metering fold in the West.\ The proposed legislation is expected to see little, if any, opposition. Environmental groups and Utah Power are lining up to support it.\ The Utah Committee of Consumer Services briefly flirted with opposing the measure, not because it opposes self-generation, but over concerns that those Utahns who take advantage of net metering may be subsidized by those who do not.\ A small portion of every Utahn's monthly electricity bill goes to Utah Power or another utility to maintain the electricity delivery system, explained Roger Ball, the committee's administrative secretary.\ Utahns who take advantage of net metering and receive a credit from the utility occasionally would be able to sidestep that obligation.\ The committee decided, however, that from a financial standpoint the cross-subsidy potential would be miniscule. It also determined there were environmental factors in play that many believe could be beneficial.\ Net metering will contribute to long-term energy solutions and help the state rely on less electricity generated from coal, said Sarah Wright, coordinator of the Utah Wind Power Campaign and chairwoman of Utahns for an Energy Efficient Economy.\ Barring the cross-subsidy issue, which could affect the typical Utah residential electricity user by a ""nano-cent"" a year, there is little downside to allowing net metering, said Jeff Burks, energy policy coordinator for the Utah Energy Office.\ ""This isn't something that a lot of people are going to run out and embrace"" because solar and wind systems are expensive to install, Burks said. ""But it does give those people who are interested in generating their own electricity a little more incentive"" to do so.\ It also removes regulatory barriers that prevent customers from hooking up their systems to the utility's electrical grid, he said.\ The cost of installing a solar, or photo-voltaic, system on a home ranges from approximately $2,000 to more than $50,000, said Orrin Farnsworth of Intermountain Solar Technologies, a Utah distributor for solar energy products.\ ""A $2,000 system over a month might save a homeowner a dollar,"" Farnsworth said. ""With a more expensive system, they should be able to generate most of their own power and maybe have a little left over.""\ Utah Power's parent company, PacifiCorp, deals with net metering in the other states where it operates and supports the adoption of a program for Utah, said Bruce Griswold, director of energy contracts for PacifiCorp.\ ""There are already laws in place that allow large generators [of electricity] to sell their excess but what this does is address the residential and small business producers,"" he said.\ On one hand, homeowners who are able to produce more electricity than they consume represent a lost power sale for a utility. Yet they also can be looked upon as a ""system resource.""\ Every kilowatt of electricity routed by a homeowner to the utility's system is a kilowatt the company does not have to produce or buy on the open market.\ Another advantage is that a program can provide additional sources of power during periods of peak demand, Burks said.\ He explained that a photo-voltaic system produces most of its energy during the heat of the day -- the hours during the summer when demand for electricity to run air conditioners is at its peak.\ ""During those times of peak demand is when these systems are the most efficient and cost-effective,"" Burks said.\ Van Dame of the Wasatch Clean Air Coalition said allowing net metering in Utah may bring a market transformation -- one in which electricity is produced at the point of use.\ ""Most of the Utahns who embrace net metering will probably be those who are interested in the environment and those who genuinely want to increase their independence,"" Van Dame said.\ Overcoming the resistance of most homeowners to invest in individual solar or wind power generating systems is the challenge. ""The economics of those systems are going to improve. And as soon as you get over that hump, it will be all downhill,"" she said.\ steve@sltrib.com"
243,"Nearly 8,000 Utahns have made a personal investment in the power of the sun this year, and the state expects thousands more to join them ccc making 2016 the biggest year for solar by far.\But this news isn't all sunny ccc processing solar tax credits could cost the state $42 million, and industry leaders say residents rushing to jump on the solar bandwagon could fall prey to unscrupulous deals.\About 7,700 Utah residents signed up for Rocky Mountain Power's net metering program between January and June, according to company numbers. The utility had just 3,200 net metering customers in Utah at the end of 2015.\Laura Nelson, executive director of the Governor's Office of Energy Development (GOED), told lawmakers during an interim session last week that Utah is projected to process more than 12,000 applications for residential solar tax credits this year. Should that projection pan out, she said, it would mean more rooftop solar arrays would be installed in 2016 than in all past years combined.\While solar is on the rise nationally, rooftop arrays are especially popular in Utah. Rocky Mountain Power had 10,800 net metering customers in Utah as of the end of June, compared to 187 net metering customers in Idaho and 225 in Wyoming. According to a recently released report from the Frontier Group's Environment America Research and Policy Center, Utah was the fifth-fastest growing state for solar installations in 2015, with 77 watts of solar installed per capita in that year alone. Nevada topped the chart for solar, with 144 watts of solar per capita.\Rooftop solar power has grown steadily in Utah since about 2012, said Jeffrey Barrett, GOED deputy director, but nothing like what Utah has seen in the past six or seven months.\""The growth curve is basically vertical right now,"" he said. ""It's a remarkable time for this industry.""\Utahns are also buying larger rooftop arrays than in the past. In 2012, Barrett said, the average tax credit application involved a 3.5 kilowatt system. This year, he said, the average is closer to 6.5 kilowatts.\Low costs and advancing technology have converged to create the boom, he said.\At the moment, homeowners can get up to 40 percent of a solar installation refunded on their taxes, Barrett said, and the price of solar has gradually declined over the past several years as the market has grown and become more efficient. And solar technology has improved, increasing the performance of household systems, he said.\Orem resident Andrew Syme said he had been eying rooftop solar for about two years, but this past spring, the numbers hit an important benchmark ccc the point at which Syme could install a solar array on his roof and completely replace his power bill.\""For me, the whole reason I did it was because the monthly cost for the panels is less than my monthly electricity bills,"" Syme said. ""Right now I generate all my power. I have excess.""\Syme said his average electric bill was $170 a month before solar panels. Now, he said, he pays $159 per month for the 20-year home equity loan he used to finance the panels' installation.\Robert Olson, a salesman for Auric Solar, said he too crunched the numbers and decided 2016 was the year to put his money where his mouth was. He was never a big energy user ccc his last bill two months ago was just $35. But now, he said, he pays $60 a month for the loan on his panels, and has no power bill.\But a lot of what's making solar so affordable right now, Olson said, are the tax credits ccc and those aren't guaranteed to stick around.\Utah's residential solar tax credit is capped at $2,000, but with so many people expected to use it this year, the state could be looking at a $42 million cost, Barrett said. That's a lot more than in the past, he said, and it could cause lawmakers to do a double-take in the next session.\""We're looking at a program that's going to have a significant impact on the budget going forward if changes aren't made,"" Barrett said. ""I would be surprised if changes weren't proposed.""\But he predicted changes to the state program wouldn't impact the trend because the federal tax credits ccc which can cover up to 30 percent of a residential solar installation ccc aren't expected to go anywhere.\Derrik Shakespear, vice president of sales at Legend Solar, is worried that the current demand for solar could be bad news for the industry in the long run.\Trends like this can lead people to rush into purchasing decisions, which makes them more likely to fall prey to less-than-scrupulous business practices that may be rampant during a boom.\""Right now, so many people are just trusting the idea of solar that they're not even spending the minimal time needed to get the proper exposure to what they're buying,"" he said.\Shakespear said he's seen two recurring schemes where customers get ripped off. In one, he said, the seller says the panels will come with a warranty, when they in fact come with much more limited guarantees, or none at all.\Other customers, Shakespear said, buy an array from a salesman, only to be surprised when a third-party contractor shows up for the installation. A third-party contractor isn't necessarily a bad thing, he said, but it could be a red flag ccc salespeople sometimes bring in outside contractors to limit their own liability. Customers should know who's going to install their array, and shouldn't let themselves be rushed through a sale.\Shakespear said he's concerned these schemes could negatively affect upright operations.\""Our concern is that if people buy something not knowing enough about what they're buying, they could end up unhappy,"" he said. ""So we hope that in five years, solar still has a good name.""\At some point, Shakespear said, solar will reach market saturation, and growth will level off as salespeople turn their attention toward new homes and first-time homebuyers.\For now, though, business is pretty good.\epenrod@sltrib.com\Twitter: @EmaPen\Credit: By Emma Penrod The Salt Lake Tribune"
244,"If you put solar panels on your house and generate enough electricity to sell it to the power company to distribute to your neighbors, are you benefitting society?\Probably, but exactly how much is turning into a mighty difficult question.\Rocky Mountain Power, providers of electricity to most of Utah, rolled out its new formula for ""net metering"" customers, a small but fast growing group of homeowners who put solar panels on their roofs to power their own houses. When those panels produce more electricity than the house is consuming, the law requires that the utility buy that ""net"" energy for use by other customers.\Right now, net metering customers have all the same power rates that non-solar customers have, but Rocky Mountain has argued that net meterers, because they buy so little power, aren't paying their fair share for maintaining Rocky Mountain's power grid.\So the power company has developed a complicated billing formula that will raise rates for rooftop solar customers, and that has the burgeoning solar industry crying foul. They say the higher rates could effectively kill their industry, including the jobs it provides, and slow down our necessary conversion to renewable energy. Rooftop solar advocates also point out that they're not the only ones who don't use much power. Why aren't they making other low consumers pay more for the grid?\For their part, Rocky Mountain points out that the company is not relying on rooftop solar to move its customers to renewable energy. The company is now purchasing far more solar power from large-scale solar generators in southern Utah than from net meterers ccc and at a price below what they are paying the rooftop generators for their excess.\In other words, the rooftop folks can claim they're improving the environment, but they're not the only way to do that. In fact, when solar customers have been surveyed about why they did it, there are three main motivations: 1) because it saves money, 2) because it cleans up the environment, and 3) because they can be energy independent.\Only one of those is a societal benefit. For the other two, rooftop solar customers are looking out for themselves.\Still, there is good reason to believe that Rocky Mountain's study of the question, which is the basis for their rate request, is not giving rooftop solar enough credit. Other states have looked at this question, and they have tended to find more societal benefits to net metering, according to a Brookings Institution report in May. Only one of seven states thought that net meterers cost other customers more than they benefit them.\The Utah Public Service Commission has to decide on Rocky Mountain's request, and it has a responsibility to provide fairness to all electrical customers. To do that, they need more than Rocky Mountain's justification. Let a broader base of stakeholders look at this question before acting."
245,"As with many government actions, the Public Service Commission, and those companies it regulates, makes moral decisions in the regular course of business. The commission's decisions about what is important when determining rates for renewable energy sources involves making just such decisions. Unfortunately, Rocky Mountain Power is currently asking PSC to ignore the moral implications of setting rates for customers who use solar power.\Just a week or two ago, Rocky Mountain Power filed a legal brief to the PSC specifically stating that the Public Service Commission should be precluded from consideringcc""external benefits such as global health, social and environmental benefits that could theoretically be bolstered by net metering, but that are not directly enjoyed by the Company or its customers.""cc\To understand the moral implications of such a statement, look to Pope Francis. As the pope made clear in Laudato Si', the environment belongs to all of us: It is our common home. The protection of our home, through such things as our energy sources, is a responsibility shared by all of us, including the PSC and Rocky Mountain Power.\Pope Francis understands that ""we are not faced with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social, but rather one complex crisis which is both social and environmental."" As our own air quality attests, there is a strong, clear connection between energy production, environmental protection and public health. While Rocky Mountain Power discounts these indirect benefits, its focus solely on the benefits to its own bottom line will continue to harm the health of all Utahns.\Though Rocky Mountain Power asserts that PSC cannot consider any other factors than its economic desires, PSC has a far broader role to fill. As a public service agency, PSC does not exist just to prevent bad practice or promote business interests, but also to promote best practices to protect our common home.\Renewable resources must be an integral part of our state's best practices, and not just as feel-good measures. Solar energy has become ever more effective, efficient and affordable. It is also more sustainable than fossil fuel sources, offers creative opportunities in the energy field that could create new jobs and is cheaper over the long term, potentially helping low-income families meet their needs for electricity without having to forgo other necessities.\The protection of our common home is not assured by the simple, one-dimensional financial cost/benefit analysis sought by Rocky Mountain Power. As Pope Francis wrote, ""The environment is not one of those goods that can be adequately safeguarded or promoted by market forces."" Simply increasing profits for nonrenewable providers will not ensure that those providers actively seek new innovations in renewable resources.\We urge PSC to include in all of its discussions around solar and other energy sources not only the costs of providing for renewables within our system, but also the costs of not doing so. Solar is far less polluting, much easier to find and harness and, perhaps most important, provides substantial benefits to human health and the quality of life for future generations in our state. These moral considerations matter far more than the purely economic calculations sought by the utility.\Utah is a moral leader in many economic and political areas. We hope that PSC will show similar leadership as it determines what factors will matter when calculating rate increases requested by utilities.\Jean Hill is government liaison for the Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City.\Credit: By Jean Hill"

247,"By Ashley Stilson\Deseret News\SALT LAKE CITY - Solar energy advocates gathered downtown for a public hearing Wednesday to oppose a utility company's plan to raise rates for solar customers.\""These rate changes, if they go into effect, would be some of the most regressive in the nation and (would) stop the growth of rooftop solar in the state,"" said Michael Shea, senior policy associate for HEAL Utah, a clean-energy advocacy group.\Shea and other clean-energy advocates spoke to supporters at a news conference outside the Heber M. Wells Building, 160 E. 300 South. Inside, the Public Service Commission listened to community members speak against the plan to raise solar energy rates.\The plan initially was proposed last November, when Rocky Mountain Power asked the commission to approve a change in the net metering structure for solar customers.\Net metering lets homeowners with solar panels sell their extra solar energy back to the utility company. But every kilowatt generated on rooftops is one less the utility company sells.\Rocky Mountain Power first proposed charging customers per kilowatt for peak period demand and per kilowatt-hour for the amount of energy used, plus an application fee and fixed monthly rate.\However, those rates were discarded following negotiations between Rocky Mountain Power and solar companies.\Rocky Mountain Power spokesman Jon Cox said the current compromise focuses exclusively on reimbursement rates to customers when they want to send excess energy to the grid.\""We currently buy solar from two different sources: rooftop solar customers and solar farms,"" Cox said. ""The main difference between the two is that the state of Utah requires us to pay three times more for rooftop solar than solar farms. We believe that needs to change so our other customers aren't paying above-market rates for solar when other sources are readily available.""?\The alternate proposal was suggested in testimony by the Office of Consumer Services and Division of Public Utilities. Rocky Mountain Power expressed support for the changed proposal in a filing three weeks ago.\""You wouldn't pay any more for electricity under this proposal,"" Cox said. ""But if you want to sell your excess energy to us, we believe we should pay the fair market rate for energy instead of the full retail rate as currently provided in net metering.""\Solar advocates argue costs for customers will skyrocket if net metering changes are approved by the Public Service Commission.\""Utahns should have the opportunity to use the energy they produce on their roof within their own home and not be penalized for it,"" said Ryan Evans, president of the Utah Solar Energy Association.\Similar net metering changes were passed in Nevada in 2016. Solar panel installations dropped by 99 percent, and many major solar companies were forced to leave the state, local solar companies have said.\""Utah's rooftop solar energy is paving the way for the energy future in Utah,"" Evans said. ""We need to find a path forward that preserves the industry and allows Utahns to affordably invest in clean energy.""\At the public hearing, advocates for and against the Rocky Mountain Power proposal shared their thoughts.\Joel Eves, power director at Lehi City Power, said he's supportive of Rocky Mountain Power's approach to cover the solar costs. Lehi faces the same cost issues, he said, and the city wants to protect consumers who choose not to put solar panels on their homes.\""In Lehi, we have 200 solar customers, about 1 percent, as we cross 20,000 customers this year,"" Eves said at the hearing. ""Our big challenge in Lehi is stabilizing those rates for those who have lived there a long time.\""When we have solar customers coming in, our concern is when they're not paying those costs, then they're going to be passed on to the other 19,800 people,"" he said.\David Bennett said he installed rooftop solar panels on his Park City home in 2010.\""I didn't do it for economic reasons, because certainly back then it didn't make economic sense,"" Bennett said at the public hearing.\""I did it because it was the right thing to do,"" he said. ""We shouldn't be taxed and have to pay more because of our commitment to the environment.""\Professional snowboarder Forrest Shearer said he's against the proposal because he's seen how carbon pollution damages outdoor recreational activities.\""We must actively address climate change now,"" Shearer said at the hearing. ""This recent proposal penalizes these efforts rather than rewards them.""\Jane Myers, a instructor at the University of Utah and Eisenhower Junior High in Taylorsville, said she and several of her students suffer from asthma.\""We put in 17 solar panels in March because we felt strongly that we wanted our grandkids and our great-grandkids to have clean air,"" Myers said. ""My neighbors benefit from my panels and draw in less power from coal-fired plants during the summer when I'm producing power.""\Email: astilson@deseretnews.com\Credit: By Ashley Stilson Deseret News"
248,"As winter heads toward spring every year, the electrical output from the solar array atop David Bennett's Park City home climbs while his power usage declines with the lengthening days.\As a result, Bennett ""banks"" hundreds of kilowatt hours with Rocky Mountain Power to cover his power needs when the sunshine isn't pouring into his photovoltaic panels.\But on March 31, the end of the annual billing cycle, the utility zeroes out such ""net metered"" accounts, meaning these customers often forfeit a significant slice of their excess power. Bennett and other Utah solar-powered homeccowners point to this annual gift to RMP to argue against its controversial proposal to impose a monthly $4.65 ""facilities charge"" on net-metered customers.\""This is such a blatant attempt to discourage future solar. It's scandalous,"" Bennett said.\But the utility says the expired credits are not much of a gift because the power Bennett and others produce on their roofs is of little use to the utility.\Less than .5 percent of RMP's residential customers, currently about 2,700, have net meters -- which measure both the power they pull off the grid and the excess solar power they put back in -- but the number is rapidly growing as the popularity of rooftop arrays grows.\With backing from state officials, RMP says the proposed fee would ensure such customers help cover the utility grid's massive costs that remain fixed regardless of how much power it moves. They avoid covering their share of maintaining this infrastructure by lowering their monthly bills, the utility argues. The Utah Public Service Commission (PSC) is expected to decide whether to approve the fee by early next month.\Clean-energy advocates have called on the commission to reject the fee, while local governments and political leaders have asked the three-member panel to postpone a decision until it conducts a meaningful cost-benefit analysis of net metering.\Salt Lake City Mayor Ralph Becker and other leaders contend the fees' proponents ignore the broad benefits solar power provides society and the environment by reducing the state's reliance on coal.\The utility, which claims such benefits are illusory, has framed the issue as one of ""social justice,"" saying customers who cannot afford to net meter should not subsidize those who equip their homes with solar. Last year, net-metered customers put nearly 1 million kilowatt hours (kWh) into the grid. That's not much, equivalent to what about 100 Utah homes use in a year, said utility spokesman Dave Eskelsen.\RMP values that power at about 3 cents per kWh, far less than the 8.8 to 14 cents it charges. A kilowatt hour is the amount of electricity needed to power 10 100-watt light bulbs for an hour.\Power that is valuable to the utility is available in bulk and can be accessed when needed, especially when demand peaks between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m., Eskelsen said. These are the very qualities that the power from solar arrays lacks.\But clean-energy advocates say RMP sells excess net-metered power, typically generated during the middle of summer days, to these customers' neighbors at retail rates. This is power it does not have to generate at centralized coal-burning stations and ship more than 100 miles through the grid, losing much of it along the way, said Jared Campbell, a net-metered customer in Salt Lake City.\""Even if there is a surge in demand at 5 p.m., there is still huge demand at noon they have to supply,"" said Campbell, who generates more power than he can use. On sunny June days his home can pump around 40 kilowatts into the grid between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.\He had more than 1,100 kWh left in his account on March 31 when it was reset to zero. This represents electricity that was used by his neighbors who paid RMP about $100 for it.\Bennett forfeited 1,150 kWh on March 31 and 1,849 the year before. Campbell's and Bennett's big surpluses reflect their large systems, both exceeding seven kilowatts. A more typical surplus is the 500 to 600 kWh forfeited each year by Ted and Paulette Roche, of Sandy.\But according to RMP data, those who lose credits are a minority, representing about one-sixth of all net-metered customers. This year a total of 264,176 kWh expired. The utility valued these credits at $10,620 and will use this money next year to reduce bills for low-income ratepayers.\""We advise to size your system to match your home's need,"" Eskelsen said.\In Campbell's case, he increased his home's needs -- by converting all his heating needs to electricity and driving an electric Nissan Leaf -- to match his 40-panel system.\The Roches' 7.7-kilowatt system covers nearly all the power needs for their Sandy home, equipped with air conditioning and a hot tub. Martha Kay powers her Vernal home with a 4.6-kilovolt system. These customers believe the utility is grossly undervaluing the power they supply.\""RMP doesn't incur the expense of producing our power .... yet sells it at its going rate, therefore making a profit on my power and those of other solar panel customers,"" Kay wrote in an email.\But Eskelsen contends this electricity is not worth nearly as much as net-metered customers think, in part because the grid is designed for one-way flow of electrons. That limits how far the solar power they generate can be sent.\""They are talking about energy and we are talking about fixed costs,"" Eskelsen said, arguing net-metered customers receive a substantial benefit by being hooked into a grid they are not fully funding.\""They are virtually storing energy in the utility system and taking it in the following months when their system is not producing,"" Eskelsen.\""The rate at which they are being credited for the power they produce is three or four times its value to the utility. I understand emotions are running high, but belief is not evidence. They made an assumption about net meter installation that is unwarranted.""\The utility argues that net metering benefits no one other than the solar-power customers who minimize their power bills. Rooftop photovoltaics do not offset the need to generate power at centralized plants or lessen pressure on the grid, RMP experts testified last week before the PSC.\However, the record reflects little effort to explore the potential benefits of net metering, according to retired regulator Judith Johnson, whose 13-year tenure with the Utah Division of Public Utilities spanned the wild price spikes of 2000-01. She argued rooftop solar can act as an invaluable hedge against fluctuations in the wholesale prices of power and fuels.\Price regulation is imprecise and based on averages, Johnson noted. Accordingly, no one expects rural customers to pay more for power, though servicing them requires greater infrastructure investments.\The same argument RMP is using to charge solar-equipped homes extra could be used against rural residents, as well as those who use less power either through efficiency measures or because they are too poor to own air conditioners and electronics, she told the commission Tuesday, when the panel heard six hours of public comments.\bmaffly@sltrib.com\-- How the $4.65 charge for solar customers was calculated Rocky Mountain Power determined the average monthly usage for residential customers is 698 kilowatt hours, which results in a $16.72 contribution toward RMP's fixed costs. Net-metered customers' average use is 518 kWh, so their contribution is $12.46. The difference is $4.26, the amount the utility first proposed as a ""facilities charge"" on net-metered customers. It has since increased that to $4.65 after it agreed to raise the monthly service charge from $5 to $6 instead of to $8. -- Net metering, by the numbers 2,412 - Net-metered Utah customers (as of March 31) 686 - New facilities installed in 2013 17.8 megawatts - Generation capacity 975,019 kilowatt hours - Excess generation 264,176 kilowatt hours - Lost by net-metered customers when credits expired Source Utah Public Service Commission\Credit: By Brian Maffly The Salt Lake Tribune"
249,"
ST. GEORGE -- Sheldon and LaVerna Johnson don't have millions of dollars, and they're not tree-huggers. That's why it would surprise most to look at this retired couple and see the solar panels lining their roof.
\
Two years ago, the couple installed 24 solar panels on the south side of their home, providing the ability to generate 3,000 watts of energy. The Johnsons are apparently the first people in St. George to use the devices.
\
They paid $15,000 to have the panels put up in 2005 -- a large sum up front, but the Johnsons point to their monthly power bills. The highest so far has been $18.20. And the lowest, 35 cents, is a far cry from the $100 to $150 average monthly electricity bills their son pays next door.
\
And in a city that gets an average of 300 days of sunshine a year, the Johnsons generate so much power that they sell most of it back to the city -- hence the surprisingly low bills.
\
""It isn't profitable right at first because you're buying $15,000 in power bills ahead of yourself. But the end result is great,"" said Sheldon Johnson, a retired optometrist who is well-known for discovering a large set of dinosaur tracks on his farm on the outskirts of St. George. ""It's so simple; there's nothing to it.""
\
The Johnsons got the idea from Sheldon's son Kerry, who runs the local area electric company KV Electric. He had recently finished installing a huge solar unit for the government at Lehman Cave in Great Basin National Park. He persuaded Sheldon and LaVerna to get their own set, and they became pioneers of such projects in St. George.
\
""We wanted to do it because we're saving our environment, helping our community and our world,"" said LaVerna Johnson, a published poet. ""We're investing in the future with these on our roof.""
\
St. George uses the Johnsons' home in brochures for the city and sends people by to check out the panels. Their home was also included in a state solar home tour. The panels are hard to notice from the street, and from inside the home, LaVerna Johnson said: ""You don't even know it's there until you get your power bill.""
\
Sheldon Johnson said ""the magic of it all"" is that their solar power joins with the power of the city. Through a net metering program with St. George Public Utilities, a bidirectional meter is installed that reads what power the solar panels are producing, what power the city is producing and the net of the two. Any power the solar panels generate that the Johnsons don't use is then sold back to the city.
\
However, that process was rough in the beginning, the Johnsons said, plainly because the city didn't know how to bill them. Others still were skeptical the Johnsons would even save a dime.
\
""They were the first residential or commercial to put solar in the city,"" said Rene Fleming, St. George's conservation coordinator. She said the city had to institute the net metering program for the Johnsons. ""They were kind of our test case.""
\
""Sheldon seems to have quite a commitment to doing what's right in his life, in terms of environment,"" she added, noting he outfitted his home with energy-efficient appliances. ""He's in general environmentally aware and very progressive to make the investment in solar.""
\
Today, Fleming said, 10 homes in the city use solar power. More utility customers are looking into it, she said.
\
It's also a high priority for the city. As prices to convert to solar power have dropped, it's becoming a more economically sound project for cities to invest in. Earlier this year, the new St. George Water and Energy Administration building installed a $50,000 solar power system.
\
""There's a lot of discussion of global warming, there's a lot of discussion of the environmental impacts of energy generation. Renewable energy won't solve all of our problems, but it certainly will help,"" she said. ""We're right in the heart of the Sun Belt. For us, it's a really good option.""
\
St. George also gives rebates to people who put solar power in their home -- $2,000 per installed kilowatt, based on an 85 percent energy efficiency rating.
\
Although the Johnsons were too far ahead of the curve to get the rebate, they have no regrets. They're just happy to help.
\
""It helps the city and it helps us. That's a perfect system,"" Sheldon Johnson said.

250,"
Last Wednesday, in the haze following the presidential election, Rocky Mountain Power (RMP) finally made its move against Utah's burgeoning rooftop solar industry. Circumventing the regular rate setting process, RMP released a proposal to charge rooftop solar owners - and only rooftop solar owners - a complicated three-part rate structure that will force them to fork over hundreds of additional dollars to RMP each year. RMP hopes to have the Utah Public Service Commission adopt its proposal by Dec. 9, a mere 30 days after its release.
\
Frankly, I can't recall seeing a more blatantly anti- competitive move by a company that purports to act in the interests of our community. This new rate structure is not about ""fairness"" for ratepayers; it is designed to snuff out the rooftop solar industry in Utah.
\
If you want proof, look no further than Nevada. Just over a year ago, NV Energy rammed through a similar, if not nearly as aggressive, net metering rate change targeting rooftop solar purchasers. Over the last 12 months, rooftop solar installations in Nevada have fallen by 99 percent, as the new fees charged by NV Energy swallowed up the benefits of rooftop solar. Both RMP and NV Energy are public electric monopolies owned by Berkshire Energy, one of the largest utility conglomerates in the United States. It's no surprise that RMP is trying to replicate the Nevada strategy in Utah.
\
According to its Public Service Commission filing, RMP believes that this new rate structure is justified, in large part, because ""solar generation does not coincide with [RMP's] peak load."" The argument goes like this: Since RMP is responsible for ensuring there is enough electricity to cover periods of peak energy demand, and because rooftop solar customers' peak energy production periods do not overlap with those periods of peak energy demand, rooftop solar customers don't reduce RMP's capital investment needs and therefore aren't saving the overall system money. In essence, RMP claims that the existing net metering rules - which credit rooftop solar owners for electricity their solar panels pump back into RMP's electric grid - are overly generous to rooftop solar owners and that they are not paying their ""fair share"" to RMP.
\
But what RMP's proposal does NOT acknowledge is that the rooftop solar industry is tantalizingly close to developing cost-effective battery technology that would allow rooftop solar owners to store solar energy during non-peak hours and feed it back into RMP's electric grid during peak hours. This would negate RMP's foundational argument against the rooftop solar industry, and usher in a new era of competition that would directly challenge RMP's lucrative monopoly position in Utah.
\
This is not lost on RMP and its shareholders. They have a lot to lose in a competitive market environment. Right now, RMP commands, and the Utah Public Service Commission approves, huge, ratepayer-guaranteed returns on the capital it invests, returns that in today's market would be the envy of every high-flying hedge fund. To put it more simply, RMP is making a fortune off of its monopoly position in Utah, and you are paying for it.
\
Over 8,000 Utah households have purchased and installed rooftop solar units over the past several years. There is clearly high consumer demand for rooftop solar, and the positive externalities of the rooftop solar market, including improved energy self-reliance and environmental cleanliness, are not yet fully understood or quantified. As a result, the Utah Public Service Commission should reject, or at least delay for a period of several years, RMP's new net metering proposal to give the rooftop solar industry a chance to further grow and evolve. Allowing it to do so could usher in a new era of price competition to a market that desperately needs it.

The state of Utah is on the precipice of a solar revolution, but its trajectory could be disrupted by the looming expiration of the federal investment tax credit (ITC) for solar energy.
\
Utah is just beginning to tap into its solar energy potential, ranking No. 5 in installed solar capacity out of all the mountain states of the West. It now has enough solar energy installed to power 5,500 homes; however, more solar development is in the works that will bring Utah closer to its neighboring states like Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico, which are already booming with solar activity.
\
In reality, this spike in activity has already started.
\
In May, the largest operating solar power plant in Utah successfully came online. The South Milford solar facility in Milford boasts 3.8 megawatts (MW) and is expected to generate enough electricity to power more than 500 homes, eliminating more than 12 million pounds of carbon dioxide per year, the equivalent of taking more than 1,200 cars off the road.
\
Furthermore, Utah is expected to jump from 32 MW of total installed solar capacity to over 500 MW in just the next two years. If you think about it, that would be adding enough solar capacity to power an additional 90,000 homes in the state.
\
Milestones like this are possible because of smart and effective public policies, like Utah's net metering policy, renewable portfolio goal, sales tax exemption and tax credit, along with the federal ITC. Thanks to the federal ITC, more than 1,500 jobs were created in Utah in 2014, which include jobs from the state's largest employer - Vivint Solar. Thousands of additional Utahns can count on solar jobs too, as 500 MW of solar capacity are added over the next two years.
\
Consider what's occurred in America since the federal ITC was enacted in 2006:
\
* Solar has been added to 570,000 homes.
\
* More than 150,000 solar jobs have been created.
\
* More than 19.5 gigawatts of solar capacity have been installed - representing 97 percent of all solar capacity ever installed.
\
To put the effectiveness of the federal ITC into more perspective, more solar was installed in one week in 2015 than was installed in all of 2006. And prior to 2006, only one state had over 100 MW in solar capacity. There are now 19 states that have reached 100 MW in cumulative capacity. Utah is well on its way to shattering 100 MW, but threatening to derail its solar boom is the looming expiration of the federal ITC for solar energy.
\
By contrast, competing energy sources, such as fossil fuels, have had preferential treatment in the U.S. tax code for up to 100 years, while solar has had the federal ITC as an incentive for private investment for less than 10.
\
As an industry, we're strongly urging Utah's congressional delegation to support extending the ITC for at least five years. By then, many analysts are predicting, solar will reach grid parity in most electricity markets, helping to create a level playing field among energy producers, which will benefit consumers, the U.S. economy and our environment.
\
Solar is an economic engine for America, and its future in Utah should be bright.
\
Rhone Resch is president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, the national trade organization for America's solar energy industry. During his 10-year tenure at SEIA, solar has experienced record-breaking growth, becoming one of the fastest-growing industries in America with more than 8,000 companies and more than 174,000 employees.

Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. has set a statewide goal for Utah's municipalities to receive 20 percent of their power from renewable sources, such as solar, by 2025.\""We are trying to be proactive about it,"" Fleming said.

258,"\Is solar still a good investment?\If you’ve traversed I-15 recently, you likely saw several billboards encouraging you to install a solar energy system before Nov. 15, when the new solar rate structure for Rocky Mountain Power customers went into effect.\While there were some advantages to signing up before the 15th, the good news is that rooftop solar is still a great investment for Utahns. In fact, now is still a great time to go solar.\Based on customer research conducted by the Utah Solar Energy Association (USEA), we’ve found the top reasons Utahns go solar is because they want to save money on their utility bills, do their part to improve the environment, specifically our air quality, and they feel it is a beneficial way to prepare for emergencies.\Driven by these and other motivations, more than 35,000 households and businesses in Utah have installed solar panels. Here are three reasons why investing in solar is still a good idea:\The new solar rate structure lets Utahns continue to affordably invest in rooftop solar.\One of the best parts of having solar panels is taking advantage of net metering. Net metering works like this: When you generate more energy from your panels than you consume, you export the excess energy to Rocky Mountain Power and receive a credit to offset your utility bill.\Previously, Rocky Mountain Power customers with a solar energy system were compensated differently based on a kilowatt-hour (kWh) credit, which was subject to change. For the first time, Utah has a fixed rate export credit structure for each kWh export. Most importantly, this export rate is protected through 2032 — a 15-year guarantee. To put that into context, if you have a 3-year-old, you’ll be compensated at the same export credit rate through their high school graduation.\Utahns can now go solar with the utmost confidence in their investment.\In addition to the guaranteed export credit rate, all the energy your system produces and directly consumed in your home or business is not subject to penalty or fees. Solar customers are also now protected in the same rate class as non-solar customers, and will continue to pay the same base fees as their non-solar counterparts.\This is important because previously Utahns had no certainty that their rooftop solar investments would be protected in the long term. Now with an export credit rate certainty for 15 years, you have a fixed timeframe by which you can measure the return on your investment.\The top reason Utahns go solar — to save money — is still valid.\As mentioned earlier, USEA’s customer research found one of the most popular reasons Utahns go solar is to save money.

Businesses can receive up to $50,000 as a tax credit. These tax credits, combined with electricity savings, can help customers who purchase a system outright break even on their solar investment faster.\We’re proud that the compromise with Rocky Mountain Power allows Utahns to continue to affordably invest in rooftop solar, gives future customers rate certainty for 15 years and allows solar customers to power their own homes without being penalized.\CREDIT: Ryan Evans"
259,"You may have seen or read about those solar panels on the roof of the Salt Palace Convention Center that help to supply the building's electric power. That system is good for the environment because it is fueled by the sun instead of coal or natural gas. It also helps to reduce, by a very small amount, the total demand on Rocky Mountain Power's supply during the heat of a summer's day.\But there's a legal limit, literally, on how much credit such a facility can get on its power bill for producing some of its own electricity. Salt Lake County Mayor Peter Corroon wants to increase that limit in Utah law, and, in the process, encourage similar renewable energy projects at other county facilities and beyond.\We believe that's a good idea. If a person, business or government is willing to invest in a system to generate clean, renewable electricity, that investment should be rewarded by at least an offset on a power bill.\Utah has had such a system since 2002. It's called a net metering program. Suppose a utility customer has a system that generates electricity using a fuel cell or a renewable technology, and that customer is able to produce enough power to supply her needs plus some excess that she provides to the utility through its grid. The utility furnishes a meter that is able to measure the amount of electricity that the utility supplies to the customer and the amount that the customer supplies to the utility. The difference is the net.\Customers with solar systems usually generate power by day but buy it from the utility at night.\If the customer supplies more electricity than she takes during a billing period, she gets a credit on her bill.\However, under current law, that credit is limited to a generating capacity of 25 kilowatts. The Salt Palace system now generates about 20 kilowatts, and the county is installing a similar system at the Clark Planetarium that would produce 25 kilowatts.\The legislation Corroon is supporting would increase the allowable capacity under the net metering program to 2 megawatts. County officials believe that the Salt Palace has enough room on its roof to expand the system to about 1.8 megawatts.\It's a small step toward greater independence from electricity generated from fossil fuels, but it's a step Utah should take.\If a person, business or government is willing to invest in a system to generate clean, renewable electricity, that investment should be rewarded by at least an offset on a power bill.\Credit: Tribune Editorial"
260,"Solar power generated on the roofs of utility customers doesn't do much to reduce the need to produce electricity at centralized generating stations or ease pressure on Rocky Mountain Power's (RMP) electrical grid, according to testimony Monday before the Utah Public Service Commission (PSC).\Experts for the major Utah utility made these claims to support its proposal to impose a $4.65 monthly ""facilities charge"" on net metered customers, the small but quickly growing number who generate their own power with photovoltaic arrays.\The proposed fee has outraged solar-equipped customers, clean energy advocates and some local government and elected leaders who say it ignores many benefits the solar generation brings not just to the grid but also to the environment and society.\But by reducing their electric bills, such residential customers are avoiding their share of the utility's fixed costs associated with electrical transmission and customer service, according to Joelle Stewart, RMP's cost-of-service manager.\""All this infrastructure is necessary to service these customers. These costs do not go away with the growth in net metering,"" Stewart told the PSC, the three-member panel that sets electrical rates.\This assertion, which is hotly disputed by environmental groups and solar customers, was echoed by Daniel Gimble of the Utah Office of Consumer Service.\The consumer advocate recommended charging $1.54 per kilowatt of generating capacity -- in contrast with the flat fee the utility proposes -- so those with smaller systems would pay less.\Salt Lake City Mayor Ralph Becker is among a cast of local officials asking the PSC to more fully consider the benefits of net metering before authorizing any fee that would discourage its growth, which many see as vital to a cleaner, more secure energy future.\The city's sustainability manager, Tyler Poulson, said a similar fee authorized for an Arizona utility last year led to a 40 percent drop in new solar installations. He claimed solar users may help the grid by helping to ease future load growth.\""But there are other benefits in terms of avoided environmental regulation, and reduced reliance on finite fossil fuels and price volatility associated with that, air quality and quality of life issues,"" Poulson said Monday on Trib Talk, the Tribune's daily online video chat with Utah newsmakers.\An RMP spokesman countered that these benefits are far from certain.\""There isn't general agreement on how to calculate environmental or societal benefits. More importantly it's unclear how those benefits are factored into the price of electricity,"" Dave Eskelsen said.\The PSC hearing continues Tuesday with additional testimony from experts with the Sierra Club and other ""intervenor"" organizations. The commission will field public comments at 5 p.m. Opponents of the fee will stage a 4 p.m. rally in front of Salt Lake City's Heber Wells Building, where the hearing is taking place this week.\bmaffly@sltrib.com\Credit: By Brian Maffly The Salt Lake Tribune"
261,"\Is solar still a good investment?\If you’ve traversed I-15 recently, you likely saw several billboards encouraging you to install a solar energy system before Nov. 15, when the new solar rate structure for Rocky Mountain Power customers went into effect.\While there were some advantages to signing up before the 15th, the good news is that rooftop solar is still a great investment for Utahns. In fact, now is still a great time to go solar.\Based on customer research conducted by the Utah Solar Energy Association (USEA), we’ve found the top reasons Utahns go solar is because they want to save money on their utility bills, do their part to improve the environment, specifically our air quality, and they feel it is a beneficial way to prepare for emergencies.\Driven by these and other motivations, more than 35,000 households and businesses in Utah have installed solar panels. Here are three reasons why investing in solar is still a good idea:\The new solar rate structure lets Utahns continue to affordably invest in rooftop solar.\One of the best parts of having solar panels is taking advantage of net metering. Net metering works like this: When you generate more energy from your panels than you consume, you export the excess energy to Rocky Mountain Power and receive a credit to offset your utility bill.\Previously, Rocky Mountain Power customers with a solar energy system were compensated differently based on a kilowatt-hour (kWh) credit, which was subject to change. For the first time, Utah has a fixed rate export credit structure for each kWh export. Most importantly, this export rate is protected through 2032 — a 15-year guarantee. To put that into context, if you have a 3-year-old, you’ll be compensated at the same export credit rate through their high school graduation.\Utahns can now go solar with the utmost confidence in their investment.\In addition to the guaranteed export credit rate, all the energy your system produces and that is directly consumed in your home or business is not subject to penalty or fees. Solar customers are also now protected in the same rate class as non-solar customers, and will continue to pay the same base fees as their non-solar counterparts.\This is important because previously Utahns had no certainty that their rooftop solar investments would be protected in the long term. Now with an export credit rate certainty for 15 years, you have a fixed timeframe by which you can measure the return on your investment.\The top reason Utahns go solar — to save money — is still valid.\As mentioned earlier, USEA’s customer research found one of the most popular reasons Utahns go solar is to save money. Under this new rate structure, solar still makes a lot of financial sense for Rocky Mountain Power customers.\The federal Solar Investment Tax Credit currently offers a 30 percent credit on your system purchase, and individuals can also claim the Utah Renewable Energy System Tax Credit for $1,600 in 2018, 2019 and 2020 (pending approval of proposed legislation). Businesses can receive up to $50,000 as a tax credit. These tax credits, combined with electricity savings, can help customers who purchase a system outright break even on their solar investment faster.\We’re proud that the compromise with Rocky Mountain Power allows Utahns to continue to affordably invest in rooftop solar, gives future customers rate certainty for 15 years and allows solar customers to power their own homes without being penalized.\CREDIT: Ryan Evans, Deseret News Hive"
262,"In meeting rooms, council chambers, and at the Utah State Legislature, the question is being asked; What is the ""value"" of rooftop solar? When rooftop solar systems generate more power than a home is using, the electricity goes back into the grid and the utility buys it. This process is called net-metering. The value of that electricity is now the topic of important energy pricing debates. The higher dollar value of solar energy, the more affordable rooftop solar systems are to Utah families.\The equations used to determine the value of net-metering calculate costs such as the price of generating and delivering energy. However, one factor has been conspicuously absent from Utah's discussions: the net benefit of rooftop solar's critical environmental contributions.\Those environmental benefits are difficult to calculate, but certainly not impossible. In 2014, Minnesota utility regulators studied the full costs and benefits of rooftop solar systems. The Minnesota study calculated an ""avoided environmental cost."" This includes the money that a society saves when power comes from solar panels instead of burning fossil fuels. It considers everything from healthier families to negating the effects of climate change. More solar means less carbon and that means cleaner air, fewer health/air related ailments, more productive farms, and fewer natural disasters.\Here's another way to look at this. The way we're making power now, by burning fossil fuels, is already costing society a not-so-small pile of money. When coal power emissions trigger an asthma attack for a child with Medicaid health benefits and she ends up in an emergency room, we all pay the bill. When a coastal community in Florida is forced to spend tens of millions to build walls and pipes to keep rising sea waters at bay, we pay the bill. When rising temperatures force millions of Americans to use their air conditioners for more hours on more days, we pay the bill. All because we have increased carbon dioxide in our atmosphere from burning coal.\But none of those costs appear on your electricity bill. Economists call them an ""externality."" This is defined as a cost suffered by a third party as a result of an economic transaction. The third party in this case is all of us.\Since those ""externalities"" don't appear on your bills, fossil fuel fired electricity prices are kept artificially low. Utilities that depend on fossil fuels ccc such as Rocky Mountain Power which burns coal and natural gas for about three-fourths of their electricity -- are effectively getting a free ride and forcing the public to pay the cost, both in terms of actual cash and health care costs.\When a study like Minnesota's acknowledges that solar saves society money by avoiding fossil fuel's true costs, it boosts the value of developing solar, today. That keeps rooftop solar affordable to families that are deciding whether they want to install panels, boost their self-reliance, increase the value of their home ccc and do their part to protect public health and the environment.\As appointed commissions and elected officials around Utah grapple with putting an appropriate value on rooftop solar, they must remember: The true cost of how we power our modern world is complicated. If we continue to ignore the real costs, we are all going to pay a much greater price down the road ccc sacrificing both our dollars and our health.\Michael Shea is a policy associate with HEAL Utah who focuses on clean energy\Credit: By Michael Shea"

A recent article (""Students join fray over solar net metering,"" May 13) was a ray of sunshine (pun intended) from the young and inspired Rowland Hall students who envision a better and brighter future for Utah.
\
While protecting rooftop solar should remain a top goal for all generations of Utahns, the article was a refreshing reminder that today's youth, as exemplified by those extraordinary young people, do care about protecting the viability of our solar resources.
\
It is tremendous to see students lead the charge to protect our environment and diversify our energy portfolio. Hopefully, this commendable movement will help to keep the pressure on our biggest utility, Rocky Mountain Power, to not pursue legislation disincentivizing solar. The obvious economic, environmental and societal benefits make solar energy a viable option that is here to stay.

In the past several months, various stakeholders have debated the merits of Rocky Mountain Power's proposal to raise monthly rates on future rooftop solar customers in Utah.
\
Both sides make strong arguments, and a compromise between the two industries should be reached. Yet, policymakers and rate setters should avoid actions that would significantly cripple the roof-top solar industry before it fully matures.
\
The intensifying battles over solar energy are a clear indication that the solar industry is slowly but surely coming of age. And just as teenagers are eventually expected to give up the privileges and supports that protect them during their youth, this fledgling industry must also eventually transition to full contributor status.
\
The timing of this transition should be the essence of today's solar energy policy debates, and the Beehive State has to get this transition right in order to drive key energy and environmental outcomes for years to come.
\
Utilities, such as local electricity, have long held what amounts to a government-sanctioned monopoly. While there have been some modest attempts at making electric service more competitive, roof-top solar technology may represent the first viable challenge to the incumbent electricity suppliers.
\
It and other alternative energy technologies may represent to the electric power industry what cellphones represented to the telephone industry - a transforming innovation. It's worth noting that cellphones were prohibitively expensive until innovation brought the technology to viable maturity.
\
There will come a time when solar will have to stand on its own. Now is not that time. Sensible financial and regulatory supports, including subsidized use of the grid, should be preserved as this industry continues to innovate and mature.
\
The proposed electric rate structure could effectively shut down the solar industry in the state. Rocky Mountain Power is asking the Public Service Commission to approve charging new solar panel customers a $15 fixed monthly rate for costs such as customer service and meter reading, as well as steeper energy use charges and a one-time application fee of $60 to cover administrative costs. In short, the math for many potential solar panel customers doesn't work out.
\
To be sure, the efforts of Rocky Mountain Power to insist on a more level playing field are sound and some modest charges may be in order. Net metering and demand charges have real-world cost and revenue implications for incumbent suppliers, and often those costs get passed onto consumers, many of whom could not now afford rooftop power.
\
However, the rooftop solar industry is far from reaching diminishing returns in its efficiency and innovation, and its potential long-term benefits to household budgets and the environment are likely significant. In one of the most sunny states in the nation, this industry deserves the opportunity to continue to innovate while also being held accountable to demonstrate that those innovations are sustainable and scalable on their own merits over the long term.
\
Rocky Mountain contends that rooftop customers are using the grid without paying their fair share of the costs. This may be true. Yet, the industry offers the promise of bringing Utah consumers an appealing alternative that may over time greatly reduce the economic and environmental costs of energy. Utah would be wise to give it time.

265,"As a 20-year-old college student, I spent a recent Monday not in class, but listening to a highly consequential Utah Public Service Commission hearing. The hearing invited comment on a request by Rocky Mountain Power to reduce its solar energy export credit by 85%, a decision that would jeopardize solar energy development across the state.\As I listened to community members, solar owners and energy entrepreneurs share their concerns, one thing was clear: Rocky Mountain Power’s request is bad for Utah.\As a lifelong Utahn, I have frequently witnessed Rocky Mountain Power lend input and support to environmental initiatives within our state. But in light of Rocky Mountain Power’s effort to undermine Utah’s rooftop solar industry, I question if the company is truly dedicated to sustainability, or if it is simply green washing: marketing itself as environmentally friendly but failing to sufficiently minimize its environmental impact.\In 2018, I worked with a coalition of more than 250 students to introduce a resolution on climate change through the Utah Legislature. This resolution “recognizes the impacts of a changing climate on Utah citizens, encourages the reduction of emissions, and expresses commitment to create and support economically viable and broadly, supported solutions.” Rocky Mountain Power endorsed this resolution, helping us gain the political support to pass it.\In January of this year, the Utah Roadmap: Positive Solutions for Climate and Air Quality was released by the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. This report states that “market-based incentives for renewable energy may offer positive solutions for reducing emissions.” Rocky Mountain Power offered input for this report, with a representative from the company serving on the report’s technical advisory committee.\While Rocky Mountain Power appears to be supportive of resolutions and nonbinding commitments to environmental sustainability, in the case of rooftop solar, it fails to walk its talk. Utah is among the top 11 states in the U.S. for solar energy production, with over 300 sunny days each year.\For those who choose to invest in rooftop solar, a process called “net metering” makes solar panels pay for themselves over time. In this process, solar users sell the excess energy that their panels generate back to Rocky Mountain Power for an export credit, lowering their energy costs.\But if Rocky Mountain Power’s request to the Public Service Commission is granted, the average export credit would be reduced from 9.2 cents to 1.56 cents per kilowatt hour, which would effectively kill off residential solar in the state. In the words of Ryan Evans, the president of the Utah Solar Energy Association, “What Rocky Mountain Power is proposing for the new rate structure would grind our industry to a halt in this state.”\As Rocky Mountain Power stifles the solar industry, it continues to invest heavily in fossil fuels. As a result, 66% of Utah’s energy comes from coal-fired power, the energy source that is the largest emitter of climate-altering pollution in the western United States.\RMP’s failure to more robustly invest in alternative energy could be particularly consequential for our state. Utah is among the fastest warming states in the country. Increases in average annual statewide temperatures result in impacts on short-term local weather events, like heat waves, drought, wildfires and flooding. Utahns are worried about these impacts and ready for change. Some 85% of the state’s residents support funding for more research into renewable energy sources, including 83% of Republicans and 94% of Democrats. Despite these trends, Rocky Mountain Power is cutting off renewable energy users at the knees, putting at risk the jobs of the 7,000 people who are employed in Utah’s solar industry.\As Utah’s monopoly utility provider, Rocky Mountain Power has the ability to shift our state’s energy use to be both cost effective and environmentally and socially responsible. The company needs to do more to follow through on its past environmental commitments.\As a young person who will have to live with the consequences of energy choices made today, I plead with the Utah Public Service commissioners and Rocky Mountain Power President Gary Hoogeveen to ensure rooftop solar is a part of Utah’s future and available for future homeowners like me.\Piper Christian is a lifelong Utah resident and a Public Voices fellow of the OpEd Project and the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.

266,"In 2002, Salt Lake City hosted the highly watched, successful Winter Olympics, and we are praised internationally for our continued maintenance of sports venues. In fact, the Deseret News recently reported Utah Sports Commission President and CEO Jeff Robbins saying Salt Lake City remains ""ready, willing and able"" to host another Olympics by maintaining the 2002 competition facilities and holding many national and international sporting events.\If we truly want to look toward a possible Salt Lake Winter Games in 2020, we need to remember that these venues are nothing without snow. If Utah wants to host future Olympic Games, we need to not only maintain our facilities, but our snowpack, too. A recent peer-reviewed study on climate change suggests a grim outcome for ski resorts if we don't take greater strides to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Fortunately, there are steps we can take to reduce our own carbon footprints - like installing rooftop solar - to reduce climate impacts on winter recreation. But we need the Utah Public Service Commission's help.\Rocky Mountain Power's recent proposed changes to net metering rates and additional fees for solar customers is a step backward in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Utahns are trying to do their part for air quality and the climate, and this proposal drastically limits important, affordable options to reduce the carbon pollution that causes climate change.\As an Olympic athlete who has traveled the world to compete, I have witnessed the impacts of climate change firsthand. In Vancouver, organizers had to helicopter snow from higher elevations to some of the race venues. In Sochi, we had six days where the temperatures were above 60 degrees. The changes to our winters are undeniable, and I want to see my home state lead by investing in clean energy to protect our snowpack. I urge Rocky Mountain Power and the Utah Public Service Commission to think long-term about our state and the 110,000 people whose jobs depend upon the estimated $12.3 billion outdoor recreation industry that is so important to our economy.\Ski resorts across the state are taking ambitious steps to reduce their carbon footprints, which is in line with countless Utahns who are doing the same. Even municipalities are weighing in: the town of Park City, home to our state's Olympic training facilities, has voted to go 100 percent renewable by 2032. Salt Lake City has done the same. But Rocky Mountain Power is making this more difficult for these leading businesses and municipalities.\The energy decisions we make today will have lasting consequences not only on Salt Lake's future for hosting Olympic Games, but more importantly on Utah's air, economy, health and environment. Let's invest in the future of Utah by allowing solar adoption to thrive.\Ted Ligety\Member of the U.S. Ski Team and two-time gold medalist"

SALT LAKE CITY - There is wasted energy under the streets of Salt Lake City. Lots of it. And for decades, it's been deliberately dissipated. But now, city planners are taking steps to harness the energy and put it to good use.
\
In what city officials say is the first project of its kind in Utah, the Salt Lake City Public Utilities Department plans to install microturbines to generate electricity from rushing water inside municipal water pipes.
\
""Yes, we can do this project,"" Public Utilities Director Jeff Niermeyer said, explaining that the electricity will be sold to Rocky Mountain Power. ""It will pencil out.""
\
Because of its topography, Salt Lake City is especially well-suited to an idea that has been around for decades, planners said. Water running downhill packs a punch and carries potential energy as it descends from higher elevations.
\
When water is stored behind a dam, it's capable of generating large amounts of electricity by falling through big pipes called penstocks and spinning enormous hydroelectric turbines.
\
""Our water has been falling down the foothills in this pipe and has developed a lot of potential energy,"" Niermeyer said as he pointed to a concrete blockhouse at the intersection of 500 South and 1000 East.
\
At that point, a buried pipeline drops sharply as it descends the steep terrain on the city's east side.
\
When the door to the blockhouse is opened, the sound of rushing water is almost deafening.
\
""Rushing water being squeezed through some plates,"" Niermeyer explained.
\
The plates are inside two large pressure-reducing valves that are more than a half-century old. They're actually designed to squeeze the energy out of the falling water and dissipate it to reduce pressure.
\
""We have to keep the pressure reasonable in our system so we don't end up blowing up pipelines and creating flooding and issues like that,"" Niermeyer said.
\
That means potential hydroelectricity is being wasted at 57 locations in the city where water runs downhill and where the city has pressure-reducing valves.
\
""Each of those, to some degree, offers an opportunity to produce power at those locations,"" Niermeyer said.
\
Rocky Mountain Power spokesman David Eskelsen said the company is not aware of any utility in the state that has tried to generate hydroelectric power inside water pipes. Such projects are underway in two cities in Oregon.
\
Salt Lake City expects to build its first facility later this year at the 1000 East location. Water in a 36-inch pipe will flow through two microturbines that will spin at high speed to generate electricity.
\
""I think we can generate ... 190 kilowatt hours,"" Niermeyer said, ""which is really equivalent to enough power to produce power for 92 homes.""
\
The project on 1000 East will cost nearly $1 million. But most of that money would have been spent anyway to update the aging pressure-reduction valves.
\
That facility is strategically positioned close to power lines, which means the city can efficiently sell the electricity to Rocky Mountain Power. The other 56 locations may not work out financially unless Rocky Mountain Power modifies its rate structure, which is not especially favorable to small, alternative energy projects.
\
In a pricing structure that is analogous to retail vs. wholesale prices, Rocky Mountain Power buys electricity from small producers at a lower rate than what its customers have to pay when they buy electricity from Rocky Mountain Power.
\
The company's rates, approved by the Utah Public Service Commission, are based on the theory that the cost of power lines and distribution facilities have to be factored into its retail sales price.
\
Niermeyer hopes there will eventually be more flexibility in the rate structure once the first microturbine project proves itself.
\
""What we're hoping is that this demonstrates our ability to do what's called 'virtual net metering,' where you produce it at one location and get credit for it at another location,"" he said. ""And that will open up a whole bunch more other projects.
\
""I think there's a real consensus now in progressive communities like Salt Lake,"" Niermeyer said, ""that we really need to look at how we can produce energy sustainably and reduce our overall impact on the environment.""

Once enacted it could go up,"" said Mark Walton of Creative Energies, a Salt Lake City firm that designs and installs photovoltaic systems.\As a regulated monopoly, however, RMP is obligated to ensure customers who incur costs to the system pay for those costs, company officials say. Net-metered customers evade those costs because they substantially lower their utility bills by producing much of their own power, according to utility spokesman Dave Eskelsen.\""The main issue is one of fairness for all residential customers,"" Eskelsen said. ""Customers who don't use this technology are subsidizing those that do and that's not fair. They simply don't understand the rate-making mechanics that make this rate structure change necessary.""\Critics of the proposal say RMP ignores the extensive benefits net-metered customers provide the utility and its grid by helping it avoid costs associated with peak-load power generation and wear and tear on the transmission equipment. Rep. Patrice Arent, D-Millcreek, said a bill enacted last session requires the PSC to consider costs and benefits solar-powered customers bring to the grid before setting a fee.\Eskelsen contends fee critics overstate those benefits because peak solar production does not coincide with peak demand.\Regardless of net metering's effects on RMP's bottom line, the utility's critics say society and the environment will reap huge benefits as more homeowners install solar arrays. This monopoly company, they say, should not get in the way of progress toward cleaner air and reduced carbon emissions, linked to climate change.\Continuing to rely on coal is a breach of our ""fiduciary duty"" to take care of national resources for future generations, said Mark Thomas, representing the Mormon Environmental Stewardship Alliance, or MESA. The alliance includes concerned members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but it does not represent the Utah-based faith.\""It's a social-justice issue,"" said Pastor Jean Schwien of Salt Lake City's Christ United Methodist Church. ""We are essentially punishing people who do the right thing to switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy.""\bmaffly@sltrib.com\Credit: By Brian Maffly The Salt Lake Tribune"
271,"In a tiny showroom of twisted light bulbs, energy entrepreneur Paul Isom is going gangbusters for green.\He speaks of wax-covered refrigerator thermostats, pinkie-sized fluorescent bulbs that need no ballast and energy adapters that can make a drinking fountain, escalator and even a rock crusher run more efficiently.\""There are two types of green,"" Isom said. ""The green for the environment and the green for your pocket. This accomplishes both.""\As Salt Lake County touts an environmental agenda sprinkled with rooftop solar panels and a mayoral pledge to cut government's energy and water use 20 percent, Isom is chasing the green dream as founder of sEnergy Technologies - the South Salt Lake-based energy-savings shop at 3780 S. West Temple that organized the Lights Off Utah initiative last fall. \The company whittles watts from street lamps, air conditioners and freezers. It also boasts light bulbs that burn brighter at a fraction of the cost and markets innovations such as the eCube thermostat (encased in wax) that mimic food temperature rather than air temperature to keep a refrigerator from turning on too often.\""They are definitely progressive and committed to energy efficiency,"" said Sarah Wright, executive director of the advocacy alliance Utah Clean Energy.\""They aren't just doing this as a way to make a living, but because they are passionate about it,"" she said.\Although sEnergy's products undoubtedly meet environmental muster, its approach has less to do with saving the planet than with shaving power bills. \Its compact fluorescent bulbs can generate a 1,000-watt glow at just a third of the power. Its energy adapters make a refrigerator up to 25 percent more efficient by more closely regulating its electrical flow. Its finger-thin T5 fluorescent bulbs (slipped into a reflective sleeve that can operate without a ballast) can provide the same lighting with 60 percent less energy than a larger T12 fixture.\""We are looking to put Utah on the map for energy-saving technologies,"" said Spencer Freedman, vice president of sales and marketing. \Salt Lake County already is moving in that direction with plans to cover its libraries, office buildings and even the Salt Palace Convention Center with solar arrays.\Mayor Peter Corroon has announced efforts to retrofit government buildings with energy-efficient equipment and to require any new construction to meet green-building standards.\The Clark Planetarium has become a county poster child for change, having cut its energy use almost 10 percent by changing light bulbs, turning off computers and setting its exhibits on timers. A rooftop solar energy system is planned for the star shop this summer.\That's just the beginning. Legislation is afoot at the state Capitol to offer financial incentives to environmentally minded home builders, tax credits for purchasers of low-pollution vehicles and greater size allowances for privately installed solar and wind systems.\""It just makes sense,"" Wright said. ""We are starting to get smart about energy and realizing that our fossil resources aren't infinite.""\jstettler@sltrib.com \Power bills \Utah lawmakers will consider several green initiatives this legislative session, including the following:\* Incentive for highly efficient homes and retrofits: Would provide a financial perk for builders to exceed Utah's existing energy code in constructing new homes. The bill also would reward people who retrofit their homes with energy-efficient windows, insulation, boilers and air-conditioning units.\* Clean-vehicle tax credit: HB106 would provide tax credits for residents who buy a low-emissions vehicle or convert an existing automobile to run on an alternative fuel such as natural gas.\* Renewable-Energy Development Zones Task Force: Would identify areas and strategies for expanding wind, solar, geothermal and biomass power generation. \* Net metering amendment: Would allow Utahns to connect larger solar, wind and renewable-energy systems to the power grid. The move would enable Salt Lake County to install a 1.8-megawatt solar array atop the Salt Palace and provide for comparable commercial systems.\Note: Not all bills have been numbered yet.\Source: Utah Clean Energy\Credit: By Jeremiah Stettler The Salt Lake Tribune"
272,"\The Deseret News recently interviewed me for a story on my family’s decision to embrace clean energy products, including an electric vehicle, EV home charger and solar panels. As I read the comments on the article and on social media, I noticed several of them mirrored my prior misperceptions about “going clean” that I held before doing some research.\In an effort to clear the air, I wanted to share three of the biggest misconceptions I had before my family invested in clean energy.\Myth 1: My family can’t afford an electric vehicle or solar panels \My husband and I initially thought we would have to spend tens of thousands of dollars before we could make changes that would benefit the environment.\Our first realization that this wasn’t the case was when we were in the market for another car. We weren’t even looking for an EV, but my husband was browsing KSL Classifieds and came upon a used Nissan Leaf with less than 10,000 miles for only around $10,000. While new EVs are still pricey, we couldn’t believe what a bargain used ones were going for! We bought it, and our EV has quickly become our favorite car for commuting and running errands around town. If your family has more than one car, having an inexpensive, clean vehicle to use for the majority of your local driving can have a big impact, even if you have to use a gas-powered car for some longer trips.\Our second realization occurred a few months ago after speaking with a friend who worked for Vivint Solar. He shared how we could pay for our panels over time with an affordable monthly payment and also told us about the opportunity to bundle a rooftop solar system from Vivint Solar with an EV charging station from ChargePoint. For no money down, we were able to install solar panels on our roof and an EV charger in our garage. For a low fixed cost each month, we can now generate our energy and charge our EV at a much faster rate. While every family’s financial situation is different, we were surprised by how attainable these products are for everyday Utahns.\Myth 2: Solar takes forever to begin paying dividends on your investment\Once the panels were installed on our roof, the savings began quickly. Even in winter, we pay less per month for electricity. In fact, the combined cost of our monthly loan payment and utility bill is less than what we previously paid for electricity.\Our power bill is lower because we use less power from the grid. In addition, net metering with Rocky Mountain Power means that we get credit for any extra power we generate that we don’t use, further lowering our bill. As power rates go up over time our savings will grow as well since the cost of our system remains fixed.\Myth 3: One person can’t make a difference in improving our air quality\Salt Lake City has the dubious distinction of being ranked seventh on the American Lung Association’s top 10 list of most polluted cities in the country. Breathing polluted air is a serious risk to Utahns’ health. The medical evidence is overwhelming. Even short-term exposure to air pollution harms our health. Air pollution increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer, and it contributes to shorter lifespans. Each year my patients complain of asthma exacerbations and a host of breathing problems due to our air pollution.\Vehicle emissions account for roughly 50 percent of local air pollution, so driving a zero-emission vehicle is a great way to make a difference in your immediate air shed at the local level. Solar also helps reduce the amount of electricity you use from the grid. Individual actions can make a major collective impact in improving the air quality in our communities.\Transitioning to cleaner energy has been an illuminating experience for us. I’ve realized many of the assumptions I had about this process were off the mark. It has been a much simpler – and more affordable – step for our family than we expected. For anyone on the fence about going solar or driving an electric vehicle (or both!), I would recommend taking some EVs for a test drive and getting some bids on solar panel systems.\Advances in technology have made EVs and solar energy cost-effective options for many Utahns. It’s a great time to invest in cleaner options, support Utah’s economy, improve our air quality and put money back in your pocket.\CREDIT: Suzanne Harrison, Deseret News Hive"
273,"Utah's fierce-if-wonky debate over rooftop solar resumed this week before the Public Service Commission, which heard three days of expert testimony and public comment on costs and benefits associated with Rocky Mountain Power's net-metered customers.\This small, but growing, number of ratepayers reduce their utility bills by generating excess power when the sun is out, which they get credited for when they draw power at night.\Utah's largest utility says its solar-equipped customers are mooching off the system by not covering their share of the electrical grid's fixed costs.\But an independent study commissioned by proponents of renewable energy found that every dollar invested in rooftop solar results in a benefit worth $12 to $24 for all the utility's customers. This is because such ""distributed power generation"" reduces the need to build costly centralized power stations in the future, according to an analysis conducted by Synapse Energy Economics.\""Utility energy efficiency programs [by contrast] generally have a benefit of $1.50 to $3.50 for every $1 invested. You don't have to be a fan of clean energy to see the economic benefit here,"" said Sarah Wright of Utah Clean Energy, which commissioned the study to advance its case that the Public Service Commission (PSC) should not impose surcharges or higher rates on net-metered customers.\On Tuesday, Synapse principal Tim Woolf explained how his study assumed 1 percent of RMP customers will install rooftop solar each year for a decade, making 10 percent of customers net-metered by 2024. This move would avoid costs for the utility totaling $287 million to $1.2 billion, costs that would otherwise have been passed onto ratepayers, Woolf said.\But utility spokesman Dave Eskelsen, citing experts retained by the state, contends the study was rigged to produce predetermined conclusions.\The rooftop solar debate ignited two years ago when Rocky Mountain Power (RMP) sought to impose a $4.35 monthly surcharge on net-metered customers.

The latter would have a devastating negative impact on Utah's solar future,"" Wright said. The Sierra Club and the industry group Alliance for Solar Choice joined Wright's group in presenting formal arguments in support of rooftop solar's value.\Calculating the benefits of distributed solar has been a tricky and contentious exercise in social arithmetic.\Solar proponents insist regulators should consider avoided costs, reduced emissions, innovation and reduced wear on the grid.\The utility believes the benefits that count are the ones that can be counted. Many of the benefits cited by solar backers are speculative or defy measurement, Eskelsen said.

274,"
Kyle Christensen moved to Utah last spring from a community in California where solar power was big. He wanted to bring that energy mindset to his company Western Botanicals Inc., which pulled up stakes on the West Coast in 2006 for a cheaper home in Spanish Fork.
\
""I was kind of turned on by the fact that you could do alternative energy and it could save you real money,"" said Christensen. He is co-owner of the $3 million business with fewer than 20 employees who help manufacture and distribute herbal medicines for Western Botanicals.
\
Christensen sold his business partner Randy Giboney on the idea of putting up wind turbines on site that would provide clean energy and help defray his company's power costs. Their ideal setup would mean being able to tie into the area's existing utility grid, but there's been no quick trip to that end.
\
""It's not as simple as people want to make it,"" said Spanish Fork Mayor Joe Thomas.
\
The process of tying into the grid has to go through the Utah Municipal Power Agency, which for years has provided electricity to six cities in Utah County, including Spanish Fork, via several sources in and around Utah, including coal-fired power plants and the Glen Canyon Dam.
\
""We encourage wind turbines,"" said UMPA general manager Leon Pexton. He said demand to tie into UMPA lines is only beginning to surface. ""We're just starting to work through that issue.""
\
In addition to needing time to figure out how tying in to UMPA's lines would work, Thomas said other issues needing resolutions include determining whether turbines would be a noise nuisance and whether they're installed on the user's land. ""It can't be ugly,"" Thomas added.
\
Pexton said UMPA member cities would need to resolve any issues with their business strategy in the context of contracts that require them to buy power from UMPA. ""That's not insurmountable,"" he said. ""That's done a lot.""
\
Christensen and Giboney have been encouraged by the new Spanish Fork Canyon Wind Farm project, with its nine-turbine, 19-megawatt utility-scale system that can deliver enough electricity to PacifCorp to power 6,000 homes. But the city doesn't buy any of the farm's relatively expensive power, which gets routed elsewhere outside the city.
\
UMPA, however, sells power to the California-based farm's owner Edison Mission Group Inc. when the wind isn't blowing and the huge turbines aren't turning, which means the farm can't provide its own electricity to run essential equipment.
\
""It's really the right thing to do,"" Thomas said about at least being host to Utah's first large wind farm. ""We're doing our share.""
\
For Western Botanicals' owners, Spanish Fork hasn't acted quickly enough to accommodate the business, which will first need a change in the city's ordinance to even put up a pole for one turbine.
\
""We're still fighting,"" Christensen said. ""It's going to happen -- it's not a matter of if, it's when.""
\
Now a report released this month urges policymakers to get on board with community-based wind power.
\
The report is called ""Community Wind 101: A Primer for Policymakers,"" put out by the groups Harvesting Clean Energy, 25x'25 America's Energy Future and The Energy Foundation. They say that developing wind energy sources at all levels ""will require modernizing and expanding transmission systems to carry power from remote windy areas to cities.""
\
The nonprofit 25x'25's goal is to see this country get 25 percent of its energy from renewable sources like wind, solar and biofuels by 2025.
\
""In places where transmission is currently limited, community wind with its typically smaller scale can be developed to serve local needs,"" reads a summary of their report.
\
The three groups go on to say that a ""favorable"" policy environment, with attention to tax incentives, is needed to overcome high startup costs. They hold up Minnesota as an example of a wind-friendly state, pointing out how that state has offered smaller-scale wind producers ""production incentives, guaranteed markets, standardized legal agreements, capital support and other assistance.""
\
The report can be found at www.harvestcleanenergy.org/wind/CommWind.htm.
\
The Western Botanicals owners want to put up as many as three turbines on 45-foot poles on their property that includes less than an acre of land in an industrial area. They've determined that the best energy-producing winds come during the evening.
\
Tying into the local utility grid would mean all of that energy being produced while they're not around at night would be transmitted into the grid for public consumption. In effect, depending upon the volume of their own power consumption, the tie-in would generate credits toward their overall power bill through so-called ""net metering"" if they use less power than they're producing.
\
The Western Botanicals owners have so far been advised to purchase batteries to store electricity for private consumption at the business. That idea would be fine as a backup power source if the grid failed, Christensen added, but overall he's against essentially being forced (if he can't tie into the grid) to buy batteries with a shelf life that would mean needing to replace them every five or 10 years. He wants access to the grid.
\
Utah-based West Mountain Wind Power owner/installer Steve Painter is a dealer for Southwest Wind Power. He is installing more and more small wind systems at homes and businesses at roughly $10,000 each in Idaho, Wyoming, Washington, Oregon and Utah. Painter's systems are designed for integration with existing grids.
\
His business is benefiting from a greater acceptance of cities to allow small-scale wind projects, in particular those that get grid access. Painter's concern is that cities like Spanish Fork will come up with policies that are too prohibitive to homeowners or small business owners who want to jump into the wind market.
\
""Don't make a policy so no one can use it,"" Painter warned.
\
In the meantime, Giboney is anxious for action from Spanish Fork officials. The goal, he noted, is not to make money off of wind power.
\
""I'm doing it because it's the right thing to do,"" Giboney said. That, and it will knock ""a few hundred bucks"" off his utility bill each month, which can add up to long-term savings for a small company originally attracted to Spanish Fork from California for a cheaper place to do business.

275,"Provo Mayor John Curtis says he intends to veto a controversial fee the Municipal Council last week approved imposing on electrical customers who have installed solar panels on their homes.\The $3-per-kilowatt Solar Generation Capacity Charge amounts to an $18 monthly surcharge on a typical solar array, which proponents say is needed to ensure ""net-metered"" customers pay their share of the electrical grid's many fixed costs.\But Curtis contends the fee ccc approved Oct. 4 on a 4-3 vote ccc sends the wrong message, one that could discourage residential use of solar, and needs additional work.\""It has been a difficult decision because the council was well-intentioned,"" Curtis said Tuesday. ""It cast an aspersion on the way Provo views solar and early adopters. Those people who make that early investment paved the way for the rest of us to follow at a reduced price. We need people to continue to invest in solar.""\Around the state, utilities and cities are grappling with this issue in light of rooftop solar's growth, spurred by tax incentives, rebates and the practice of net-metering ccc which big utilities, but not municipal power systems, are required to accommodate. Net-metered customers get to pipe their excess electricity into the grid during peak generation at mid-day, then get a unit-for-unit credit when they need to draw power.\Rocky Mountain Power, Utah's largest utility, contends this arrangement enables net-metered customers to shift the burden of fixed costs to those without solar, and has been petitioning the Utah Public Service Commission for permission to impose a surcharge on its growing ranks of solar customers.\St. George and Santa Clara were the first Utah cities to impose such a fee, but these cities partially excuse existing installations and credit the first few kilowatts. Residential systems are typically six or seven kilowatts and much of their output is consumed in the home, so it never even hits the grid. Kaysville has been crafting a fee for the past year and its city council is expected to weight alternatives at its Oct. 20 meeting.\Those three cities are members of the Utah Association of Municipal Power Systems, while Provo belongs to the six-city Utah Municipal Power Agency, whose five other members are also considering solar fees.\There is broad consensus that some kind of surcharge is in order, since solar customers still rely on the electrical grid which is funded by electrical rates. The controversy hinges on what amount is equitable considering the ability of rooftop solar to improve air quality, reduce dependence on fossil fuels and related climate-altering carbon emissions, and reduce wear and tear on the grid.\The Provo fee ignores societal benefits and was crafted with minimal public participation, said Sarah Wright, executive director of Utah Clean Energy. This group and its allies argue a rate redesign must account for public health and environmental benefits of offsetting coal-fired power, not just the cost advantages reaped by solar users.\""We are delighted that Provo will take a second look. The fundamental problem was Provo Power was prepared to impose an onerous surcharge without looking at both sides of the story,"" said Matt Pacenza of HEAL Utah. ""It is important that any city take their time and think carefully of the overall grid and the costs and benefits of solar.""\At least 27 Provo residents spoke in opposition to the fee as proposed at the council's Oct. 4 meeting, none in favor.\Jonathan Hill, a biology professor who is weighing whether to put solar on his home, told the council it was neglecting key policy implications by penalizing solar customers.\""This year is setting up to be the hottest year on record once again. Over the summer we got a quarter-inch of rain. We got nothing. We've had algae blooms and environmental impacts. To deny that our environment is not being impact by our existence here is foolish,"" said Hill. He calculated that every kilowatt-hour of coal-fired power that is displaced by solar results in a societal benefit worth 10 cents, about what Provo pays to subsidize solar by purchasing it from net-metered customers at a retail rate.\""It is not that the solar owners are taking all these benefits for themselves. These benefits are shared by the community. To ask the community to help subsidize this cost is not unfair,"" Hill said.\Others feared the fee would undermine technological innovation and make Provo a less attractive place to invest in.\Provo residents have been slow to embrace rooftop solar; half a percent of its 37,000 customers are currently net-metered. According to a Provo Power report, 162 homes were net-metered at the end of June, expected to grow to 240 by year's end.\But with dropping costs, Utah's ample availability of sunlight and solar companies aggressively selling and leasing rooftop arrays, Curtis and others expect solar use to increase at ""an exponential"" rate, and any rate restructure should be based on the assumption that 15 percent or more of homes will soon be solar-equipped.\The mayor proposes putting together a commission that ""would recognize all the competing goals, that is preserving the grid and promoting solar. I think we can find a balance.""\The council's bill authorizing the fee has not reached Curtis' desk, so he has yet to actually apply the veto. It would be his first to be made in opposition to the seven-member council in his seven years as mayor. One earlier veto came at the request of the council.\The council could override his veto, but that appears unlikely ccc it would require five votes, and the fee garnered only four to begin with. One of those aye votes came from a council member who welcomes Curtis' push to improve the fee.\""I recognize the challenge Mayor Curtis is having right now. I have the same challenge. I have great faith in solar. I believe it's part of our energy solutions,"" Gary Winterton said. ""I also believe that it is not free. I am willing subsidize solar to some degree, but I am concerned that citizens will get the idea that they can tear up their electric bill by putting solar on their roof.""\Brian Maffly covers public lands for The Salt Lake Tribune.

And the sun.\ ""If the American public really understood the environmental impact of our electricity generation and if you put a cost to that, a lot of our [alternative] energy sources would be comparable to the conventional ones,"" said Steve Hester, technical director for the Solar Electric Power Association in Washington, D.C.\ Alternative, or renewable, energy sources -- which also include biomass, geothermal and hydropower -- provide about 7.5 percent of current U.S. energy demand, up only slightly from 6 percent in 1990.\ The most promising sources of clean new energy in this state are wind power and solar energy.\ Combined with conservation, these sources could meet Utah's projected increase in electrical demand for the next 10 years.\ CONSERVATION\ A megawatt saved is money in the bank\ In 1960, the average American consumed 252 million BTUs of energy. Today, that figure is around 350 million BTUs, mainly because we live in bigger homes, drive more miles and depend on more electrically powered gadgets than ever before.\ Though Americans represent just 5 percent of the world's population, they account for 25 percent of global energy consumption.\ Surely there is room to cut back.\ So when Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt announced this month his strategy for meeting Utah's energy demand, he pledged to ""cultivate an ethic of conservation and energy efficiency.""\ Though the governor has yet to formulate a specific plan, he knows the potential for saving electricity is significant and cost- effective.\ A new report prepared by the Boston-based Tellus Institute for the Utah Public Service Commission concluded there are close to 700 megawatts of power that could be saved in the next five years through an intensive investment in energy efficiency and conservation measures. (A megawatt is enough electricity to power about 1,000 homes.)\ That 700-megawatt potential from conservation is more than four times the power that would be generated by a new, $100 million natural-gas-fired plant on the fast track for construction in West Valley City.\ ""There is enormous opportunity to offset the need to build [new power plants] through energy efficiency and conservation,"" said Jeff Burke, director of the Utah Office of Energy and Resource Planning.\ The conservation measures explored in the Tellus report focus on saving electricity with proven technologies. It suggests more efficient lighting in businesses and homes, retrofitting cooling systems, improving the use of electric motors in manufacturing plants and overall better management of peak electrical demand.\ WIND\ Other energy sources hoarded when it blows\ Harnessing the wind to generate electricity seems an ideal solution to Utah's power woes.\ Put up a windmill. Wait for a breeze to blow and the juice will flow. It is clean, the power is relatively cheap, and the impact on the environment, compared to a coal-fired power plant, is near zero.\ New equipment developed in recent years -- more efficient blades and turbines -- make wind power more reliable than ever, said A. Craig Hansen, a former mechanical engineering professor at the University of Utah who now runs Windward Engineering, a consulting firm in Holladay.\ ""Wind power is booming in other areas of the country,"" Hansen said.\ Traditional utilities are getting behind the effort.\ In January, Pacificorp, the parent company of Utah Power, joined with wind-power developer FPL Energy of Florida to begin construction near the Oregon-Washington border on what will be the world's largest wind farm, said Dave Eskelsen, Utah Power spokesman. The 450 wind turbines planned for the ""Stateline"" site eventually will generate 300 megawatts of electricity. Utah consumers eventually will receive some of that power.\ Pacificorp also operates its Foote Creek wind farm near Laramie, Wyo. The facility has 69 turbines that generate 41 megawatts of electricity.\ Compared with other states such as Wyoming, Texas and Oregon, there is a lack of quality wind-power sites in Utah, said Dave Lochtefeld, an energy engineer at the Utah Office of Energy and Resource Planning.\ Still, given the right circumstances and monetary incentives, the potential for wind-power development in Utah is considerable, said Sarah Wright of Utahns for an Energy Efficient Economy.\ There is 2,000 megawatts of wind power potential within Utah's borders, Wright said, pointing to U.S. Department of Energy figures. Today, wind power is ""increasingly cost-competitive with conventional fossil fuel-fired resources, particularly given rising natural gas prices,"" she said.\ For all the benefits that wind power can bring to Utah's energy portfolio, it is far from a panacea, mainly because it is an intermittent power source.\ ""Wind power is best looked upon as a fuel saver,"" said Hansen. When the wind is blowing, utilities can reduce their use of coal, natural gas and hydropower.\ SOLAR\ Sunshine is free but harvesting it is costly\ During the energy crisis in the 1970s, many consumers looked skyward. Sales of solar panels for heat and electricity soared.\ The bubble burst, however, a few years later as solar energy systems leaked and broke down.\ The solar power association's Hester said times have changed. ""There is a wealth of improvements"" in solar-energy systems today, thanks to federal standards developed by the U.S. Department of Energy, he said.\ Unfortunately, solar energy has yet to enjoy a renaissance. Less than 1 percent of U.S. energy demand is met by the sun.\ In Utah, about 3 megawatts of solar power are in use.\ During the past few years, the state and federal government have built 300 kilowatts of solar-electric applications at state and national parks, most notably the 160-kilowatt solar plant at Dangling Rope Marina on Lake Powell.\ The state's current solar capacity is mere static in the 1,800 to 3,000 megawatts of new electrical capacity the state will need in the next 10 years.\ But the potential for solar in the future is ""enormous,"" said Burke. ""You don't need to do any studies. Anybody who owns a rooftop can put a solar system up. The only limitations are economic.""\ The capital cost for photovoltaic cells, which turn sun to voltage, is about $6,000 per kilowatt, compared with $625 per kilowatt for a large natural gas power plant.\ Because of the enormous price to harness the sun for electricity, Utah Power has no solar power plants in its mix, said company spokesman Eskelsen.\ The company, however, donates money to the occasional solar power project and offers expertise to businesses and individuals who install photovoltaic systems.\ To ensure such cooperation continues and to motivate more residents to invest in solar power, Leavitt's office may ask that electric utilities allow ""net metering."" That would permit customers with solar electric units to put their surplus power on the main grid and receive a credit on their power bills."
278," It was a wild ride.\ During the past 6 1/2 weeks, the Winter Olympics triumphantly rolled through town, the U.S. military ran roughshod over the Taliban and the Republicans in Utah's Legislature dominated the political landscape.\ Legislation authored by Republicans will put ""In God We Trust"" posters in every Utah public school, erect gun lockers at all state courthouses, threaten teachers if they delve too deeply into a student's psychology, exact revenge on litigants who challenge state construction projects and codify in a child homicide law the belief that life begins the moment a human egg is fertilized.\ Of 382 bills passed by the House and Senate, 62 were sponsored by Democrats. That's a measly 16 percent of the state's total business, with the minority party making up 31 percent of the Legislature's 104 members.\ Critics blamed the GOP's political stranglehold for a raft of bills that seemed designed mainly to punish or to warn.\ Through legislation and budget trimming, lawmakers targeted individuals -- notably Gov. Mike Leavitt, University of Utah President Bernie Machen and Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson -- and agencies such as the Division of Child and Family Services, as well as unions such as the Utah Education Association.\ Republican House Speaker Marty Stephens began the Olympics- shortened session by exhorting lawmakers to ""First, do no harm."" Aside from an innocuous bill designating official state vegetables, it seemed that advice was lost in the commotion.\ Faced with a combined $300 million shortfall in fiscal years 2002 and 2003, legislators slashed budgets. But millions of dollars were restored to programs in the session's final days, as lawmakers agreed to dip into the state's emergency fund to the tune of $45 million and pulled millions more from highway and construction accounts.\ Tense over the sinking economy, tempers sometimes flared. Spanish Fork Republican Rep. Glenn Way called what one of Leavitt's analysts had to say ""so much crap."" Rep. Katherine Bryson, R-Orem, called proposed cuts to higher education ""asinine.""\ Level heads didn't necessarily prevail.\ Stymied over changes he wanted to make to the state's child abuse database, West Jordan Republican Sen. Chris Buttars introduced a measure that would do away with the list. But he compromised later, after much haggling over the estimated cost to the state.\ Advocates for private school tax relief and gun rights threatened lawmakers who didn't kowtow to demands -- causing a backlash when the shoving became too hard.\ Utah's 2002 session will be remembered as much for its pomp as its production.\ Lawmakers passed scores of legally meaningless but heartfelt resolutions honoring Olympic athletes, Olympic volunteers, Olympic leaders, U.S. military personnel, Utah's hawkish U.S. Rep. Jim Hansen, who is retiring, President George W. Bush, Congress and Gold and Blue Star Mothers.\ Through resolution, they also honored a Shakespearean, a princess, steelworkers, Navajos and homeless advocate Pamela Atkinson.\ Following is a summary of what the 2002 Legislature did, or did not do, in various areas:\ LEAVITT VS. LEGISLATURE\ Somehow Leavitt emerged unscathed from a legislative session where lawmakers seemed all but certain to roll him on budget issues and shrink the powers of his office.\ How did he do it?\ The Senate, which generally is more staid and predictable than the conservative-activist House, saved the governor's bacon on several griddles.\ Senate leaders were the first to cave to Leavitt's insistence that a $256 million shortfall could not be fixed with spending cuts alone. Lawmakers ultimately compromised and agreed to raid the state emergency fund and construction and highway accounts for cash.\ The Senate also killed not one, but two proposed constitutional amendments that would have taken away Leavitt's exclusive power to call a legislative special session by also giving lawmakers that authority. It also snuffed a separate bill that would have significantly curtailed Leavitt's flexibility in managing state budget shortfalls by prohibiting him from tinkering with deficits greater than $50 million.\ When the session began Jan. 21, lawmakers were angry Leavitt had refused to call them into special session to deal with the budget crisis. It seemed a foregone conclusion the proposals to curb his authority would pass. But after the measures overwhelmingly passed the House, they were stopped cold in the Senate.\ The same fate befell an ethics-reform bill unanimously passed in the House that was aimed at curbing Leavitt's ravenous fund-raising appetite. For the second year in a row, the Senate killed without debate the proposed ban on political donations to the governor during the legislative session and the 20-day period afterward when he decides whether to sign or veto bills.\ -- Dan Harrie\ COURTS\ The court system is now faced with the task of reducing its budget of $101 million for the current fiscal year by $3.4 million for fiscal year 2003, which begins July 1.\ That means eliminating 71 positions, including deputy clerks, deputy probation officers, court reporters and employees of the Administrative Office of the Courts. Although the budget crunch has produced the most significant reduction in staff the courts have seen in recent years, it should not mean mass layoffs, said Court Administrator Dan Becker.\ Forty-one positions were already vacant or have been phased out due to a hiring freeze that has been in effect since September, Becker sai d. The hiring freeze will continue. And new jobs being created by the opening of Salt Lake City's Justice Court in July should give those whose positions are eliminated another place to go, he said.\ The courts have already taken steps to cut costs in the current fiscal year, including relocating probation officers into state- owned facilities to save money on leases. Two judgeships will be reallocated from 3rd District Court, one of them moving to the 3rd District Juvenile Court and another to the 5th District, which covers Beaver, Iron and Washington counties.\ -- Elizabeth Neff\ ENVIRONMENT\ Environmentalists joined with Box Elder County residents to persuade lawmakers to scratch two dams from a state list of possible Bear River water development projects.\ Honeyville and the Amalga Barrens area of Elwood sought the measure because those dams would have inundated parts of the communities. Environmentalists were relieved because removing the dams from a list of seven under consideration would save wetlands and wildlife.\ Lawmakers also passed resolutions urging the federal government to remove radioactive uranium-mill tailings from the edge of the Colorado River north of Moab and asking Congress to offer funding to research and develop technologies that would make Utah coal more marketable. They trimmed more than $5 million from the loan programs communities use to repair and improve their sewer and drinking-water programs.\ Senators disappointed anti-nuclear activists by abandoning a resolution backing Nevada in a fight against a national nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain.\ The Nevada site's fate is linked to a high-level nuclear waste storage facility proposed for the Skull Valley Goshute Indian Reservation, 45 miles from Salt Lake City. By remaining silent on the issue, lawmakers sided with strategists who believe the best way to keep the power plant waste out of Utah is to speed it to Nevada.\ Sen. Gene Davis, D-Salt Lake City, said the bill died because of Leavitt. ""He doesn't even want it discussed,"" Davis said.\ -- Judy Fahys\ ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\ In a difficult budget year, Utah's economic developers are happy they received any money from the Legislature at all.\ The Utah Industrial Assistance Fund -- the backbone of the state's economic development effort -- ended the legislative session with an infusion of $7 million for its 2003 fiscal year.\ The fund offers financial incentives in the form of grants to companies that agree to expand or relocate to Utah and add high- paying jobs. Economic developers and Leavitt have emphasized the fund's importance in their renewed efforts to lure more high-tech jobs to the state. The grants are awarded by a panel made up largely of private-sector business people.\ The state's division of Business and Economic Development, whose employees administer the Industrial Assistance Fund, was allocated $8.4 million by the Legislature, up from $8.1 million in fiscal year 2002, said Robert Fuehr, director of the state Business and Economic Development Division.\ -- Lesley Mitchell\ PUBLIC EDUCATION\ A decade of increased school spending came to an end this session when the Legislature cut $41 million in state funds from Utah's $2.3 billion public education budget. But even after they finished trimming, lawmakers were able to find cash for pet projects.\ Rural districts will pocket $150,000 for scholarships to help teachers obtain subject endorsements or earn master's degrees.\ While Leavitt's proposal to open high-tech high schools found favor with legislators, who set aside $3 million to open six such charter schools, a program aimed at retaining math, science and technology teachers was dramatically slashed. The previous session, lawmakers planned to provide teachers with $2.4 million in scholarships and bonuses, but this year they sliced the fund to $600,000.\ Still, the state's 22,000 teachers will split $5 million -- about $200 each -- to partially reimburse them for purchasing classroom supplies.\ It's a tiny perk in view of the miserly $16 increase -- from $2,116 to $2,132 -- in the state's per-student funding formula. That boost will give districts slightly more money for health insurance or salaries, but school officials say they fear it won't cover anticipated double-digit premium hikes.\ Also, the tiny gain will be offset by slices to block grants that fund items such as school nurses, character education and programs for students who are learning English, having difficulty reading or at-risk of academic failure. Each of the state's 40 districts will make their own decisions on what to cut.\ -- Marta Murvosh\ UTILITIES\ The Legislature flirted briefly with two controversial utility measures during the 2002 session but both matters ended up being referred to interim committees for further study.\ One of the measures, House Bill 140, was designed to help boost competition for residential phone service and would have punished Qwest Communications if it stood in the way.\ The bill, sponsored by House Majority Leader Kevin Garn of Layton, was substituted by another measure that calls for a legislative task force to study whether Qwest's wholesale and retail operations should be separated as a way to encourage residential competition.\ Sen. Ed Mayne, D-West Valley City, suggested early in the session that members of Utah's Public Service Commission be elected rather than appointed by the governor. He quickly determined, however, the issue promised to be controversial and of such importance to consumers that it would be best studied for a year and then brought up in the 2003 session.\ Legislators did pass House Bill 7 -- the so-called ""Net Metering Bill."" The legislation allows Utahns who operate home solar- or wind- power generating systems to sell any excess electricity back to their utility company and receive a credit on their monthly power bills.\ Sparks, however, did fly when legislators passed Senate Bill 29 in the final hours of the session. The bill is designed to make it easier for the Intermountain Power Project near Delta to build a third generating unit. But consumer advocates were concerned because the bill was substituted at the last moment with far more complex legislation that was never fully studied.\ -- Steve Oberbeck\ GUNS\ If the Second Amendment gives every American the right to own a gun, why does Utah tax gun sales? Why must Utahns pay the cost of a criminal background check before they buy a gun or obtain a concealed weapon permit? And why does Utah require that licensed concealed weapon carriers -- all 40,000 of them -- first learn how to handle a firearm before they hide it in a purse or under their coat?\ Utah's pro-gun lobby wants to know. So, lawmakers this year debated measures to wipe away a $7.50 background check fee for sales and a $35 handling fee for concealed weapons permits.\ Both measures failed, but Utah's pro-gun Legislature managed to loosen some other gun laws.\ State employees and foster parents could not be denied the right to bear arms under House Bill 287.\ Under House Bill 82, sponsored by Rep. John Swallow, R-Sandy, Utahns who want to carry a concealed weapon to court can store their weapon inside a taxpayer-funded locker until they finish their business inside.\ Utah's lock-and-load lawmakers failed to punish University of Utah President Bernie Machen for standing by a campus policy banning concealed weapons, although they desperately tried. They did, however, sunset the U.'s policy.\ Gun-control advocates wanted to close a tiny loophole that allows private sales without a background check at traveling gun bazaars but the bill was shot down in committee. They also wanted to wipe out a state law reserving all firearms regulation authority to the Legislature, but that measure was holstered long before it reached a debate.\ Democratic Rep. Scott Daniels of Salt Lake City sponsored both bills. His calls for control were overwhelmed by a storm of pro-gun lobbyists and their new friend, Murray Republican Rep. Morgan Philpot.\ ""Rights should not be taxed,"" Philpot argued. ""When you stray from that principle and regulate one, you invite regulation and infringement on another.""\ While lawmakers ended up with a mixed bag of new gun laws, at least one provision makes it clear that once a Utahn owns a gun, and has paid whatever it costs, he or she can use it to kill ""tumultuous"" intruders without fear of being second-guessed.\ Under HB336, deadly force is justified in defense of persons or property if the force is used to terminate a trespass committed in the attempt of a forcible felony that poses the threat of imminent peril of death or serious injury.\ -- Greg Burton\ PARKS, WILDLIFE\ A $500,000 budget cut will force the Division of Parks and Recreation to lay off at least six full-time employees and close several state parks by July 1.\ The agency also lost $700,000 out of its matching riverway enhancement and nonmotorized trail grant programs, a hit that could stall dozens of city, county and federal projects.\ ""This is the worst Legislature I have ever had,"" said State Parks Director Courtland Nelson.\ Nelson will meet with his staff Monday to begin working out recommendations on which parks to close. Those will be presented to the state Parks Board when it meets in Salt Lake City on March 19.\ The Legislature also scrapped a bill that would have required motorboat operators to pass a safety test and receive a license.\ The Legislature increased fishing license fees by $2. Proceeds will go toward preserving and developing blue ribbon fisheries across the state.\ -- Tom Wharton\ GROWTH\ The state's smart-growth advocates fought a back-and-forth battle with lawmakers to preserve the LeRay McAllister Open Space Fund and the governor's growth-planning budget. In the end, they got a split.\ The Legislature cut $2 million from the McAllister Fund, leaving just $700,000 for the Utah Quality Growth Commission to dole out for open-space grants to communities and property owners.\ However, legislators left intact most of the growth budget, which will allow projects in the pipeline to go forward and retain that part of Leavitt's planning staff.\ Under the circumstances, Leavitt felt it was the best he could do.\ ""This doesn't mean our [smart-growth goal] is abandoned. It just means we're doing all we can this year,"" he said.\ Still, smart-growth proponents were unhappy.\ ""We're grateful the planning budget was left intact, but we're deeply disappointed the McAllister Fund was so deeply reduced,"" said Dave Livermore, director of the Nature Conservancy of Utah. ""T his is a definite step backward for open-space protection.""\ -- Joe Baird\ HUMAN SERVICES\ The Foster Care Citizens Review Board, targeted for total elimination early in the session, wound up being fully funded. The board uses more than 400 volunteers statewide to review foster-care placements.\ Partial funding was restored for the Families, Agencies and Communities Together program (FACT), which also was in danger of being eliminated. The interagency program is aimed at providing services such as counseling, tutoring and medical checkups to low- income families or children with behavioral problems and their families.\ The program's budget was trimmed by about 60 percent, which will impact some services, said Robin Arnold-Williams, executive director of the Department of Human Services. The program is supposed to use its funding to help those with the most critical needs.\ ""If we didn't change anything, we'd run out of money about mid- April,"" Arnold-Williams said. ""We have some decisions to make immediately.""\ Several bills aimed at the state's child welfare system, meanwhile, received approval from lawmakers, some of whom were eager to rein in what they see as a division run amok.\ One bill requires division caseworkers to obtain a warrant before taking children into protective custody, unless certain conditions are met.\ A second bill mandates changes in the way the division maintains a database of accused child abusers used to screen foster parents or child care providers. The division had initial misgivings about that bill but ended up signing off on it after a modified version was drafted.\ -- Ashley E. Broughton\ HIGHER EDUCATION\ The legislative numbers games didn't play well for Utah's colleges and universities.\ Higher education typically takes up 16 percent of the state pie, but received 23 percent of the state budget cuts -- ""more than its fair share,"" argued Sen. Lyle Hillyard, R-Logan, co-chairman of the higher education appropriations subcommittee.\ Lawmakers trimmed $17.5 million from higher education's $587 million budget, leaving it with about $570 million and yet another math puzzle: teach 8 percent more students with 3 percent less money.\ College presidents say the cuts will mean higher tuition next year, crowded classrooms and the elimination of some programs and jobs through attrition.\ One segment of the population may receive a tuition break. Lawmakers passed a bill that gives undocumented immigrants who graduate from a Utah high school residency status, qualifying them for cheaper tuition rates. Another bill made it harder for out-of- state students to qualify for resident tuition.\ On the bright side, new classroom buildings were approved on six campuses.\ -- Kirsten Stewart\ TUITION TAX CREDITS\ Supporters of tuition tax credits may have hurt their own cause by threatening lawmakers with the loss of campaign donations and re- election fights.\ The bill giving parents and businesses a $2,100 income tax credit for payment of private school tuition was withdrawn in the final hours of the 2002 Legislature after sponsor Sen. Chris Buttars, R- West Jordan, realized he lacked the votes to pass it.\ Senate President Al Mansell, R-Sandy, said the proposal had fewer votes on the session's last day than it had the week prior because of too much pressure applied to lawmakers.\ Supporters pitched the bill as a way to alleviate the crush of students on public education. But opponents said losing a few students wouldn't make a difference because of districts' fixed costs.\ Both sides launched a barrage of e-mails, phone calls and cornered lawmakers in person. Specifically targeted were about a dozen Republican representatives who had either decided to vote against the bill or hadn't made their minds up.\ Even senators who backed it received vehement phone calls from supporters frustrated the bill languished in the Senate before it was pulled.\ -- Marta Murvosh\ COUNTIES\ Salt Lake County and the Utah Association of Counties forged some victories during the session, but it is one large defeat that will stand out.\ Salt Lake County Mayor Nancy Workman, and to a lesser extent the County Council, funneled a lot of political capital into the passage of House Bill 324 -- which would have required that future annexations essentially be revenue-neutral. The bill also would have given the community councils the right to protest annexations. With such provisions, the county hoped to stabilize future budgets.\ But the county came away with nothing. HB324, sponsored by Rep. Lamont Tyler, R-East Millcreek, was watered down by removing a rule requiring annexation revenues not exceed costs by more than 5 percent. It still failed; so did a similar, 11th-hour bill by Senate Majority Leader Steven Poulton, R-Holladay.\ ""We're disappointed,"" County Councilman Michael Jensen said.\ The county and UAC did score a significant win with the passage of HB286, sponsored by Rep. Greg Curtis, R-Sandy, which requires the state to pay 75 percent of the costs for all state prisoners. Previously, the state only paid until prisoner funding ran out. The new statute will add up to $5 million to county coffers statewide the next three years, with Salt Lake County netting a little less than half of it.\ The Legislature also strengthened the ability of townships in Salt Lake County to stay intact with the approval of HB126, sponsored by Rep. Carl Duckworth, D-Magna, and it ratified a previous agreement between Salt Lake County and the cities with the passage of HB330. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Eric Hutchings, R-Kearns, shifts the cost of the sheriff's canyon patrol and fire and rescue from the municipal services fund to the countywide general fund.\ Lawmakers also passed four bills to deal with the vexing problem of subdivisions that cross county lines. The problem needed to be addressed with homes on Draper's Traverse Ridge that bisect Utah and Salt Lake counties.\ -- Joe Baird\ MORAL ISSUES\ As expected, Utah lawmakers worked themselves into a lather over moral fiber, religious foundation and family (read Utah) values this session -- and that was before they passed a single bill.\ Cloaking himself for a gubernatorial run, Republican House Speaker Marty Stephens opened the 2002 Legislature with a call to the faithful: ""Religion and strict moral beliefs are an inseparable part of our system of government. . . . The more we, in the name of political correctness, or accommodation, deny this nation's reliance on a divine being, the more we jeopardize the very foundation of our system of government.""\ Lawmakers responded in kind.\ With the addition of six words, legislators codified a belief that life begins at conception and that to end a life even a second after a human egg is fertilized is homicide. Senate Bill 178 -- which did not receive a dissenting vote -- protects an unborn child ""at any stage of its development."" SB178 exempts abortion but leaves unanswered potentially huge questions about how the bill affects scientific research with stem cells or artificial insemination.\ House Republicans demanded their colleagues pass a resolution urging the U.S. Congress to pass an amendment to protect the life of the unborn. Senators, wary of debating abortion in an election year, killed the unborn child resolution without taking a vote.\ Lawmakers did pass a bill requiring public schools to hang posters declaring trust in God.\ Democratic Rep. David Litvack of Salt Lake City, one of two practicing Jews in the Legislature, tried to convince House members that posting the country's first motto ""E Pluribus Unum"" (from many, one) would be less divisive. His motion failed.\ -- Greg Burton\ THIS CAN BE CUT:\ DIVORCE\ Although only a handful of proposed bills dealing with divorce, child custody, child support and visitation survived this year's legislative session, a lawmaker said he plans to reintroduce the rest next year.\ Sen. Terry Spencer, R-Layton and a family law attorney, sponsored four of at least nine bills dealing with such issues. Two of those, one amending Utah's visitation law to allow grandparents to intervene in custody proceedings and another limiting testimony of children in divorce cases, received legislative approval.\ The grandparent bill brings state law in line with a U.S. Supreme Court decision, Spencer said. His other bills, which would have addressed the division of a home in a divorce and limited alimony to the number of years the marriage lasted, failed. But he has vowed to bring them up ""until they pass.""\ Another bill receiving approval spells out a minimum visitation schedule when a noncustodial parent leaves the state or moves more than 150 miles away, provided the two parents cannot agree on a schedule. It also requires the Office of Recovery Services to verify information before acting on a possibly unfounded accusation of nonpayment of child support.\ Other bills weren't so lucky this year. Measures that would have changed child support laws, protected private information on divorce records and created a new Office of Parent Visitation in Salt Lake County fell by the wayside.\ -- Ashley E. Broughton\ END OPT CUT\ PUBLIC HEALTH\ The Legislature's work on public health and medical issues came up even-handed.\ Utahns, for instance, won a genetic privacy bill to protect them from unscrupulous employers and insurers who might use personal DNA codes to discriminate based on the likelihood of disease. But defeated was a gender parity plan, Senate Bill 54, designed to move women's health care closer to the level of care provided to insured men.\ Oral health proponents defeated an anti-fluoride push via the defeat of House Bills 158 and 309. Those measures could have stalled ongoing fluoridation plans in Salt Lake and Davis counties.\ The state Department of Health lost with two years' worth of budget cuts that should keep benefits from being restored to the now- suffering Medicaid office and CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program.\ The even-handedness of the public-health debate became pronounced during a pre-Olympics committee hearing on SB54, one of two proposed ""pill bills."" SB54 sought to clarify insurance rules on preauthorizations for prenatal and maternity care. It also mandated that companies that pay for certain male-only prescriptions, including Viagra, cover contraceptive devices.\ L awmakers and public speakers at the Senate Health and Environment Committee meeting agreed it's unfair that women currently pay some 68 percent more for health care than men. Finally, the panel rejected the pro-parity SB54 on a 2-2 vote after citing fears the pill mandate could feed rising health-care costs.\ -- Troy Goodman\ HIGHWAYS\ Lawmakers spent plenty of energy on highways and transit -- even though both entities did not suffer the state-mandated funding cuts of other programs.\ The legal impasse over the Legacy Highway segment through south Davis County drew the most attention as lawmakers approved a bill that allows the state to seek damages from opponents who sue to stop a federally approved state project.\ However, most lawmakers and Attorney General Mark Shurtleff do not believe the bill, if signed into law by Leavitt, can be used retroactively against Legacy opponents.\ A monumental transit bill calls for a constitutional amendment that will go before voters this November allowing public agencies, such as the Utah Transit Authority, to sell assets to private businesses and then lease them back to take advantage of a federal tax loophole.\ Such a deal would free up millions for UTA to expand bus and train service.\ Other highway construction-related pro- jects approved were:\ A $159 million bonding bill that, in part, would fully fund expansion of state Route 36 in Tooele County.\ The sale of $50 million in bonds that would speed up nine projects on a state highway priority list over the next 10 years. Accelerated projects include adding extra lanes on Interstate 15 from 10600 South in Sandy to the Utah County line, reconstruction of the aging Beck Street overpass on I-15 in North Salt Lake and an environmental- impact study for the Legacy Highway corridor.\ Aeconomic-stimulus package that boosts three projects: widening 12300 South in Draper from I-15 to Bangerter Highway; widening Redwood Road from 9000 South to Bangerter; adding lanes to state Route 201 (2100 South Freeway); and rebuilding three interchanges from 900 West to Bangerter.\ -- John Keahey\ CORRECTIONS\ The Utah Department of Corrections will be tightening its belt following budget cuts imposed by the 2002 Legislature, but the real squeeze won't be felt until next year, said Director Mike Chabries.\ T he impact of budget cuts will be softened by the fact that the department has nearly $2 million in ""lapsed funds"" from 2001 and recently received a federal grant to the tune of $651,000, he said.\ That -- along with a prison population that remained steady last year for the first time in two decades -- allowed Chabries to avoid furloughing Corrections employees, as he had earlier feared.\ ""We kept our population flat last year thanks in large part to the implementation of a new supervisory program,"" Chabries said. ""The new strategy focuses on community supervision . . . It's less cost to the taxpayer than keeping inmates incarcerated.""\ The department also will feel a pinch from new legislation that requires the Corrections Department to collect DNA from every inmate, parolee and probationer to add to a nationwide database.\ The procedure costs $75 per person and Chabries plans to collect the fee from convicts who can pay. But, he said, ""It'll cost us. Still, I think it's a very important program.""\ -- Kevin Cantera"
279,"There couldn't be another strike in modern America that compares with the standoff now occurring between United Parcel Service and the Teamsters.\There isn't another such large, unionized company that could be shut down with effects so widely felt. There's not another union that could draw such attention to its fight.\And the stakes for all of organized labor are as big as the adversaries.\This strike is a battle over the role of part-time workers in the American workplace and the role of unions in the evolving, service-industry-driven national economy.\For those reasons, the AFL-CIO's new president, John Sweeney, is strongly backing the Teamsters. Sweeney's purpose is nothing less than ``trying to use the UPS dispute as a vehicle for showing the benefits of unions,'' said Charles Craver, a professor of labor law at George Washington University.\An outcome seen as positive for the Teamsters could help spur labor's fledgling attempts at a resurgence. A perceived defeat could do real damage.\``The issues on the bargaining table go to the heart of the economic anxiety so many Americans feel,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor scholar at the University of California at Berkeley. ``We may well look back a decade from now and see the strike as a symbol of labor's resurgence.''\Or it may be seen as a sort of last stand by the labor movement, which has seen a steady decline in its share of the work force -- now down to about 10 percent in the private sector.\``The strike is only going to push the unions further downhill,'' said Leo Troy, a Rutgers University economist. Even a win for the Teamsters will be so marginal, he said, ``that workers involved will have to ask themselves at the end of the day, `Was it worth it?' ''\Talks continued Sunday, with the Teamsters union and the company saying there was movement at the bargaining table. But in a teleconference to brief local union activists on the status of the meetings, Teamsters President Ron Carey said that while many issues were under discussion, no agreements had been reached, according to Teamsters who heard the call.\UPS is just the kind of service-oriented employer that unions must focus on if they are to survive.\In the past, when unions have tried to organize in manufacturing companies, or demand a lot from them, those companies have sometimes responded by shutting down U.S. factories and opening new ones overseas. UPS, like many other service-oriented businesses, doesn't have that option. It can't go anywhere.\Beyond that, the part-time question is key. UPS has grown increasingly reliant upon part-timers -- albeit relatively well-paid ones who receive some benefits -- because the competitive environment dictates the flexibility that comes with using part-timers.\Carey, who began his career as a UPS driver in Queens, N.Y., has declared that American workers can't build a life on part-time work -- even though surveys show that most part-time workers in the United States are part-time by choice -- and that it's time to make a stand.\He has been joined by Sweeney, who has been championing a new, more militant union activism since his election two years ago.\``Because their fight is our fight, we are making this strike our strike,'' Sweeney said recently as he pledged $10 million a week in AFL-CIO loans to the Teamsters' strike fund. ``It's about part-time jobs and half-time pay. . . . And it's about a greedy, hugely profitable employer who wants to make even more money by shortchanging workers.''\Company officials -- who in their latest formal offer proposed a gradual shift of 11,000 part-time jobs into full-time positions -- say the strike has less to do with part-time jobs than with pension money.\In their view, the key issue is the union's resistance to the company's plan to create a new pension fund that would cover UPS employees alone -- and take billions of dollars out of the Teamsters' control.\The strike also is, in some ways, a throwback to years past. Generations ago strikes shut down businesses and picket lines held firm. Companies did not hire replacement workers.\That changed in 1981, when the nation's air-traffic controllers walked out -- and were fired by President Reagan.\With that strike, the etiquette of labor relations changed, with management realizing that replacement workers could be hired and that business, if not quite as usual, could go on. Strikes began to decline dramatically in both number and effect.\Thus far, at least, UPS seems to be playing by the old rules. While the company has said that as many as 15,000 jobs may have to be eliminated if the job action continues, it has not indicated -- at least so far -- that it will try to replace the 185,000 striking Teamsters.\UPS generally has enjoyed good relations with the Teamsters over the years, but in the past decade the company has seen increasing competition from rivals such as Federal Express Corp. and RPS Inc., which are non-union. Those competitors have managed to stave off the unions, keeping their labor costs lower.\Labor's failure to organize those new companies is making the Teamsters' fight against UPS all the more difficult because there is credence for UPS's arguments that it needs flexibility to compete against non-union companies.\But that has hardly dissuaded big labor. UPS's contract with the Teamsters has made for the biggest, most visible negotiations since Sweeney took over the AFL-CIO and attempted to re-assert labor's influence. His allies, while acknowledging the risks in the UPS strike, see it as the perfect opportunity for the labor movement to go for a big victory.\``It's the right time and the right industry for the AFL to draw a line in the sand,'' said Michael Holland, a Chicago labor lawyer and former general counsel to the United Mineworkers Union. ``It's as good a chance as we'll see.''"
