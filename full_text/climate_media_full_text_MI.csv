The economic meltdown, energy crisis and global warming are interconnected, and so are the solutions. By implementing the right policies, we can create jobs, secure our energy independence and power capacity, and protect natural resources for our future.
\
But we need a long-term strategy that provides better energy choices by driving investments to build, deliver and install clean energy solutions. We need energy policies that will support both a U.S. auto industry and other manufacturing and that are vibrant, competitive, technologically advanced and an integral part of the solution to global warming.
\
The cap-and-trade legislation will help take a balanced approach toward an economy-wide program that prevents foreign competitors from getting advantages over America companies. The nation should maintain a diverse energy portfolio that includes renewable energy, fossil fuels, nuclear and hydro electric. And solutions must protect individual industries and geographical regions from being disproportionably or adversely affected.
\
Such a strategy is the American Clean Energy &amp; Security Act, which is in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which will help to create millions of new clean-energy jobs, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, encourage the development of cleaner, cheaper sources of energy, and dramatically cut the carbon pollution that causes global warming.
\
The historic changes in the legislation -- also known as the Waxman-Markey bill -- come with risks, and we must work to balance bettering the environment with job creation.
\
The Michigan congressional delegation has been working hard to protect and promote the auto industry, including garnering $50 billion in low-interest loans for automakers to retool their production facilities. U.S. Rep. John Dingell, D-Dearborn, deserves credit for leading the fight to secure 3 percent of the revenue from the auctioning of carbon emission permits, worth an estimated $10 billion to $20 billion over the next 20 years, for the auto industry to develop advanced technology vehicles.
\
Two labor-environmental groups, the Blue Green Alliance and Apollo Alliance, support this legislation.
\
We have seen other examples of trade unions working to both protect jobs and better our environment. Recently, union leaders stood with President Barack Obama when he announced new fuel-economy and tailpipe emission standards. This was truly an historic achievement, bringing together labor, industry, environmentalists and government in support of a comprehensive and consistent national policy.
\
While the resulting standards are aggressive, calling for a 30 percent improvement in fuel efficiency by 2016, they are achievable within the time lines proposed. And they can help to spur a renaissance in the American auto industry, creating new jobs as manufacturers restructure to build the clean energy vehicles of the future.
\
Creating a clean energy economy will be good for Michigan with the potential of thousands of new, well-paying jobs. According to the Michigan Department of Energy, Labor and Economic Development's ""green jobs"" report, from 2005 to 2008, more than 2,500 green jobs were added to Michigan's economy, a growth rate of 7.7 percent.
\
Green jobs also pay well; 13 of the top 15 sectors of green employment have weekly wages above the overall private sector weekly average. The Steel Workers union reminds us that each wind turbine built contain 250 tons of steel and thousands of machined parts.
\
We have an opportunity to rebuild our economy with millions of clean energy jobs, retool manufacturing, increase our energy independence and preserve the planet for future generations. It is time for the leaders in Washington to take the bold, forward-looking action that we need by passing the Waxman-Markey bill.

1,"Who is responsible for maintaining and improving our environment? The answer, of course, is: We are. That's why the April 19 editorial, ""Cap-and-trade system is really a tax,"" by Hillsdale College Economics and Public Policy Professor Gary Wolfram, Ph.D., was surprising and difficult to understand.\Dr. Wolfram argues that the cap-and-trade system should be shelved because we are unable to measure the environmental cost per ton of carbon dioxide emission in comparison to the benefits we receive from fossil fuel-produced goods. This is like firemen not fighting fires because we haven't measured the property values of the structures in comparison to firefighting costs. In fighting fires, we use our taxes to pay the costs and take action. We accept our responsibility.\Alarms have sounded in recent years because atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and global temperatures are at record highs. Natural phenomenon, some beyond our control, can be the cause. The strong consensus among scientists, however, is that high CO2 levels, produced by human activity and over which we do have some control, are the cause of today's warming. We must reduce emissions. This is our responsibility. Consequences of inaction will be far greater than cap-and-trade system costs.\Glaciers worldwide are receding. Concern has been expressed that receding Himalayan glaciers will someday halt the water supply to major rivers in India and China. Economic and human impact would be devastating. The cost of a cap-and-trade system today, taking action now, assuming our responsibility to ourselves and to our planet, would not compare to the costs of such a disaster.\Increased ocean water acidity is another recent observation. Some absorbed CO2 is converted to carbonic acid. Shells collected today are significantly thinner than those measured in museum collections. Acidity, along with increased ocean water temperature, is the cause of observed coral bleaching. Some divers claim that action is unneeded because many reefs have never looked better. This is like the firemen saying not to worry about the fire in the kitchen since the living room looks great.\Dr. Wolfram points out that oil and natural gas companies and electric utilities will feel the greatest impact of a cap-and-trade system. Isn't this just as it should be? Action is going to require money. These companies, recording huge profits, are exactly where responsibility belongs. Incentives for alternative technologies and developments that reduce both emissions and costs are created. New jobs and employment opportunity will follow in the process. Cap-and-trade will stimulate economic growth.\Dr. Wolfram also points out that action to reduce emissions need not be taken because our improvements will be overwhelmed by emissions from China. This is like saying that we don't need to fight forest fires in Colorado because fires are going to be worse in Idaho. Also, we abdicate our leadership role, lose research and development opportunity and, through inaction, discard our voice for an improved environment.\Dr. Wolfram's editorial, ""Cap-and-trade system is really a tax,"" makes no reference to environmental responsibility. This is surprising and difficult to understand. Cap-and-trade is really an investment.\Robert Learner of Battle Creek is retired director of Kingman Museum of Natural History."
2,"WASHINGTON - Both of Michigan's senators voted against a measure that would have protected a sweeping climate-change bill from being filibustered.\Although the climate-change bill isn't even out of the hands of Henry Waxman, the California Democrat who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee and wrote the bill - the Senate passed an amendment to the budget resolution Wednesday night prohibiting it from falling under the process of reconciliation. If that process had been used, it would have meant a 60-vote supermajority wouldn't be needed to cut off debate.\That 60-vote margin is what is needed to end a filibuster - the legislative tool allowed in the Senate to continue discussions in the hope of killing or significantly altering a bill.\The vote against reconciliation was 67-31, including 26 Democrats.\Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan were among them. Levin was one of more than two dozen Republican and Democratic senators who signed a letter saying the climate-change bill and its biggest component - a cap-and-trade system of auctioning off pollution emission permits for industry - was too important and far-reaching, especially in the industrial Midwest, not to undergo substantial debate.\Another possibility worth mentioning: While media attention on the climate-change legislation has largely focused on cap-and-trade, the draft legislation also includes a provision saying future fuel-economy standards would have to match California's limits on cars and trucks and would preserve that state's power to set its own vehicle emission rules.\Detroit's automakers have been fighting the California rules and say they want a single national standard.\Stabenow spokesman Brad Carroll said Thursday that the senator ""continues to work to ensure that climate change legislation is done in a way that will create jobs"" and didn't think reconciliation was the way to go.\California's two senators - Democrats Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein - voted for reconciliation.\ILLUSTRATION: Photo\CAPTION: U.S. Sens.

Cap-and-trade tax plan would damage Michigan

Cap-and-trade tax plan would damage Michigan
\
By Gary Wolfram
\
The proposed $650 billion ""cap and trade"" tax being pushed by the Obama administration will reduce economic growth in the United States, damage Michigan manufacturing, raise consumer costs sharply, increase our reliance on unstable sources of oil and harm free trade, all in the false hope of improving the environment.
\
The purpose of curbing carbon dioxide emissions is supposedly to prevent environmental damage from producing or using fossil fuels, which account for 85 percent of the energy used in the United States.
\
But to make any economic sense, the cap-and-trade tax in the proposed American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 would require that Congress compare the environmental cost per ton of carbon dioxide emissions to the benefit consumers get from the goods and services that are made possible from the use of oil, natural gas and coal. Then Congress would design a system where the benefit from reduced emissions was at least equal to the economic cost of reduced production.
\
No one in Congress has any idea what the cost to the environment of another ton of carbon dioxide is nor has a good idea of the lost value of production from requiring major emitters to purchase allowances. What is clear is that the allowances are being set to generate an enormous amount of tax revenue regardless of what the benefits are to the environment or the costs to the economy.
\
First, the primary argument that carbon dioxide emissions are a cost to the environment is that they contribute to global warming. That is debatable. S. Fred Singer, former director of the U.S. National Weather Satellite Service, argues persuasively in ""Unstoppable Global Warming"" that global warming is a naturally occurring phenomenon.
\
Second, it may be more cost effective to find a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than to prevent it from getting into the atmosphere in the first place. Richard Branson has offered a $25-million prize to anyone who finds a commercially viable method of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Third, the effect on the environment of reductions in U.S. emissions is likely to be overwhelmed by emissions from China, the largest and fastest growing emitter of greenhouse gases, and other emerging economies.
\
The requirement that electric utilities, oil companies and large manufacturers buy allowances to emit carbon dioxide would increase the cost of producing manufactured goods since they will have to invest in a more expensive production process or purchase carbon allowances. The increased costs will result in lower production, fewer jobs and higher prices.
\
Because Michigan relies on coal-fueled power plants for 65 percent of its electricity, our state will be particularly hard hit. Manufacturing is likely to move overseas to countries that are not beset by higher environmental costs. U.S. manufacturers will face added uncertainties since the cost of emission allowances will almost surely fluctuate. As the cost of allowances rise and fall, there will be less incentive to expand or add new manufacturing facilities.
\
The effect of the carbon tax and the administration's proposal for an additional $81 billion in taxes on the electric utilities and oil and natural gas companies would be increased reliance on energy supplies from regions of the world that are unstable or unfriendly. With increasing unemployment, financial instability and uncertain political conditions in the Middle East, this is no time to boost taxes on energy production.
\
The notion of a cap-and-trade tax on carbon dioxide emissions should be shelved until sound science has provided a reasonable estimate of the net cost of manmade emissions.

4,"The inconvenient truth about the proposed ""cap and trade"" system for reducing carbon dioxide emissions is this: It's really a tax. If adopted, the plan being pushed by the Obama administration and congressional Democratic leaders will reduce economic growth in the United States, damage Michigan manufacturing, raise consumer costs sharply, increase our reliance on unstable sources of oil and harm free trade, all in the false hope of improving the environment.\The purpose of curbing carbon dioxide emissions is supposedly to prevent environmental damage from producing or using fossil fuels, which account for 85 percent of the energy used in the United States.

What is clear is that the allowances are being set to generate an enormous amount of tax revenue regardless of what the benefits to the environment are or the costs to the economy due to lost production.\The proposed legislation would require the nation's economy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, leading to an 83 percent reduction by 2050. There is not a chance that these targets were set by determining the cost to the environment from carbon dioxide emissions.\First, the primary argument that carbon dioxide emissions are a cost to the environment is that they contribute to global warming. There is not even a scientific consensus that global warming is being caused by man-made carbon emissions. S. Fred Singer, former director of the U.S. National Weather Satellite Service, argues persuasively in his book, ""Unstoppable Global Warming,"" that global warming is a natural occurring phenomenon.\Second, it may be more cost-effective to find a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than to prevent it from getting into the atmosphere in the first place. Richard Branson has offered a $25-million prize to anyone who finds a commercially viable method of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Third, the effect on the environment of reductions in U.S. emissions is likely to be overwhelmed by emissions from China, now the largest and fastest growing emitter of greenhouse gases, and other emerging economies.\The cap-and-trade tax is purely a maneuver to increase taxes and allow administration officials and influential members of Congress to impose their will on the country. Last June the Heritage Foundation warned that a cap-and-trade tax would amount to an unprecedented government interference in the economy. Unfortunately, since then, the federal government has become engaged in running the auto industry and the financial services industry. And now we are about to invite some powerful congressional committee chairmen like California Rep. Henry Waxman to mold U.S. energy production to their own vision of the future.\The requirement that electric utilities, oil companies and large manufacturers buy allowances in order to emit carbon dioxide will increase the cost of producing manufactured goods since they will have to invest in a more expensive production process or purchase carbon allowances. The increased costs will result in lower production, fewer jobs and higher prices.\Because Michigan relies on coal-fueled power plants for 65 percent of its electricity, our state will be particularly hard hit. Manufacturing is likely to move overseas to countries that are not beset by higher environmental costs. U.S. manufacturers will face added uncertainties since the cost of emission allowances will almost surely fluctuate. As the cost of allowances rise and fall, there will be less incentive to expand or add new manufacturing facilities.\Two major industries in particular - electric utilities and oil and natural gas companies - are likely to be badly harmed by the combination of carbon fees and the administration's tax policy. It's estimated that companies would have to pay $650 billion for carbon allowances. And the administration's budget proposal includes an additional $81 billion in taxes on the oil and natural gas industry. The result is companies will have less money available to invest in domestic energy production, especially oil and gas exploration. This will increase the nation's reliance on energy supplies from regions of the world that are unstable or unfriendly. Now, with increasing unemployment, financial instability, and uncertain political conditions in the Middle East, this is no time to boost taxes on energy production. The notion of clamping a cap-and-trade tax on carbon dioxide emissions should be shelved until sound science has provided a reasonable estimate of the net cost of man-made emissions.\Gary Wolfram, Ph.D., is William Simon Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Hillsdale College."
5,"The U.S. House recently passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, also known as cap and trade, to limit carbon emissions. Electric utilities, oil refiners and natural gas producers will all be taxed. All costs will be passed on to consumers. According to those who have studied the bill, the cap-and-trade tax will be expensive and kill millions of jobs.\This is the most convoluted attempt at economic and environmental central planning this nation has ever attempted. Cap and trade works by raising the cost of energy high enough so individuals and businesses are forced to use less of it.\This bill inflicts economic pain and will make all families poorer. As the increasing emissions standards are met, families will be forced to spend more on energy.\Terry W. Mulawa\Roseville\Small steps important\Though the July 3 article ""House climate bill wouldn't cut U.S. oil dependence much"" argued that the House passage of the American Clean Energy and Security Act takes only a modest step, the fact that this bill passed by only a few votes points to the necessity of praising even small steps in the contentious battle for our environment and future economic livelihood.\We should praise the representatives who voted yes and urge Sen. Debbie Stabenow and others to take the same stand. Strengthening the bill to further reduce oil and fossil fuel dependency in favor of renewable and cost-effective energy sources should be the next top priority.\Annette Arendt\Ann Arbor\Economic threat\As an engineer, I will advise you that this is the worst piece of legislation I ever heard discussed, as it does not solve either the clean air or energy problems. All it does is create a monstrous government organization costing trillions and eliminate many American jobs.\I want clean air and an energy policy that will make America independent from all foreign sources, but this Democratic-developed bill won't do it.\Richard Morrissett\President, International Institute\for Strategic Studies, Davison\Higher household costs\Your July 12 editorial ""Better to invest now in slowing global warming than risk calamity"" had the risks and rewards related to the cap-and-trade legislation passed by the U.S. House reversed. This bill would be an economic disaster for the United States and Michigan.\According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, this misguided, Democrat-sponsored legislation would cost each American household an average of $1,600 a year. In a worst-case scenario, the CBO estimates the extra cost would be $2,200 per household.\Randy Kniebes\Brighton\Expand bottle bill\With environmental issues on the rise, Michigan needs to take action. The state Senate is considering a bottle bill expansion that would add water bottles, juice, ice tea and power drinks to our state's deposit law. Getting this bill passed would mean less waste in our landfills and a bigger recycling program for our state.\Alana Hart\Rochester Hills\Power in sight\I thank Free Press travel writer Ellen Creager for her honest, if flippant, column bemoaning the ""ugliness"" of wind power (""Blowing hot and cold on wind turbines,"" June 7). She makes clear that since electricity is not magical and sourceless after all, darn it, its generation should remain hidden.\We've naively wanted cheap electricity with little or no regard to its production and effect on other environments and human lives. And we've wanted to believe that since we didn't see the plants or the mines, that our electricity was essentially invisible to produce -- and harmless.\Rebecca Hammond\Ferndale"
6,"The recent removal of the bald eagle from the Endangered Species List after its widespread recovery from near extinction was not just a victory for conservationists, but a victory for the American people. It demonstrated what's possible when we actively work to protect the natural world for our children.\And it reminded us of the foresight that gave birth to America's landmark conservation laws: the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and others.\Michigan's elder statesman, John Dingell, was pivotal in the drafting and passage of those laws. He recently showed that same visionary spirit by announcing plans to confront the greatest environmental challenge facing us: global warming.\Rep. Dingell, D-Dearborn, chairman of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee, has committed himself to passing legislation that will cut global warming emissions by 60% to 80% by mid-century. This amounts to about 2% a year, the rate scientists say is needed to avoid the worst impacts of global warming.\The key to making this work, environmentally and economically, is to start reducing global warming emissions promptly. For that, we need to reverse emissions trends. American emissions of the gases that cause global warming have increased 14% in the 1990s, as our dependence on fossil fuels such as oil and coal has increased. Fortunately, emissions actually went down last year, and have grown only by roughly 1% since 2001.\We need a national program that freezes emissions before they start growing again and then cuts them by 2% every year. Waiting until later would be a costly mistake, economically and environmentally. If we allow emissions to grow unchecked in the near term, businesses will be forced to achieve far steeper and more costly reductions in the future. The country will also risk spending far more in attempts to protect the public from climate-related harms, risk greater threats of wildlife extinction and risk more extreme weather.\Dingell, of course, has faced criticism on the issue of automotive fuel economy standards, which are linked to curbing global warming. The key to moving past the political controversy is recognizing that those who pit the economy against the environment are presenting a false choice. Properly structured mileage standards, like building and appliance standards and renewable energy standards, can create jobs and stimulate the economy by sparking innovation and reinvestment in our manufacturing base. And they do these things best if they are part of an economy-wide policy to reduce global warming.\A staunch defender of economically embattled auto communities, Dingell is looking to forge a durable legislative compromise that will be both environmentally and economically responsible. He is trying to put this Congress on track to develop the nation's next landmark conservation law.\Here's what that law should look like. America can best achieve rapid, cost-effective reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by implementing an economy-wide ""cap-and-trade"" system. The plan would set an overall national limit on carbon emissions by major emitters (the cap) while allowing each to pick the most efficient way to reduce pollution. Emitters could buy and sell emissions permits, rewarding companies that innovate, and offering flexibility to everyone. It is no wonder that Ford and Chrysler recently joined General Motors in calling for a strong, mandatory national carbon reduction plan that includes cap-and-trade.\Another benefit of the cap-and-trade system would be the steady stream of revenue it could raise to help American industry, communities and working families rapidly transition to new technologies. It could also be used to help offset global warming's impacts on the natural world.\Global warming is a profound threat to nature, the economy, and our personal well-being. But it is also a tremendous opportunity. We can spur economic growth immediately by beginning the transition to a highly efficient, low carbon economy.\As he did years ago with the passage of America's bedrock conservation laws, Dingell is setting a course in the coming months for the well-being of generations to come. Leading the fight for a cap-and-trade bill to cut carbon emissions could be remembered for decades as his most important conservation legacy.\ANDY BUCHSBAUM is director of the National Wildlife Federation's Great Lakes Natural Resource Center in Ann Arbor.

If it accomplishes nothing else, the National Summit under way in the Renaissance Center will serve its mission if it wakes up Americans to the vital need for a sound national industrial policy.
\
In opening the summit Monday, Ford Motor Co. Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. noted ""there are still some in this country who don't care about our manufacturing base."" He is being kind.
\
He could have just as easily said there are too many who are openly hostile to manufacturing and consider it an environmental evil.
\
Both Ford and his summit co-chair, Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical Co., called for an industrial policy that works in tandem with the environmental and energy policy.
\
Currently, environmental protection and industrial growth are competing agendas, with the environmentalists most often prevailing. Efforts to curtail greenhouse gases focus on policies such as carbon cap-and-trade that place severe limits on manufacturing and energy production.
\
Liveris said a ""sane energy policy has for too long been an oxymoron"" and echoed Ford's call for energy and environmental measures that both curb pollution and allow the country to get back to ""making real things -- real innovative things.""
\
America has little hope for a broad economic revival unless it shores up and expands its crumbling manufacturing base. As a percentage of gross domestic product, manufacturing has declined 25 percent in the past decade.
\
""We can't devastate a central component of the economy,"" said panelist Deborah Wince-Smith of the Council on Competitiveness. She added that the environment is no better off if America drives its manufacturing overseas and then buys back the imported products.
\
The summit is off to a good start in addressing the central challenge of shaping a new economy.
\
We can't continue to compartmentalize environmental and industrial policy. The two must be integrated with the goal of creating a vigorous economy in a clean environment.

Throughout history, climate change has adversely impacted low-income communities, which have become particularly vulnerable to flooding, high carbon emissions and co-pollutants. These events have led to displacement and high levels of cancer, asthma and other respiratory illnesses.
\
Detroiters Working for Environmental Justice (DWEJ) was established in 1994 to respond to the disproportional burdens facing people of color and low-income residents in environmentally distressed communities.
\
At a time when urban centers are depressed with job loss, aging infrastructure and numerous abandoned properties, DWEJ is on the cutting edge of finding unique solutions that integrate environmental justice, city revitalization and economic development.
\
Over the past several months, DWEJ and other environmental justice advocates have worked closely on the federal climate legislation - H.R. 2454 (American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009) and S.1733 (Clean Energy Jobs and America Power Act) to ensure that stringent measures are adopted to closely monitor and regulate cap and trade, significantly increase green job opportunities for historically under-represented communities, and substantially curtail carbon emissions in low-income communities.
\
The passage of a climate justice energy bill is critically important because it will strengthen the United States position of negotiation in future Conference of Parties (COP) climate negotiations.
\
We must have a strong focus on substantially reducing green house gasses, carbon dioxide, providing financial support for adaptation and technology transfer for developing countries and small island states.
\
Thousands of people descended upon Copenhagen, Denmark, Dec. 7-18, ranging from world presidents to foreign ministers, to party leaders to non-government organizations (NGO's) to business groups, in anticipation of a climate agreement being reached. This Climate Conference (COP15) was considered the largest ever, drawing over 40,000 people. Indeed, it was considered a who's who of who's who premier functions.
\
There were 192 nations and over 110 heads of state in attendance. What a perfect and unique opportunity to develop a binding agreement that would immediately develop and enforce short- and long-term goals for reducing green house gasses. All of the necessary players were represented. The stage was set.
\
As DWEJ has played an active role in proposing amendments to the federal energy legislation, we were very excited to join with other environmental justice advocates to participate in the Climate Conference for the duration.
\
This experience enabled us to meet with key stakeholders to express our concerns and share our recommendations about reducing global warming and addressing its adverse impact on vulnerable communities, nationally and internationally.
\
DWEJ met with several world government leaders, particularly African countries, to build a consensus on establishing a meaningful treaty during the conference.
\
We were particularly focused on ensuring that the global temperature should be closer to 1.5 Celsius, which will ease the devastation of global warming and agricultural development in particular. We are also concerned that developed countries, particularly the United States and China, have not made more aggressive commitments to reducing carbon emissions in the short term.
\
Reportedly, the United States and China are the two top carbon emitters. Recently, China surpassed the U.S. Together, they account for over 40 percent of carbon emissions. We shared these concerns with the White House, as well as the EPA, during the Copenhagen Conference.
\
In order to create a meaningful binding international treaty that is advantageous for developed countries, developing countries and small island states, there must be a more concerted effort from the United States, China, Brazil and India to appoint advisors with a vested interest in promoting environmental justice.
\
This is fundamentally important if we are going to reduce the adverse effects of climate change on national and international vulnerable communities.
\
Additionally, it is our fervent desire that developed countries will engage in more strategic conversations with non-government organizations (NGO's) and other stakeholders who endeavor to achieve a strong semblance of environmental justice.
\
DWEJ believes that the time is now for a climate justice agreement and we readily embrace the Climate Change Treaty, which was developed prior to the Climate Conference to respond to the disastrous weather events experienced by Gulf Coast residents. It is imperative that the Copenhagen Accord (official agreement) fully incorporate these principles to protect our human right to a healthy and safe environment.
\
Highlights of the Climate Change Treaty (Developed by the Advocates for Environmental Human Rights, New Orleans, Louisiana):
\
* Reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide to below 350 parts per million
\
* Transition to a clean energy economy that supports alternatives for workers employed in carbon-intensive industries and communities that rely on such industries
\
* Prioritize improving the environmental health, educational, and economic conditions in communities that suffer from the impacts of carbon-intensive industries
\
* Ensure that vulnerable communities, and women from vulnerable communities, are included in all levels of decision-making on climate change policies
\
* Support the climate resiliency of indigenous and poor communities in the U.S. and around the world by fostering sustainable land use and building materials
\
* Ensure that climate change adaptation policies are aligned with the U.N. Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement
\
* Require best practices in coastal restoration, reforestation flood protection, and disaster mitigation in the U.S. and around the world.

\
On Thursday and Friday, Dec. 17-18, many of the world leaders arrived in Copenhagen. On Friday, after stalled talks, President Obama met with China, India, Brazil and South Africa, and created the Copenhagen Accord. Although this document did not assign a deadline for establishing a binding agreement or short-term commitments to reducing carbon emissions, it was a long-awaited step towards an agreement. However, many countries reluctantly accepted the Accord and viewed the conference as a failure.
\
Highlights of the Accord:
\
* Confirms the continuation of the Kyoto protocol and UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
\
* Sets maximum of 2 degrees Celsius for global temperature rise. Will review in 2016 to determine whether it should lower temperature to 1.5 Celsius (request of Africa, developing countries, small island states)
\
* Developed countries will commit $30 billion additional funding for developing countries for 2010-2012, and developed countries will support a goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries
\
* Developed countries commit at least 80 percent emission reduction by year 2050
\
* Mitigation actions subject to international measurement reporting and verification, will be monitored nationally and reported every second year by guidelines accepted by the parties to UNFCC
\
As the Conference of Parties (COP) moves towards establishing a binding treaty, we need for everyone to urge the U.S. Senate to pass an energy bill that is not watered down by the petroleum and coal industry, but achieves climate justice.
\
We need a fair energy bill that will protect low-income communities from the adverse effects of climate change, closely monitor and regulate the emissions reporting system, which is currently based on an honor system, and regulate the cap and trade system which has not been necessarily proven to reduce carbon emissions.
\
In fact, it is likely that older, dirtier facilities will feel compelled to buy more carbon permits than to reduce emissions because of the cost benefit. Call your senators today. U.S. Sen. Carl Levin can be reached at (313) 226-6020 or U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow can be reached at (313) 961-4330.
\
The next Conference of Parties 16 (COP16), held this year, will take place in Mexico City. COP 17 will take place in South Africa in 2011.

What if Detroit were the international center for advanced vehicle technology? What if the world followed our lead in the effort to reduce emissions? What if the military and the nation depended on us for vital national security assistance?
\
It happened before. And it can happen again.
\
All three domestic automakers now clearly get that global warming and oil dependency are serious problems for the nation and Detroit. Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Alan Mulally recently said Detroit can no longer afford to ignore these issues. General Motors, in a surprise announcement, joined the United States Climate Action Partnership, calling for 60-80 percent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
\
And Chrysler plans to invest more than $3 billion in the next few years to make its vehicles more fuel-efficient.
\
Big Three 'get it'
\
Cynical observers may think Detroit executives promote an economy-wide cap on greenhouse gas emissions to shield themselves. I choose to believe they are genuine.
\
Besides, it is hard to imagine an economy-wide cap that wouldn't necessitate significant improvements in automotive fuel economy or tailpipe emissions. Vehicles are going to have to change and fast.
\
Washington isn't wasting time. President Bush has signed an executive order directing his agencies to prepare regulations to raise fuel economy. And the bipartisan consensus emerging in Congress seems willing to demand that automakers improve fuel economy by 4 percent per year well into the future -- as the president proposed in his State of the Union address.
\
Detroit executives' reactions to what is happening in Washington have not been positive, but, significantly, none have said it is impossible. The Big Three automakers estimate that to make the fuel economy improvements outlined by Bush would cost them $114 billion or more over 10 years.
\
The exact dollar amount and reasons why it is unaffordable may be disputed, but the Big Three don't have that kind of cash.
\
The time for finger-pointing is past. The time for action is now. Our oil dependency, and the global warming it creates, is, as one military expert said, ""a clear and present danger -- economically, militarily, diplomatically and environmentally.""
\
Tap autos, oil, government
\
Recently, General Motors Vice Chairman Bob Lutz proposed an initiative on the scale of World War II's Manhattan Project to achieve the technological advances we need to reduce our nation's addiction to oil. Let's call this new initiative the Detroit Project and get funding from automakers, oil companies and the government.
\
An initiative on the scale of the Manhattan Project would take $30 billion in today's dollars -- far less than the $114 billion the automakers say increasing federal fuel economy mandates would cost them. Split the five-year investment three ways: $10 billion from the government and $10 billion each from automakers and oil companies.
\
Since 2001, federal spending on developing cleaner, cheaper and more reliable sources of energy has totaled $12 billion. The Detroit Project would require the same spending rate ($2 billion per year), but its focus would be on fuels and vehicles.
\
It is time for industry and government to put their money where their mouths are.
\
What the Detroit Project should develop are breakthrough technologies that achieve a specific and substantial reduction in oil used for transportation. The president proposed 20 percent reduction in oil consumption and Congress appears headed for a larger reduction. These should be the project's minimum targets.
\
The key to the Manhattan Project's success was the synergy it created by bringing together in one location the best and brightest of industry, government and academia. The Detroit Project needs to cast the same broad net.
\
Rather than dividing the interests of automakers and oil companies (as some cap-and-trade proponents seem to favor), the Detroit Project should focus on vehicles and fuels as integrated systems and should be technology neutral.
\
It is time for all of us to rise above old arguments and entrenched positions and get serious about real solutions for autos and oil dependency. It's time for the Detroit Project.

Frank Lautner, an avid bird watcher from Clinton Township, is troubled by the dwindling number of birds he finds on his frequent bird-watching outings.
\
Lautner, who says he's likely to vote in Michigan's presidential primary, will be thinking about those birds when he decides for whom he'll vote Jan. 15.
\
""I can see the same kinds of birds, but the numbers are down quite a bit,"" Lautner said. ""The positions of candidates on environmental issues really matter to me.""
\
In addition to ailing wetlands, Lautner worries about other threats to the Great Lakes, such as global warming, which some scientists warn could lower lake levels, as well as invasive species and sewage pipe overflows.
\
While polls in Michigan and nationally show that voters rank the environment far below Iraq, the economy and health care as their top concerns, the Iraq war, sky-high gas prices and devastating weather like Hurricane Katrina and wildfires out West have prompted voters -- and the presidential candidates -- to think of environmental issues more broadly, as an integral part of the GOP standbys of national security and job creation.
\
At the recent debate in Iowa, for example, Mitt Romney said that reducing greenhouse gases can be done in ways ""that help both the environment and the economy and national security.""
\
Issues are intertwined
\
Great Lakes regional director Andy Buchsbaum of the National Wildlife Federation points to such comments by the candidates in explaining what he and others see as a growing interest in environmental issues by Republicans.
\
""The Great Lakes, climate change, solar and wind power, these have become economic and security issues,"" Buchsbaum says.
\
""If a candidate wants to be competitive here in Michigan, he or she has to address global warming and cleaning up the Great Lakes because voters here now see those issues as tied to tourism dollars, new high-paying 'green' jobs, and national security.""
\
The candidates differ on how serious global warming is, how clear it is that human activity causes it, and whether the feds should step in to curb emissions.
\
The News will probe the candidates' positions on auto emissions in an upcoming report.
\
Only Sen. John McCain and Mike Huckabee have called for government action to reduce carbon emissions, the League of Conservation Voters notes. In its presidential voters guide, the League says that other than McCain ""None of the other Republican candidates... have offered any kind of comprehensive plan to address global warming.""
\
The League says McCain stands out in the Republican field on global warming, noting he is ""the only candidate to make global warming a part of his campaign agenda and to regularly address it on the campaign trail.""
\
In 2003, McCain introduced the first bill in the Senate to try to reduce global warming and advocates cutting carbon emissions 65 percent by 2050.
\
The nonpartisan group also praises Mike Huckabee for promising that the first thing he'd do as president is deliver a plan to Congress on how to make the U.S. energy independent.
\
On global warming, he advocates a cap-and-trade system in which businesses buy and sell credits to meet federal standards on greenhouse emissions.
\
Encouraging alternative fuels
\
Like McCain and Huckabee, the other Republican presidential candidates have talked about the need to wean the United States from politically unstable countries' foreign oil -- and the bonus of U.S. businesses becoming the world's leader on alternative fuel technology.
\
Texas congressman Ron Paul, for example, sponsors legislation to encourage development of solar and wind energy power.
\
But the Republicans are less of a single mind over whether Yucca Mountain is the best site for a national repository to store spent fuel that is piling up in temporary storage in Michigan and elsewhere. Nor do they agree on promising to sign the proposed $20 billion plan to restore the Great Lakes.
\
That bill is currently in Congress, and none of the four Republican presidential hopefuls serving in Congress -- Sen. McCain, and Reps. Tom Tancredo of Colorado, Duncan Hunter of California and Ron Paul -- is a co-sponsor.
\
U.S. Rep. Vern Ehlers, R-Grand Rapids, is part of a bipartisan push to get Democratic and Republican presidential candidates to sign a pledge to appoint a Cabinet-level aide to get the Great Lakes bill enacted.
\
No Republican has signed the pledge, although Sen. John McCain's campaign says he would sign the restoration legislation as president -- if he can swing it with other budget demands.
\
In response to questions from The News, Romney's campaign stopped short of saying he'd sign the Great Lakes restoration bill, but said the former Massachusetts governor considers cleanup ""important for economic development and job creation in the region.""
\
The Great Lakes restoration plan includes money to build a permanent barrier to prevent the voracious Asian carp from entering Lake Michigan, and to require oceangoing ships to filter invasive species from ballast water.
\
The invasive species issue isn't just of importance to wildlife, points out DTE Energy spokesman John Austerberry.
\
He notes it costs up to $400,000 a year to clean out one invasive species -- the zebra mussel -- from intake pipes of power plants along many of Michigan's rivers and all of the Great Lakes.
\
""At this stage, getting rid of (zebra mussels) has become like routine maintenance issue... (and it gets) passed on to the customers,"" he said.
\
Meanwhile, Michigan awaits the next president to end the fight over a permanent storage site for radioactive leftovers.
\
Michigan has four commercial reactors producing waste, and its closed Big Rock Point Nuclear Plant near Charlevoix has eight 20-foot-tall casks of radioactive materials waiting for a home.
\
While the Republican field favors expanding the nation's reliance on nuclear power, the candidates are split over whether Yucca Mountain, in Nevada should be the nation's radioactive waste dump.
\
McCain, Tancredo and former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson support the site. Giuliani and Romney offer mixed messages, saying they are open to it but have concerns. Paul opposes it completely, citing a state's right not to be forced to take another state's wastes.
\
And the next president could jumpstart the anemic Superfund and other federal toxic-waste cleanup programs to provide Michigan with more money to decontaminate the 65 highly polluted sites on the national Superfund priority list and clean up petroleum that leaked from 9,000 underground gasoline tanks.
\
""The federal fund designed to provide money to clean up leaking underground storage tanks contains more than $2.5 billion, which is not being tapped. Michigan desperately needs more money to deal with tank leaks,"" said Andrew Hogarth, chief of the remediation and redevelopment division of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.
\
In requests from The News, only McCain's team replied that the candidate wants the federal government to have a vigorous role in helping states deal with the legacy of industrial hazardous pollution.
\
Despite coming from a water-thirsty state, McCain is also the only Republican who said he'd sign the proposal to ban water diversion from the Great Lakes.
\
Charter boat captain Bill Duckwall of Marquette, an undecided Republican voter, said he's more likely to support a candidate in the Republican primary who says he'd ban water diversions.
\
""Hey, those hot states don't give me their sunshine, so why should they get our water?"" asks Duckwall. ""With the global warming problem, we certainly don't want to give our water away.""
\
Green issues in Michigan
\
¥ A new invasive species enters the Great Lakes every 28 weeks. Damage from invasive species throughout the Great Lakes region costs about $5 billion per year.
\
¥ About 24 billion gallons of raw and partially treated sewage are dumped into the Great Lakes each year due to overwhelmed and aging sewage systems. The results include dead fish, closed beaches, and respiratory and intestinal illnesses in humans.
\
¥ The Great Lakes region has lost more than half of its original wetlands, which serve as habitat for fish and wildlife, filter polluted runoff, and help stop erosion.
\
¥ Due in part to global warming as well as population shifts, the southwest in particular is expected to increasingly suffer water shortages. To date, there is no federal prohibition on diverting Great Lakes water to states or nations outside the basin
\
¥ Michigan has radioactive wastes at four current or past commercial nuclear reactors that eventually will need to be moved to a permanent national depository. Thirty-one reactors are located in the Great Lakes basin that are producing wastes.
\
¥ While 17 highly polluted sites in Michigan on the Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund priority list have been cleaned up, 65 priority sites still await action. Michigan needs help from the federal government to cover most of the estimated $1 billion in cleanup costs.
\
¥ About 9,000 underground tanks have leaked petroleum in Michigan, threatening ground water. The estimated cost to decontaminate the areas is $3 billion. Michigan only gets about $1.5 million annually from the federal government to deal with the problem.

Al Gore has won. That was the message from Ford Chief Executive Alan Mulally last week, bluntly expressing his industry's view that the debate over global warming ""has passed.""
\
""It is time for a conversation about what we, as a society, intend to do to address"" climate change and energy security, Mulally says. Curiously, Ford's consumer marketing finds climate change low on the list of buyer's concerns even as Mulally predicts that it is ""going to be one of the most important considerations to the customers that buy our product.""
\
But this is not about consumers. What is driving the auto industry's embrace of climate change is an immediate political problem: the new Democratic congressional leadership is hell-bent on fast-tracking climate change legislation.
\
The auto industry has judged that America is in a cannibalistic industry-against-industry contest to minimize exposure to government rules.
\
""If you aren't at the table, you are on the menu,"" says Dave McCurdy, head of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers (AAM), chief lobbying group for the nine major automakers. McCurdy recognizes that the ""menu's"" only current item is filet of auto courtesy of federal fuel-efficiency laws.
\
Never mind that the ""consensus"" on climate change is an illusion. The United Nations International Panel on Climate has come under withering attack from some of the biggest names in climatology: Richard Lindzen, Christopher Landsea, Timothy Ball, John Christy, Paul Reiter and others detail deep flaws in its data. More important, a panel of Nobel laureate economists has concluded that the costs of climate solutions far exceed any benefit.
\
But the experts haven't won a gold statuette.
\
Oscar vs. Dingell
\
""This is an issue because Al Gore gets an Oscar,"" AAM's McCurdy says. A former red-state Democratic congressmen from Oklahoma whose family drives a gasoline-electric hybrid and personally advocates higher energy taxes, McCurdy may seem an unlikely choice to represent Detroit iron. But automakers believe the clock is ticking against them, and they are betting two Democrats -- McCurdy and aging auto champion Rep. John Dingell of Dearborn -- can talk sense to Washington.
\
History suggests the only way to affect energy consumption is to tax it. But while 80 percent of Americans in recent polls echo Gore's climate hysteria, equally large numbers reject increased taxes as a solution.
\
Americans do not consider global warming a high priority.
\
Still determined to ""do something,"" Democratic leaders -- aided by war-weakened President Bush -- are threatening a hidden tax by hiking existing fuel-economy standards.
\
Enter Dingell and AAM and their proposal for a ""cap-and-trade"" system that would share the emissions burden across all U.S. industries. The scheme mirrors similar strictures in Europe -- part of a regulatory environment that a comprehensive Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development economic study found retarded European economic growth to half that of the U.S.
\
A study released last week by the Congressional Budget Office concludes that a cap-and-trade program would slow the U.S. economy, particularly damaging the coal and oil industries, and increasing consumer prices that ""would disproportionately affect people at the bottom of the income scale."" London's Financial Times found that Europe's cap-and-trade system is riddled with waste and trades that ""yield few if any environmental benefits.""
\
Then there is the question of whether handing over so much power to government is worth being ""at the table.""
\
General Electric provides a cautionary tale. Seeing an opportunity to advance its nuclear and wind technologies, GE was one of the first companies to break from business orthodoxy on climate and embrace carbon caps. Now, GE finds one of its key products under attack as Australia and Canada (and soon California) have banned incandescent light bulbs.
\
Now that automakers are at the table, they may still find Gore pouring gravy over them.

13,"The League of Conservation Voters has launched an ad campaign aimed at pressuring U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Brighton, to support the proposed American Clean Energy & Security Act, which includes a provision for the ""cap and trade"" of greenhouse gas emissions.\The 30-second spots will air on television stations throughout Rogers' district for the rest of the week, as well as online at www.lcv.org/rogers. Volunteers will also be making phone calls.\The ""cap-and-trade"" concept would limit the emission of pollutants while offering companies the right to sell each other permits that would allow for greater emissions. Opponents argue any costs incurred by companies to meet these caps would be passed onto consumers.\""Mike Rogers has been pretty plain in his opposition to that legislation, so the LCV is putting some pressure on him,"" said Mark Neisler, global climate-change specialist with the state league, which has teamed up with the national league on the ads.\The ad claims the congressman says ""no to clean energy, no to millions of new jobs."" It ends with ""Call Mike Rogers and tell him it's time to start believing in America again.""\Rogers spokeswoman Sylvia Warner responded to the ads by saying President Barack Obama even noted the clean energy legislation will cause electric bills to ""skyrocket.""\""Congressman Rogers supports reduction of emissions through incentive programs to buy new, cleaner cars and through increased nuclear, wind and solar power, all components of his proposed energy independence plan. He believes we need a plan that protects and creates manufacturing jobs while reducing the emissions that can impact climate change,"" Warner said in a statement.\Warner also said the bill would kill 100,000 Michigan jobs, though that figure is disputed by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.\The institute reports 540,000 new jobs will be created in Michigan by 2030 with a cap-and-trade system, citing studies from the American Council on Capital Formation and National Association of Manufacturers.\""For Rep. Rogers to be out there saying it's a job killer, there's plenty of studies out there that says this creates jobs, not just nationally, but in Michigan,"" said Kerry Duggan, campaign project manager with the national league.\A similar campaign launched earlier in the week was aimed at U.S. Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. Rogers and Blunt sit on the powerful House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The panel is set this month to take up the legislation that would impose a ""cap-and-trade"" mechanism for the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, among other things.\Duggan said plenty of businesses in the energy, chemical and manufacturing industries believe in the bill, including the Dow Chemical Co., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler LLC.\""I wouldn't call this an attack campaign,"" Duggan said.

The proposed ""cap and trade"" system for reducing carbon dioxide emissions being pushed by the Obama administration is a tax. If adopted, it will reduce economic growth in the United States, damage Michigan manufacturing, raise consumer costs sharply, and increase our reliance on unstable sources of oil, all in the false hope of improving the environment.
\
To make any economic sense, the proposed cap-and-trade tax would require that Congress know what the environmental cost per ton of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere is and compare it to the benefits from the goods and services that would be lost under the emissions allotment. It is clear that no one in Congress has made such a determination and that allowances are being set to generate an enormous amount of tax revenue regardless of what the benefits to the environment are or the costs to the economy.
\
First, there is not even a scientific consensus that global warming is being caused by man-made carbon emissions. S. Fred Singer, former director of the U.S. National Weather Satellite Service, argues persuasively in his book, Unstoppable Global Warming, that global warming is a natural occurring phenomenon.
\
Second, it may be more cost effective to find a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than to prevent it from getting into the atmosphere in the first place. Richard Branson has offered a $25 million prize to anyone who finds a commercially viable method of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
\
Third, the effect on the environment of reductions in U.S. emissions is likely to be overwhelmed by emissions from China, now the largest and fastest growing emitter of greenhouse gases, and other emerging economies.
\
The requirement that electric utilities, oil companies, and large manufacturers buy allowances in order to emit carbon dioxide will increase the cost of producing manufactured goods since they will have to invest in a more expensive production process or purchase carbon allowances. The increased costs will result in lower production, fewer jobs, and higher prices.
\
Because Michigan relies on coal-fueled power plants for 65 percent of its electricity, our state will be particularly hard hit. Manufacturing is likely to move overseas to countries that are not beset by higher environmental costs. U.S. manufacturers will face added uncertainties since the cost of emission allowances will almost surely fluctuate. As the cost of allowances rise and fall, there will be less incentive to expand or add new manufacturing facilities.
\
The $650 million in cap and trade taxes will reduce the ability of our domestic oil and gas companies to produce and will increase the nation's reliance on energy supplies from regions of the world that are unstable or unfriendly. With increasing unemployment, financial instability, and uncertain political conditions in the Middle East, this is no time to boost taxes on energy production.
\
The notion of clamping a cap-and-trade tax on carbon dioxide emissions should be shelved until sound science has provided a reasonable estimate of the net cost of man-made emissions.

15,"With runaway energy prices stirring public debate, environmental issues that were on the back burner a year ago have leapfrogged into the limelight in the presidential campaign.\Issues like whether to open new parts of the oceans to offshore drilling or build new coal and nuclear plants, and how alternative energy ties in with climate change have become hot topics in the race between presumptive presidential nominees Sens. Barack Obama, D-Ill., and John McCain, R-Ariz.\""The environment is directly tied to energy issues, and those are fundamental to the problems we're facing now,"" said Eric Klammer, 38, Republican chairman for Michigan's 5th Congressional District. He lives in Buena Vista Township in Saginaw County.\""The economy is screwed up because of energy prices,"" he said.\Klammer said he was in elementary school when then-President Jimmy Carter told the country it needed to curb its dependence on foreign oil.\""We've had 30 years to do it and haven't done it yet,"" he said. Neither candidate is doing enough, he said, but he backs McCain.\For Genevieve Terry of Farmington Hills, a retired hospital worker, environmental issues are at the top of her list of what matters. For her, the big issue is nuclear power, which she's worried about.\""No, no, no, I don't support nuclear power,"" she said. An independent, she voted twice for President George W. Bush. Now, she's voting for Obama.\Oil, energy take center stage\Environmental issues cover a broad spectrum, from global warming to protecting the Great Lakes. In most national voter polls, those issues have been low on the scale throughout the campaign. The economy and the war in Iraq had been the top concerns. But as oil prices hit $4 per gallon this summer, before its recent retreat, attention from the public and the campaigns shifted to focus on oil and energy.\In a Quinnipiac University poll July 14-22, voters in four key swing states including Michigan said energy policy was now more important to them than the war. Voters in each state said they support offshore drilling and drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, but they're even more supportive of developing more renewable energy, such as solar and wind power and biofuels.\Michigan voters said they support building new nuclear plants, by a margin of 58%-31%, numbers in line with what voters in the other three states said. On offshore drilling, Michigan voters were slightly more likely than voters in Colorado, Minnesota and Wisconsin to approve, with 63% in favor and 32% opposed. A bare majority of voters support drilling in the Arctic refuge, with those in Michigan the highest at 53%.\Differences on policy\There are clear differences between the candidates on energy policy.\McCain supports an aggressive plan to build 45 new nuclear plants by 2030, while Obama says nuclear waste and storage issues must be resolved before new plants are built. Both candidates oppose drilling in the Arctic refuge. McCain supports offshore drilling, and Obama recently dropped his opposition to give limited support to offshore drilling in some areas that are now off-limits.\McCain and Obama both accept global warming and believe that cutting back global-warming gases is crucial. Both use market-based cap and trade plans to accomplish it, with standards set on how much carbon dioxide power and manufacturing plants can emit, and trading of those allowances permitted.\Setting caps on carbon emissions for industry is expected to be a major battle.\Doug Roberts Jr., policy director for the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, said his group wants to make sure there is a federal standard for carbon caps and that it's not done state by state.\McCain has said he backs state decisions on offshore drilling and fuel efficiency standards for cars, but he hasn't said how carbon caps would be determined. Obama would require companies to buy the right to emit carbon dioxide in an auction.\Obama says new coal plants, among the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide, shouldn't be built unless they can capture their carbon dioxide emissions. McCain says it's acceptable to build new coal plants now, but he would require retrofitting them when carbon-capturing technology is available. He would spend $2 billion a year over 15 years on that technology.\Alternative energy and biofuels\Both say they want more alternative energy and biofuels, but McCain doesn't like subsidies such as those provided now to corn farmers for corn ethanol - something he reiterated to corn farmers last week at the Iowa State Fair.\He wants to end tariffs that make importing Brazilian sugar cane ethanol prohibitive now.\Obama wants to spend $150 billion over 10 years to develop climate-friendly energy such as new biofuels, more plug-in hybrid cars, low-carbon emissions coal plants and upgrades to the electric grid to accommodate wind and solar power, even from home windmills.\Environmental groups that endorse in the presidential race have mostly chosen Obama so far. Yet McCain has had a good reputation on the environment for years.\He was among the first to say he thought global warming was real - in 2000. He has been a strong voice in preserving open space and national parks. But in 2007, the League of Conservation Voters said he missed all 15 key environment votes.\""There are few good Republican voters"" on the environment ""left in Congress,"" said Lana Pollack, director of the Michigan Environmental Council. ""McCain was among the better ones, but apparently he's got no interest in standing up for the environment when he's trying to persuade the Republican base to vote for him.""\Don't forget the Great Lakes\For voters like Paul Kripli, 44, an auto engineer from Sterling Heights, Great Lakes issues are among the most important.\""I generally vote on the environment and the economy,"" he said.\Obama's campaign said he would issue a Great Lakes platform this summer, and on the candidate's Web site, he lists the Great Lakes as one of four main environmental issues.\As a senator from Chicago, he has said he knows the importance of healthy lakes to tourism, recreation and business in the region.\He supports the Great Lakes Compact, designed to prevent water diversion, and has sponsored a bill for $20 billion in funding pending before Congress to do cleanups in the lakes. His Web site says he helped get funding for the Asian carp barrier at Lake Michigan through Congress.\McCain is a westerner who cares about wilderness and preserving wildlife, also key issues in conservation-minded Michigan.\He has said he wouldn't allow water diversion from the lakes, and his campaign staff scoffed at the idea he would ever change his mind. In fact, he's been pushing efforts to get westerners to conserve water.\Neither candidate has talked about invasive species, such as zebra mussels, a critical issue for the Great Lakes, said Dave Nyberg, director of policy for the Michigan United Conservation Clubs, which doesn't endorse candidates.\""But we're encouraged by any type of focus on the Great Lakes,"" he said.

16,"It is tragic that Congress has run out of gas, so to speak, on energy reform that would include tackling the greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet. At best, that means the issue could make good fodder for the campaign debates that will take place this fall.\But Americans live in an at-worst economy, and the environment will surely take a back seat to concerns about jobs, taxes and other aspects of everyone's financial security. On top of that, those who oppose a cap on emissions have spread an extraordinary amount of hype about the costs of ratcheting back on carbon dioxide, warning that any change would blow yet another hole in most families' well-being. What such fear-mongers neglect to explain is that a carbon-based future looks even more expensive.\For now, Congress could redeem itself by passing strong energy-efficiency measures: helping businesses and households to insulate, upgrade electrical systems and lights, and replace appliances, for example. There are still huge gains to be made in what are known as nega-watts -- removing demand bit by bit from the electrical grid.\But other measures, such as setting minimum thresholds for alternative sources of energy, seem pointless without simultaneously setting a price on carbon-based fuels, be it through a cap-and-trade system on emissions or through a direct carbon tax. Many states, including Michigan, already have set standards for alternate sources of electricity, and federal action ought to be reserved for a well-coordinated strategy that takes global warming gases seriously, once and for all.\A coordinated strategy can take the edge off of increasing energy costs by ensuring that people on fixed incomes and in low-income households get rebates. It should also help ensure that the most efficient types of alternative energy -- not just the most heavily subsidized -- rise to the top. It may help spur more decentralized, even home-based, solutions.\Meanwhile, inaction has its own fallout. Electric utilities face great risk in their long-range planning when they don't know whether they'll face emissions controls for greenhouse gases. Customers will pay the price for decades if their local utilities guess wrong.\Inaction also raises the probability that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will step into the breach, as the U.S. Supreme Court has said it can, and implement emissions controls by regulation. That may prove to be more excruciating than the current contentiousness.\Eventually the results of an incoherent energy policy will inflict the kind of pain that makes Americans demand something real from Congress. Unfortunately, it looks to be a while yet before enough elected officials feel the heat."
17,"Dingell drafts climate change bill\He says he is working on new proposal that has better chance of passage than one Senate rejected.\By David ShepardsonDetroit News Washington Bureau\WASHINGTON -- U.S. Rep. John Dingell, D-Dearborn, said Wednesday he is working to complete a wide-ranging climate change proposal that would stand a better chance of passage than a Senate bill rejected last week.\Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has oversight over climate bills, said a Senate bill rejected Friday was ""poorly written"" and never had a chance of passage.\The Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act got 48 votes -- 12 votes shy of ending debate and putting it to a vote. The setback means it likely won't be considered again this year.\Michigan Sens. Carl Levin, D-Detroit, and Debbie Stabenow, D-Lansing, voted to end debate, but both joined a letter signed by eight other colleagues that said they wouldn't have voted for the final climate bill.\The bill's supporters say it would have cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 70 percent by 2050 over current levels in part by using a cap-and-trade system, which allows carbon emitters to buy and sell permits. That system would have raised $6.7 trillion over the next 40 years and some of the money would have gone to help people pay for higher energy costs. Under one version of the bill domestic automakers would have received $68 billion in retooling funds.\Republicans warned the Lieberman-Warner bill could have sharply increased the cost of gasoline and reduced economic growth. Democrats said it would have created millions of new ""green-collar"" jobs.\Dingell told the Motor &amp; Equipment Manufacturers Association, the auto supplier trade association, at a luncheon on Capitol Hill Wednesday that the climate bill he was working on would be a ""balanced, decent, sensible piece of legislation."" Passing a climate bill ""is not only a matter of almost supreme technical difficulty,"" Dingell said, ""but it is a matter of extraordinary political concern, as the Senate found out.""\Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said that though the Senate bill was defeated, last week's relatively close vote was nonetheless a ""another milestone in the fight against global warming.""\Dingell said that industry and labor would have to work together to get a climate bill they could live with. ""The environmentalists and others -- including the do-gooders -- who care relatively little about your industry are able to be quite frankly outshouted,"" Dingell told the auto supplier group. ""The rightness of your cause is not necessarily measured by the volume of your voice.""\Credit: David Shepardson / The Detroit News"
18,"WASHINGTON - Barely 5 feet tall, Sen. Barbara Boxer stepped onto a wooden box to reach the microphone at a global warming rally.

""We are saying to our friends in the world, we understand America has to step up to the plate.""\Boxer, a California Democrat who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, now faces a tougher audience. She is trying to push legislation through the Senate that would cut carbon dioxide emissions by two-thirds nationwide by 2050.\Dems aim for vote this session\The warming bill was one of several major pieces of unfinished business when members of Congress adjourned for their holiday break. Senators also must resume work on a farm bill, Iraq policy and children's health care when they return today. The House reconvened last week.\The climate measure faces long odds this session - because of election year politics, opposition from industry groups and Republicans who say the bill would hurt the economy.\Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid wants to hold a vote on the bill before the Senate breaks May 23 for Memorial Day recess. If it's approved, senators still would have to work out a deal with the House.\""Global warming is here,"" said Reid, D-Nev. ""We as Americans have to set the example. We've got to do it.""\Experts maintain that the United States, the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, must significantly reduce its carbon footprint soon or face the severe consequences of a warmer climate.\Few style points\At times blunt, Boxer wins applause from supporters who see her as an ardent environmental advocate.\But some say Boxer's feisty style - she once questioned Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's truthfulness - makes it tough for her to work with Republicans. With a 51-49 majority in the Senate, Democrats often must work with the GOP to get to the 60-vote threshold needed to pass controversial legislation.\Boxer supports a bill that would set up a cap-and-trade system requiring U.S. companies to trade credits in order to release carbon into the atmosphere. It was introduced by Sens. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and John Warner, R-Va.\The United States, which has the world's largest coal reserves, gets nearly half of its electricity from coal-fired plants that spew carbon.\Luke Popovich, spokesman for the National Mining Association, says the bill would increase energy costs and not make a dent in climate change: ""It's called global warming. It's not American warming.""\Even if the Senate fails to act on the bill this year, Boxer says she'll keep the pressure on, saying she stands to gain support for it after the November elections. Democrats are expected to gain seats.\""This is an issue the American people care about,"" she said.

More jobs destroyed
\
Michigan AFL-CIO President Mark Gaffney's assertions may indeed be true that cap-and-trade legislation will create green jobs, as far as it goes (""Cap-and-trade bill creates green jobs,"" June 17). An even more true headline would read: Cap-and-trade destroys jobs -- far more than it creates. Of course, taking money from some industries and giving it to others is going to create jobs in the receiving industries. How can anyone believe it is not going to destroy jobs in those industries from which the revenue is taken?

The climate crisis is damaging our economy, our environment and our health. We cannot ignore it any longer. A World Bank study shows that increased storm surges caused by global warming will expose 52 million people worldwide to the risk of catastrophic storm floods and create $122 billion in losses to developing countries. Clean energy is the smarter, cheaper and better way to build a strong, more prosperous America. Some studies show clean energy creates two or even three times more jobs than fossil fuel.

Rely on oil, not taxes
\
Why would federal legislators want to pass a hidden tax in the form of cap-and-trade down to the consumers? To line their pockets. We in America are not dependent on foreign oil. We have plenty of oil under our soil and off of our shores that our American-owned oil companies are restricted from exploring for. How many jobs in America would be created if we just used our resources and not relied on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for oil? The Earth is not warming from the effects of fossil fuel; it's cooling on its own natural cycle.

Pollution may increase
\
If you set up a system to tax companies' carbon output, how will companies react? Some companies will trade away their right to produce carbon and go out of business. Others will move their manufacturing to other nations that do not participate in cap and trade (such as China and India). If products are produced in the United States, they are subject to strict pollution laws and are powered by cleaner sources of energy. If produced in China or India, it is extremely likely that carbon emissions will actually increase. Under a real world assessment, carbon cap-and-trade will most likely cost American jobs, increase the cost of products and increase carbon output worldwide.

22,"Getting to cleaner energy will not be easy, and it will not be cheap. But business as usual could cost Michigan even more.\When critics cite the cost of renewable energy, they generally neglect to mention that all energy will be getting more expensive. Michigan's electricity needs have already outgrown in-state supplies. Increased demand virtually ensures higher prices even by sticking with the status quo, which means Michigan utilities buying more power from sources in other states or building new coal and/or nuclear plants.\So it makes sense to meet as much of the increased demand as possible with renewable, nonpolluting energy sources that are local - wind, solar, methane gas leaving landfills, and so on - while simultaneously ratcheting up conservation measures at home and in factories, offices and stores.\For electricity, the crucial question is whether enough power is available for cooling on the hottest, muggiest afternoons in the summer when utilities hit their peak load. In a perfect world, the answer would come not in new power plants but in reasonable agreements with customers to cut back their use on those days. No electricity is more expensive than the spot purchases made to keep every last air-conditioner running full blast.\But Michigan has barely begun to tap into innovations that conserve energy or make it sustainable even on regular days. Nor has it unleashed its own populace to experiment. As the people writing elsewhere on these pages point out, gains can come in the form of recycled energy, so no bit of heat or light gets wasted, and in new technology as well as alternative power.\Conservation is as important as finding new ways to generate electricity. Rather than a single transforming solution, a clean-energy future is likely to be made up of small applications that come together like a jigsaw puzzle to form a new energy landscape.\The rewards will come not just in savings, but in air that is cleaner and easier to breathe. Stepping away from more fossil fuels to produce electricity also will prepare Michigan for the day when either a national carbon tax or cap-and-trade system on CO{-2} emissions will make electricity even more expensive.\Fossil-fuel electric plants account for about 40% of U.S. carbon dioxide production, with no decrease in sight. Despite the economy, electric demand rose slightly in Michigan last year. Carbon dioxide released from the state's power plants rose even faster - 5% from 2006 to '07, according to the Environmental Integrity Project.\But even discounting global warming concerns, Michigan will benefit from change. The Legislature must proceed with electricity bills that open the floodgates to new forms of energy and put a premium on conservation. The state's utilities need a stable financial platform so they can embrace alternatives; hence, it is essential to return to more regulation. Then the field should be wide open for alternative energy suppliers and even for home-grown experiments to tie into the electric grid.\For Michigan, alternative energy, new technology and conservation can and should be goals in themselves.\(SIDEBAR)\Clean and green\A green Earth is first of all a clean Earth.

Industrialized America has read the political tea leaves and apparently decided to consolidate its losses rather than continue the fight against proponents of the manmade climate change myth.
\
The first indication came several months ago when ExxonMobil announced it would no longer fund the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a think tank promoting free-market environmentalism that argued against the global warming hysteria.
\
With Democrats controlling Congress, ExxonMobil acknowledged a growing political tidal wave that is flooding the islands of ""deniers"" without consideration of their scientific arguments.
\
Other major corporations are following the oil giant's lead. General Motors has joined Dow Chemical Co., Johnson & Johnson, Shell, and 10 others at the U.S. Climate Action Partnership in seeking to spread the certain pain to come from government mandates involving a reduction in greenhouse gasses.
\
The move to join the consortium makes sense at GM, since Democrats want to raise the fuel economy fleet average to 35 miles per gallon by 2020.
\
The auto industry has called this goal unrealistic. The United Auto Workers has warned that such a mandate would cost more than 20,000 jobs. And vehicle prices would no doubt climb. But the green lobby presses on.
\
There's no sense for companies to fight it any longer. So GM has taken the next best step in joining USCAP, hoping to diffuse the coming pain of heavier regulation over a wider range of industries.
\
""We think it's time to look at a more comprehensive, forward-looking strategy that is economywide in scope,"" said Elizabeth Lowery, the GM vice president for environment, energy and safety policy.
\
GM has not done a 180-degree turn and acknowledge the claims of California and environmentalists who maintain that carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles are poisonous. Lowery told me flatly, ""CO2 is not a pollutant.""
\
Even so, Lowery explained that GM will continue its ongoing effort to cut carbon dioxide emissions while pursuing this new shared-pain philosophy through USCAP with a ""cap and trade policy.""
\
""Today, you have the transportation sector which has CAFE for example, which is a carbon constraint, but there aren't constraints on other industries,"" Lowery said. ""We think we have a chance working with USCAP leader companies and environmental groups to do so.""
\
GM's new policy is smart but risky. Already, the Sierra Club has dismissed the USCAP effort as a ""green scam,"" signaling that environmental groups want no compromise.
\
The Sierra Club is on record calling for an end to the fossil fuel age and a phase-out of nuclear power.
\
Now it has served notice that the honest efforts of industry to reach a middle ground, no matter how costly, are not enough.
\
The camel's nose is under the tent. If the rest of the beast follows, GM and its partners may be sorry they didn't continue the fight.

The carbon credit trading proposal that the Bush administration is lobbying for in Congress will transfer money from the Big Three automakers to their Japanese competitors. That's a bad scenario for Michigan's auto workers.
\
The proposal from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is expected to be included in an upcoming bill. It calls for a cap-and-trade system for auto emissions.
\
Here's how it likely would work: The government would set a limit on the amount of carbon dioxide automakers could emit into the environment through their plants and products. Companies that exceed the limit would have to cut back production or buy credits from other companies that come in under the limit.
\
That's how the government attacked acid rain and Clean Air Act issues. But the idea is unrealistic for automakers because of the sharply different product lines offered by the Big Three and their foreign competitors.
\
The domestic automakers make the bulk of their money off larger vehicles. The Asians specialize in smaller cars. The credit trading system would force the Big Three to pay substantial fees to the Asians to stay in compliance. That would cost auto jobs.
\
""Why would we take cash they (the Big Three) don't have and give it to their competitors?"" U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Brighton, asks.
\
Good question. Domestic policy that penalizes the American automakers will only hurt American taxpayers. The carbon credit trading proposal should be scrapped.
\
Assault on autos
\
Plans the Bush administration is pushing in addition to a cap-and-trade system on carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles:
\
¥ Reducing gasoline consumption by 20 percent in 10 years.
\
¥ Increasing fuel economy standards for cars 4 percent a year beginning in 2009.
\
¥ Boosting alternative fuels, such as ethanol, to 35 billion gallons by 2017, up from 7.5 billion by 2012.

""All of us can do something in our own lives to make a difference,"" thundered former Vice President Al Gore, while speaking about climate change at last month's Academy Awards when ""An Inconvenient Truth"" won best documentary Oscar. On Wednesday, Gore continued his call to action against global warming on Capitol Hill as he testified before House and Senate committees.
\
The frenzy surrounding the former vice president will no doubt lead many lawmakers to suggest that individual states or the whole country should adopt a cap and trade system similar to that in place in the European Union.
\
Through a system called ""cap and trade,"" many members of Congress and governors from both coasts expect to reduce greenhouse gases by expanding this program to every sector of the U.S. economy. That's an option few businesses can afford because of its well-documented drain on jobs and economic growth.
\
Here's how it would work: To reduce greenhouse gases, the government would set a limit - or cap - on pollutant emissions.
\
Companies are given emission credits (some plans require companies to purchase all the credits they need) allowing them to emit specific amounts of greenhouse gases. If they need more, they must purchase them from companies that have credits left over.
\
Recently, the European Union implemented a carbon-credit trading program, after pledging under the Kyoto Protocol to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 8% below 1990 levels by 2010.
\
Today, their emission trading system (ETS) appears to be failing. The European Environmental Agency projects that the EU will emit 7% more CO2 in 2010 than it did in 1990 unless Europe adopts costly new measures to reduce fossil fuel use.
\
Meanwhile, the cost of basic utilities has risen for many Europeans. In Britain, for example, electricity leapt by over 34% in 2005. Part of that increase was due to the emission trading system. And in mid-2006, Greece's electricity prices rose dramatically after the country's main electric company ran out of credits.
\
Unfortunately, many policymakers have not learned the lessons from our European friends. Multiple state legislatures are considering some type of legislation calling for cap and trade. Governors from five Western states recently agreed to form a similar alliance like those in the Northeastern states under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.
\
It's highly unlikely that any state, regional or national cap-and-trade system would work better -- or cost less -- in America. Economic research shows that if the Kyoto Protocol targets (reducing emissions to 7 percent below 1990 levels) were adopted, America's gross domestic product or economic output would drop between 1 percent to 4 percent annually in 2010, costing almost 2 million jobs.
\
Imposing the McCain/Lieberman bill, which requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels by 2010, would also significantly hurt Michigan's economy. Residential electricity prices are projected to rise by 12 to 30 percent, household income falls by up to $791 and there would be up to 33,000 fewer jobs in by 2010 compared with the baseline forecast, according to an analysis by CRA International.
\
Proposals like McCain/Lieberman would seriously harm Detroit's auto industry, as both union and management leaders noted earlier this month in a joint appearance before Congress.
\
So profits would sink and jobs would vanish. That's a high price to pay for a negligible benefit to the environment.
\
The U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research has calculated that even if the Kyoto Protocol were implemented by every industrialized nation, the global impact would be only 0.07 degree Celsius by 2050 -- too small an amount for scientists to detect.
\
Meanwhile, U.S. emissions are already falling as a share of global emissions, and the amount of energy used to produce a dollar of output is falling faster in the United States than in Europe. And China's carbon dioxide emissions are expected to exceed those of the United States by about 2009.
\
So what should be done?
\
As a first step, Congress should follow the prescription of the 2005 energy bill and approve $52 million in seed money for the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (AP6).
\
AP6 is comprised of China, India, Japan, South Korea, the United States and Australia, which together encompass half the world's population, use about half the world's energy and emit about half of all greenhouse gases.
\
And unlike the Kyoto Protocol's mandatory reductions, the AP6 partnership focuses on practical steps to both reduce emissions and promote economic development. These efforts include the introduction of new technology at power plants, methods of capturing and storing carbon dioxide and cleaner coal mining.
\
Considering that the economies of China and India are growing rapidly, transferring the cleanest, most energy efficient technologies to these countries will yield significant global benefits -- both economically and in greenhouse gas reduction.
\
If Gore wants to make a personal difference in the fight against climate change, he should support the AP6, a practical approach designed to reduce both global energy poverty and greenhouse gas emission growth.

26,"Though Democratic presidential candidates are unified on reversing President Donald Trump's scaling back of climate change efforts, differences emerge among the candidates on how nuclear power, natural gas and the controversial Green New Deal fit into their plans.\Climate change and environmental issues are front and center priorities for Democratic voters.\A survey of likely Democratic presidential primary voters in Michigan, conducted for the nonprofit environmental group Michigan League of Conservation Voters found 75% of respondents see climate change as a very serious problem or a crisis. The survey, done by the Global Strategy Group in mid-December, also showed 86% of likely primary voters would be more apt to support a candidate who has a plan to take immediate action on climate change by moving the United States to a 100% clean energy economy — 21% of respondents said they would disqualify a candidate without such a plan.\Lisa Wozniak, executive director of the league, based in Ann Arbor, said she and counterparts across the country are urging the Democratic candidates to prioritize and publicly commit to ambitious plans to combat climate change.\""We're challenging them to prove that climate action is a top priority to them,"" she said. ""What are they really doing to have the biggest and boldest plan?""\Protecting Michigan's drinking water and the Great Lakes from toxic contamination topped the list of environmental priorities in choosing a candidate in the Global Strategy Group survey, at 47%. And respondents almost unanimously — 97% — support immediate action to set tougher standards for PFAS chemicals and to force the military to clean up PFAS contamination in communities near military bases.\The idea that people have to choose between the environment or a good economy is a ""false dichotomy,"" Wozniak said.\""It has never been less true in the task before us, which is to protect our climate and our fresh water,"" she said. ""I believe we will see economic gain in the investments we make.""\Candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren most enthusiastically embrace the Green New Deal, a nonbinding House resolution introduced by Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Edmund Markey of Massachusetts. That plan calls for the U.S. to meet 100% of its energy demand through clean, renewable, zero-emission energy sources via a 10-year mobilization, among numerous other goals, including combating inequality and providing access to quality, affordable health care.\Chloe Grigsby, 21, of Muskegon, is a senior at Michigan State University, studying comparative cultures and politics. She calls herself a ""definite voter"" in Michigan's March 10 Democratic presidential primary, and in the Nov. 3 general election.\Climate change ""has been hugely important for me, especially as a young person in the generation that's going to really have to deal with the brunt of the issues that climate change is going to cause,"" she said.\Grigsby said she has been disappointed in the direction of Trump's administration — ""and the country in general"" — on climate and environmental matters. Trump has characterized climate change as a hoax and scaled back environmental regulations and protections for national parks, she noted.\""Not only are we not advancing, but I think we're moving backwards on protecting the climate,"" she said.\Grigsby supports Sanders for president. The independent U.S. senator from Vermont is running for the Democratic nomination.\""For me, the Green New Deal is huge — he helped author that,"" she said. ""His platform is the strongest in terms of spending to combat climate change. I feel like that's what we need in a time where if we don't start repairing the damage now, the damage that gets done is going to be more costly for our country in the long run.""\Critics of the Green New Deal cite its likely costs — the conservative think tank American Action Forum put the cost of implementing Ocasio-Cortez's and Markey's version at up to $93 trillion, or about four-and-a-half times the entire gross domestic product for the U.S. last year.\But that dollar amount has been disputed by fact-checkers. The Green New Deal is more policy aspirations than specifics, and projections of its astronomical cost mostly involve parts of the proposal not directly pertaining to a clean energy transformation. Projections also typically fail to factor any positive economic benefits or job expansion from a transition to cleaner energy and new, more efficient technologies, proponents contend.\Sanders takes the clean energy piece of his plan under the Green New Deal banner even farther than Ocasio-Cortez and Markey, proposing $16.3 trillion to reach 100% renewable energy for electricity and transportation within 10 years and a ""complete decarbonation of the economy by 2050.""\Among the provisions of Sanders' plan is a five-year guarantee of wages for displaced workers in the fossil fuel industry.\Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, calls for a $10 trillion plan to achieve:\Domestic net-zero emissions by 2030, meaning that any emissions are balanced by an equivalent amount of greenhouse gas reductions\100% ""clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy in electricity generation"" by 2035\100% zero emissions for all new light-duty passenger vehicles, medium-duty trucks, and all buses by 2030\100% zero-carbon pollution for all new commercial and residential buildings\One of the most popular alternatives often cited to reduce carbon emissions — nuclear energy, which produces zero atmospheric carbon but instead produces problematic radioactive waste — gets a thumbs-down from Sanders and Warren, among others.\Sanders' plan calls for stopping the construction of new nuclear plants, and phasing out existing ones through the nonrenewal of federal licenses.\""We know that the toxic waste byproducts of nuclear plants are not worth the risks of the technology's benefit, especially in light of lessons learned from the Fukushima meltdown and the Chernobyl disaster,"" Sanders states on his campaign's website. ""To get to our goal of 100 percent sustainable energy, we will not rely on any false solutions like nuclear, geoengineering, carbon capture and sequestration, or trash incinerators.""\Warren, at a September ""climate crisis town hall"" hosted by CNN, said she believes nuclear energy should be phased out by 2035.\One other remaining Democratic presidential candidate, U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, has also professed her opposition to nuclear energy as part of a climate change solution.\""I support the carbon neutrality goals of the Green New Deal and the awareness it has brought across the country on the critical issues of energy independence and the climate crisis,"" Gabbard states on her campaign website. ""However, I do not support 'leaving the door open' to nuclear power unless and until there is a permanent solution to the problem of nuclear waste. I believe we need to invest in 100% renewable and safe energy sources like wind, solar, and geothermal.""\More than 60,000 tons of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel is stored on the shores of four of the five Great Lakes — in some cases, mere yards from the water line — in still-growing stockpiles because promised long-term repositories for the waste in both the U.S. and Canada have not yet materialized.\In contrast, former Vice President Joe Biden calls for a continuation of nuclear power, and studying the use of small, modular, lower-cost nuclear reactors and devising better ways to address the nuclear waste storage problem.\Biden's $5 trillion climate plan — with $1.7trillion of that money coming from federal sources and the rest from states, local governments and private investors — calls for ""a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions no later than 2050."" Among its provisions is expanded infrastructure spending that also addresses the impacts of a changing climate.\Biden touts the accomplishments of ""the Obama-Biden Administration,"" including limits on carbon pollution, doubling fuel economy standards for cars and trucks, expanding renewable, clean energy in the U.S. and helping enact the international Paris Climate Accord, a global action plan to fight climate change.\But that eight-year administration record swings both ways. It means Biden is also wedded to former President Barack Obama's ""all-of-the-above"" energy strategy that, while preserving jobs and increasing energy security, has helped lead to major expansion of America's production and exportation of petroleum, as well as a significant spike in natural gas production — controversial accomplishments among 2020 likely Democratic voters.\Biden's talk has been tough on the topic on the campaign trail. At a New Hampshire stop in September, Biden told an audience member, ""I want you to look at my eyes. I guarantee you. I guarantee you. We're going to end fossil fuel.""\The Trump administration last November formally notified the United Nations that it intends to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord, enacted in December 2015 in which all of the planet's 197 nations pledged to combat climate change and adapt to its impacts. The United States — the world's largest historical emitter of carbon and the second-highest emitter now, behind China — under the agreement committed to cutting overall greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025.\All of the Democratic candidates say they would recommit to the Paris agreement.\One fossil fuel is natural gas, and though it has about half of the carbon emissions of oil and coal, it has proven a point of contention for the Democratic candidates.\Some, like Minnesota U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, support natural gas' use as a ""transition fuel."" Other candidates see gas' carbon emissions as still too problematic.\Warren has called for a ""total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases for drilling offshore and on public lands,"" a view shared by other Democratic candidates, as well as a nationwide ban on the controversial practice of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in which water and chemicals are injected at high pressures into the ground to break up mineral layers and release oil and gas for capture.\Sanders, with co-sponsors, recently introduced in the U.S. Senate a bill to ban fracking nationwide by 2025.\Other Democratic candidates who have supported a fracking ban include Gabbard, billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. Opposed to fracking bans, in addition to Klobuchar, are Biden; former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg; New York billionaire Mike Bloomberg; New York millionaire Andrew Yang; former Maryland U.S. Rep. John Delaney and Colorado U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet.\A citizens group in Michigan has attempted since 2012 to place a proposal on the ballot to ban fracking in the state. The Committee to Ban Fracking in Michigan's 2016 effort toward a ballot initiative failed amid a dispute over whether signatures collected more than 180 days earlier could be counted toward the necessary signatures to force a ballot measure. A new Michigan law signed by then-Gov. Rick Snyder that year codified the 180-day signature limit, but the Charlevoix-based committee continues to challenge that law's constitutionality.\Willie Graham Jr., 42, a lifelong Detroit resident and barber at Detroit Barber Co. on Michigan Avenue, said he has voted in every city, state and national election since he was 18.\His candidate this time around is Bloomberg.\""He's putting his money where his mouth is,"" Graham said. ""He's pledged that if he loses, he will spend his money on getting elected whoever the (Democratic) candidate is. That's putting the people first.""\Environmental policy is only one of several issues that drive Graham's vote, he said. He's also interested in addressing economic disparity and a lack of opportunity for many, and doing more to help homeless people and veterans, he said.\""They're not only drilling — they're fracking for oil. It's messing up the Earth,"" he said. ""When those polar ice caps melt, that's going to flood everybody who lives on the edge of the water — the rich people who aren't doing enough now.""\Bloomberg, however, is not among the Democratic candidates who supports a fracking ban. He has, however, joined other candidates in calling for a moratorium on oil and gas drilling on federal lands and to ""stop the rush to build new gas plants"" for energy, as utilities transition away from coal-burning.\Bloomberg's climate plan doesn't go as far as the Green New Deal proposals, calling for a 50% reduction in carbon emissions across the U.S. by 2050, with 80% clean energy usage ""by the end of his second term of office."" Among Bloomberg's plans is to focus research grants and funding on the communities most affected by coal and other fossil fuel pollution, which are often majority impoverished or populated with people of color.\Buttigieg's $2 trillion climate change plan calls for zero emissions from electricity generation and from new motor vehicles by 2035, creating a ""net-zero emissions society no later than 2050."" He proposes creating a $250billion American Clean Energy Bank to fund locally led clean energy projects, particularly in disadvantaged communities; a 10-year, $250 billion Global Investment Initiative, and grant-making ""Regional Resilience Hubs"" to help communities with climate change-related vulnerabilities.\Buttigieg also supports a carbon tax.\""The key to making a carbon tax work for everyday Americans is to rebate out the value to the American people every year, and do it with a progressive formula so that most people are better off than before,"" Buttigieg said in an interview with City Lab last November.\""The idea of a carbon tax is not to suck money out of the economy and bring it into the government — at least not for me. For me, the idea is to make sure that our prices more accurately reflect the true cost, including the cost to our own future, of things like fossil fuels. We can do that without making most Americans worse off economically if we have a rebate — a dividend, if you will — that goes out to every American based on what's been collected.""\Among the other candidates supporting a carbon tax are Biden, Yang and Delaney.\Sanders, who touted taxing carbon in his 2016 presidential run, now favors ""massively raising taxes on corporate polluters' and investors' fossil fuel income and wealth.""\Steyer proposes a cap-and-trade system, a government-set limit on total carbon emissions, with businesses purchasing credits for every ton of carbon pollution that emanates from their operations annually.\A 2013 report by the Congressional Budget Office concluded that carbon tax or cap-and-trade plans ""would have a negative effect on the economy,"" causing higher prices that diminished the purchasing power of people's earnings; reducing employment and investment, and disproportionately impacting lower-income households.\Proponents of cap-and-trade, however, say it allows the market to determine a price on carbon, spurring innovation and cleaner operation over time.\Some of the Democratic presidential candidates have also addressed per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, the nonstick ""forever chemicals"" once used on stain guards and Teflon pots and pans that persist in the environment and can cause cancer and other health problems. Michigan has 70 known locations where PFAS levels in drinking water exceed the federal government's 70 parts per trillion health advisory limit. But that limit is now regarded as outdated and not protective enough.\In a July op-ed, Warren said, ""As President ... I will take quick, decisive action to end PFAS use on military bases in our communities, enforce strong and effective drinking water standards, and get veterans, service members, and their families the care they need.""\Biden's website also mentions PFAS as an issue he plans to prioritize, but without specifics.\Sanders in December announced he would set tough federal standards for PFAS and other chemicals in drinking water.\""Corporate greed is threatening one of the most basic necessities of life: clean water,"" Sanders said in a statement.\Bernie 2020 Deputy Communications Director Sarah Ford added, ""It's absurd that we have to say this in America in 2020: When you turn on the tap in your home in Michigan, you have a right to expect that the water coming out is clean.""\Contact Keith Matheny: 313-222-5021 or kmatheny@freepress.com.

Regardless of the merits of the global warming argument, common sense would say we cannot continue to abuse where we live. Whether our planet is warming or dying isn't the issue. The issue is that it clearly doesn't make sense to continue to pollute the planet with gasoline engines, coal-burning industries, deforestation and the myriad chemical abuses we subject it to. Accordingly, we should always be focusing on how we can live with instead of against our environment rather than spending our time arguing over whether there is proof we are killing ourselves or not.

\
Those who claim ""they know"" that there is manmade global warming are living in the Dark Ages. When honest peer review did not happen on some of the claims made in the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that is committing fraud. When climatologists cannot get the 10-day forecast right on any consistent basis using today's models, please do not insult our intelligence by asserting those same models are accurately predicting future weather patterns.

Global surface temperature increased between the start and the end of the 20th century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concludes that most of the observed temperature increase since the middle of the 20th century was likely caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases resulting from human activity. Its conclusions have been endorsed by more than 40 scientific societies and academies. There is definitely a need to limit emissions.

Michigan was once a tropical sea, and then ended up under a mile of ice. That was 14,000 years ago. Then Earth began to warm; we don't know why, but it certainly wasn't because of man. By their recent intrigues, some scientists have done a great disservice to mankind, their respective science and, possibly, the planet Earth. I do believe, however, that we should continue to cut polluting emissions and develop clean energy -- as long as we are not overburdened by onerous laws and taxes, such as ""cap-and-trade.""

Investigation queries

Here are a few questions I think should be asked in any investigation of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill: How long had the Deepwater Horizon rig been in service; Who made the blowout preventer; and could some eco-terrorist have infiltrated the rig's factory when it was being built and sabotaged the equipment?

BP has failed us miserably. Time is running out. We need to stop this catastrophe now. They have repeatedly approached the leak with complicated devices and procedures. What is needed to stop the leak is simple devices and rudimentary tasks for the remote submersibles. We didn't expect the Lunar astronauts to perform complicated physical tasks in such an alien, remote environment and the same limitations apply here.

Stop cap-and-trade
\
President Obama talked for about 15 minutes during his speech on the Gulf oil spill and said absolutely nothing but hinted at a coming cap and trade bill. If Democrats now attempt to use this crisis to pass the asinine bill it will decimate what is left of the economy. What good will it do to raise the cost of everything in the face of this crisis? Wind and solar energy are fine but they will not replace coal, oil and nuclear power, and alternative energy should be built and developed with private money, not government subsidies.

Climate change is real
\
Frank Beckmann argues that climate legislation is unnecessary because carbon dioxide emissions have no impact on the Earth's climate (""Climate bill gives huge powers to government,"" July 3). That argument is contrary to the findings set out in the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The IPCC, a worldwide panel of scientists, found ""unequivocal"" evidence of global warming, which was ""very likely"" due to increased greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activities. Doing nothing about global warming will, in the long run, prove much more expensive than addressing the problem now.
\
Paul Ruschmann, Canton
\
Cheap energy needed
\
The cap-and-trade bill that was passed by the House of Representatives will not have any noticeable effect on the environment. It is not a jobs bill either, since it will cost more jobs than it creates. Inexpensive energy is the mother's milk of economic growth, and anything that increases energy cost will reduce growth and jobs.

Cap, trade is a tax hike

Does Mark Gaffney really think most Americans are oblivious that cap-and-trade will be a huge tax and will drive our energy bills through the roof (""Cap-and-trade bill creates green jobs,"" June 17)? For Gaffney to tout green jobs pay more is infuriating. Of course they pay more because these green jobs are government jobs and the unions and the federal/state governments think they have an endless supply of our tax dollars.

Obama can't win war on business
\
President's programs could stifle economic growth
\
Making war on business is no way to stimulate an economy. But read between the lines of President Barack Obama's address to Congress and you find a battle plan for a broad attack on industrial America.
\
His proposals reflect a stunning disregard for the impact of government policies on economic output and a clear preference for jobs created by government spending rather than private investment.
\
The president says he wants to eliminate the George W. Bush tax cuts ""on the wealthy,"" a core promise of his campaign. But those cuts help reduce the cost of capital in America, an essential tool to helping business out of this recession. Raising the capital gains tax, as Obama proposes, will make private investment dollars even scarcer, as will hiking income taxes on those most likely to invest in the economy.
\
His cap-and-trade program to fight global warming is another massive tax increase in disguise as it would force businesses to either install expensive new equipment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions or pay other businesses for the permission to pollute. This ""tax"" would hit producing states like Michigan especially hard.
\
California companies are already struggling under that state's onerous cap-and-trade program, according to a New York Times report. CalPortland, which provides concrete for California roads and bridges, says the cost of retrofitting just one its plants will cost $200 million. So the company may close the plant instead, at a cost of 140 jobs.
\
Consider that Obama's massive infrastructure spending program will require huge amounts of concrete, and it's not hard to imagine most of that material coming from China or Mexico if a federal cap-and-trade program is enacted.
\
To address the crisis in the financial markets, Obama so far has been able to come up only with calls for new layers of regulation and oversight that will do nothing to improve liquidity. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has whiffed at two attempts to articulate a strategy for the banks and is rapidly losing the confidence of investors.
\
America's economy is the envy of the world because it provides businesses a relatively hassle-free regulatory environment with access to cheap capital markets and cheap energy. The new administration would do well to learn this lesson -- and fast.

Protest Mason bridge plan
\
I was recently stunned to learn about the city of Mason's intention to blow the entire street maintenance budget for two-plus years on a new road and bridge.
\
The proposed roadway would cross Willow Creek, connecting Franklin Farm Drive to Kipp Road. It is projected to cost well over $1 million.
\
Given the road's location, it would serve only a handful of residents and is of no benefit to the vast majority of Mason residents.
\
Because the roadway is positioned in the worst location available, it will require extensive floodplain and wetland fill, increasing the project's cost and damage to the environment.
\
To add insult to injury, the city has less damaging options that would achieve the same objectives at virtually no cost.
\
For some reason, however, Mason officials insist that this project is essential and more important than repairing our crumbling streets.
\
I would encourage all residents to contact the city of Mason in writing or at (517) 676-9155 to voice their opinion regarding our own little ""Bridge to Nowhere"" project.

U.S. needs more nukes

Barack Obama is going to stand up in front of all Americans and claim that by destroying all of our nuclear weapons the world will be a safer place. In the perfect world, this would be the case.

But, you have to use common sense when it comes to dealing with terrorists and communist countries.
\
I know for a fact that North Korea, China, Russia, Pakistan and al-Qaida extremists will not reason with the United States.

Over-rule insurers
\
What is more important: Americans' access to health care or insurance companies' profits? AIG executives' greed pales beside the greed of health insurance executives.
\
Private insurers object to any efficient Medicare-style government program for all Americans because it would control costs and compete too effectively with private companies (LSJ, April 7).
\
It is outrageous to consider rejecting quality low-cost health care for all Americans just because insurance companies object. Why should we all pay more for health care and for insurance, just to protect private insurance profits?
\
How can health insurance lobbyists ask Congress to require inefficiencies in new Medicare-style health insurance, to match the inefficiencies in private insurance?
\
How can insurance lobbyists argue with a straight face against controlling health care costs?
\
People in Michigan want dependable access to quality health care at reasonable cost. Congress must include a strong public program among our health insurance choices.
\
Will Congress again protect and enrich private insurance companies? Or will Congress listen this time to their human constituents?

Liberals need help
\
Since many liberal letter writers seem to have missed some news:
\
George Bush is no longer president. Rush Limbaugh never was president.
\
Bush and John McCain called for a new regulatory department in treasury to oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003 and 2006. Democrats Barney Frank and Barack Obama (in 2006) said not to worry, everything was OK.
\
Banking deregulation started under Bill Clinton with Obama's current advisers, Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers.
\
While Obama slams Bush's policies and actions in every speech, both here and abroad, he maintains many of the same policies.
\
While pledging not to increase taxes on the poor, he signed into law the $.62/pack cigarette tax increase that is really a poor tax, not a sin tax. And, he asks for a CO2 cap and trade law that is nothing more than an energy tax designed to fund his liberal agenda.
\
The scientific consensus on global warming is shifting to one of CO2 not being a significant issue and that man has not caused global warming.

The Detroit News editorial page and WJR held a panel Tuesday to debate whether the science on global warming supports the large increase in fuel economy standards. Portions of the debate will be broadcast this week on Frank Beckmann's WJR AM 760 show from 9 a.m. to noon. The detnews.com Web site also will be posting the video. Here are excerpts:

\
Henry Pollack, University of Michigan professor emeritus of geophysics: I have been puzzled ever since this revelation about why these particular endeavors (the e-mails of the Climate Research Unit in Britain) have been deemed so significant that they eclipse the much more abundant and diverse scientific evidence of climate change from thousands of climate scientists worldwide. ... There is much to be learned from climate science that is relevant to climate policy and that is relevant to industrial policy. As a scientist, it seems to me counterproductive and increasingly dangerous to pretend the science is seriously flawed.
\
Pat Michaels, senior fellow in environmental studies, Cato Institute and past president of the American Association of State Climatologists: If science is not flawed, it is not science. Science is an ongoing process. Climategate is not idle chit-chat when you say: ""I'm going to destroy my e-mails about the Fourth United Nations Assessment Report, and I want you to do the same."" But in the long run, the most interesting aspect of the e-mails is the vitriolic attitude toward anyone who doesn't think like this small group thinks. ... It is the subtle question that is being suppressed: It is not that human beings are warming (the planet), but how much are they warming it, and what does that mean for the future? And the fact is that the observed warming is at or certainly beneath the median range of warming projected by the United Nations.
\
U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph, member of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee: The science ought to drive the debate. One of the things I have done as the top Republican on the House Energy and Environment subcommittee is we've called for hearings (on the e-mails). To date, we have not heard back. As a result of (Climategate), I don't think the Senate will take up cap-and-trade (legislation). ... Are any of the incurred costs (like power price increases) from cap-and-trade actually going to impact the rising temperature? The answer was: No. There was no real science that it would reduce the temperature rise that some predict.
\
Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy, Competitive Enterprise Institute: Cap-and-trade would be dead regardless of whether Climategate happened or not. Climategate is a very big scandal, and it is going to get bigger. These are the key people in the IPCC (United Nations) reports, and they're not just in East Anglia (Britain) but all over the United States. These people are the lead authors and top bureaucrats on the secretariat of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It's all about transparency and sharing data and ethics. These people were manipulating the data.
\
Kathryn Clay, director of research, Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, and adjunct professor of physics, Georgetown University: Our CEOs have stepped forward with the president in announcing their support for the new national (fuel economy) program. It is driven by concerns about climate change, and the feeling that it was a prudent course of action. It was also driven by oil security. And it was driven by global pollution concerns. It is also innovation policy. Having these challenges will drive automakers to make the investments to develop the advanced technology that will have such a great effect on economies like here in Michigan.
\
Stanley ""Skip"" Pruss, Michigan's chief energy officer and director of Michigan Department of Energy, Labor & Economic Growth: This debate does inform policy. The IPCC is comprised of more than 1,000 climatologists who are reading and evaluating peer-reviewed papers that follow the methodologies of science. This group argues that we should be worried, that we are at risk. The magnitude of risk is subject to debate, but there is risk. The findings of the IPCC have been affirmed by the National Academy of Sciences and the counterparts of every other Western country in the world. So if we are policymakers, we really have to pay attention to this.
\
But the real point is that the train has already left the station. We can argue that we need to pull back, but the rest of the world is not pulling back. One hundred or more countries are on the verge of obligating themselves -- maybe not this year or next, but the following year -- to dramatic greenhouse emission reductions.

John McCain\Would reform tax code and promote entrepreneurship and business growth. Would lower corporate tax rate to 25% from 35%.\Issue Foreign Policy\Barack Obama\Opposed the Iraq war, but was not a senator at the time the war was approved.\Would remove combat troops immediately from Iraq, and have all troops out within 16 months.\Says despite the Iraq troop surge, the level of violence is still unacceptable and political gains have been few.\Would engage in direct diplomacy with Iran, without preconditions. Says: ""Not talking doesn't make us look tough - it makes us look arrogant. And it doesn't get results.""\Says he believes relations with Israel must remain strong and supports continued U.S. aid.\Says Israeli settlements are not helpful to negotiations; wants to stop Palestinian shelling from Gaza.\Cosponsored resolution against Iran and Syria's involvement in the July 2006 war and said Israel should not be pushed into cease-fire without addressing Hizballah threat; wants to stop arms support for group.\Disapproved of Jimmy Carter's meeting with Hamas, and said he would not meet with Hamas unless it renounces terrorism and recognizes Israel's right to exist.\John McCain\Voted for the Iraq war.\Would draw down troops when prudent; says he believes troops must remain until Iraq is capable of governing itself and protecting its people.\Proposed surge before President George W.

It would work this way:\Employers: Those that do not offer health coverage or pay a meaningful contribution to a plan would have to pay a portion of payroll taxes to fund the new system, a concept known in the industry as pay or play. Companies that offer health insurance would get tax breaks equal to as much as 50% of the cost of the yearly premiums.\Consumers: Adults or workers at small businesses could be eligible to buy insurance through a federal program that offers both a public plan, similar to one offered to federal employees, and private plan options from insurers that want to be part of the program.\Obama's plan would cost $50 billion to $65 billion a year, according to the campaign. Other estimates say costs could reach $1.6 trillion over 10 years.\John McCain\Wants consumers to have more choices and not be as directly tied to employer-provided insurance. Would accomplish that two ways:\*Employees who continue to get their health insurance from employers would pay income tax (but not Social Security or Medicare payroll tax) on the value of the coverage.\*To offset the higher taxes, McCain would give families a tax credit of $5,000 and individuals a tax credit of $2,500. The theory is that they might find a better deal on their own, especially since he would allow people to buy health insurance from other states.\If the individual owes no taxes, his or her insurance company would get the subsidy directly. If money was left over after insurance was paid, the person would get a check to create a health savings account to pay for other health needs.\McCain's plan would cost $1.3 trillion over 10 years, according to the campaign. In addition, creation or expansion of high-risk pools would add $70 billion to $100 billion over a decade, according to projections by leading U.S. health care organizations.\Issue Higher Education Funding and Assistance\Barck Obama\Would create a $4,000 annual tax credit for most students' community college or university tuition in return for 100 hours of community service.\Would eliminate the Federal Family Education Loan program, which is funded through private banks, and redirect that money into more aid for students.\Would increase the maximum Pell Grant from $4,050 to $5,100.\John McCain\Would divert a portion of every worker's unemployment insurance into an account that can be used to cover lost wages while a worker goes back to college to get retrained.\Would create a student loan continuity program to ensure states would help students who could be hurt if their loans are cut by the credit crunch.\Has no proposal on Pell Grants.\Issue Environment\Barack Obama\Says he believes global warming is real and the result of human actions; would make it a top priority; would include other big global-warming gas-producing nations in global talks.\Would reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020; drop to 80% of 1990 levels by 2050.\Supports a cap-and-trade program to cut global-warming gases by putting emission caps on companies; those that can reduce emissions cheaply can sell excess. Would require companies to buy the right to emit any carbon, that way companies would have to pay for every ton of emissions; they can still trade their allowances with each other.\Comes from a coal-producing state and says it's a valuable and plentiful domestic power source; says new coal plants should be built only if they use low-carbon technology; old plants should be retrofitted to capture global-warming gases.\John McCain\Says he believes global warming is real and the result of human actions; has said he would make it a top priority; introduced first bipartisan climate change bill in Congress in 2003.\Would reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020; drop to 60% of 1990 levels by 2050.\Supports a cap-and-trade program to cut global-warming gases by putting emission caps on companies; those that can reduce emissions cheaply can sell excess.

36,"Michigan is the 15th state to challenge a new federal regulation of airborne mercury pollution from electric power plants, saying it's too weak.\State officials filed a motion Wednesday with the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., asking to join a lawsuit that contends the rule lets coal-burning generators evade Clean Air Act requirements.\""The federal rule falls far short of the measures needed to protect human health and the environment,"" said Steven Chester, director of the state Department of Environmental Quality.\Eryn Witcher, spokeswoman for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which developed the regulation, said the Bush administration would ""vigorously defend this rule against any challenges.""\Mercury is a neurotoxin that can damage the brain and central nervous system and is particularly dangerous to children.\Coal-fired power plants are the nation's biggest source of mercury, which settles in waterways and accumulates in fish.\Mercury pollution has prompted the Michigan Department of Community Health to issue warnings about eating some types of fish from inland lakes.\Gov.

In Michigan, the plan envisions a two-thirds reduction by 2018, the DEQ says.\The federal rule establishes a cap-and-trade system under which power plants that exceed their pollution limits could buy pollution credits from other plants that emit less mercury than allowed.\Environmentalists wanted a requirement that plants use the most effective technology on the market to reduce mercury output from their smokestacks, saying that approach would slash emissions 90% within three years.\Industry leaders say such technology doesn't exist and that market-oriented strategies such as cap-and-trade are the best way to combat pollution.\""The utilities want to do the right thing and reduce mercury emissions, but the federal rule is the gold standard,"" said Dan Bishop, spokesman for Consumers Energy, which has four coal-fired plants in Michigan.\The disagreement was reflected in a report submitted by Granholm's mercury reduction task force, which had representatives from industry and environmental groups.\Chester is reviewing the report and will make recommendations to Granholm shortly, DEQ spokesman Bob McCann said.\A coalition of environmental groups applauded Granholm for joining the lawsuit and urged her to require the 90% emissions cut.\""By doing so, she would promote modern and clean technologies, create new jobs, protect our fishing and tourism industries and take a huge step forward for Michigan families who want to fish our waters without worrying about mercury,"" said Kate Madigan, spokeswoman for the Public Interest Research Group in Michigan.\DISCLAIMER: THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION MAY DIFFER SLIGHTLY FROM THE PRINTED ARTICLE"

Dingell's carbon plan serves economy best
\
Congress seems to be moving toward a law that will sharply limit carbon emissions. Given that that's the case, such legislation should be balanced to have minimal impact on economic growth and job creation.
\
That's one of the reasons we are hoping Rep. John Dingell, D-Dearborn, prevails in fending off a challenge from California Rep. Henry Waxman, who hopes to unseat him as chairman of the House Commerce and Energy Committee.
\
Dingell has placed on the table a reasonable carbon cap-and-trade proposal that would employ market strategies for reducing greenhouse gases.
\
His legislation would cover roughly 88 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, bringing them to 6 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and 80 percent below those levels by 2050.
\
The bill would create a market for carbon credits. Limits would be placed on the amount of carbon a business could emit, and those that kept emissions below the limit could either sell their credits to others on the open market or bank them for the future.
\
Dingell's plan places the country on a steady path toward bringing carbon emissions under control, and makes the likely bet that between now and 2050 new technologies will emerge that will accelerate the ability to capture carbon from tailpipes and smokestacks.
\
Waxman, by contrast, proposes a far more aggressive timetable and stricter limits. He signed on to legislation that would ban any new coal-fired power plants built without a carbon capture system, an unrealistic measure that would send energy hungry industries fleeing overseas.
\
The Californian would also come down far harder on the automobile industry. He supports imposing California's proposed tailpipe standards on automakers, adding an extra $65 billion to the industry's research and development tab.
\
Critics of Dingell, including powerful environmental groups, accuse him of being overly interested in protecting auto jobs.
\
But Dingell has considerable experience balancing economic growth against environmental protection. He crafted the Clean Air and Clean Water acts to do just that.
\
America is headed into a severe economic downturn. Unemployment hit a 17-year high last week. This is not a time to be strangling industry with overly burdensome environmental regulation.
\
Dingell has proposed reasonable action against carbon emissions. Some jobs will surely be lost if it is enacted. But not nearly as many as if Waxman gets his way.
\
It's more than just hometown loyalty that causes us to root for Dingell in this fight.
\
The veteran congressman understands the need for both a clean environment and a healthy economy.
\
Attacking the climate change problem with a steady, rational plan is far better than adopting panicky legislation that reduces carbon emissions by destroying jobs.
\
Dingell's carbon plan
\
*Relies on a cap-and-trade system covering 88 percent of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions.
\
*Sets a goal of reducing greenhouse gases 6 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, 44 percent in 2030 and 80 percent by 2050.
\
*Phases in requirements for utilities in 2012, large industrial plants in 2014 and residential and commercial distribution companies for natural gas in 2017.
\
*Increases building code efficiency 30 percent by 2010 and 50 percent by 2020.
\
*Allows companies to meet some compliance targets by offsets, as well as banking or borrowing credits.

41,"MACKINAC ISLAND -- It was a non-debate debate that kicked off the 34th annual Mackinac Policy Conference on Wednesday when U.S. Senate candidates Congressman Gary Peters, D-Bloomfield Township, and former Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land, R-Byron Center, tried to sell themselves to more than 100 people.\The candidates were not on the stage at the same time, instead, separately making their pitches and taking questions from the audience. They didn't do the traditional handshake before the audience. And they didn't pose for photos together.\But they both tailored their messages to the business-friendly audience at the event sponsored by the Detroit Regional Chamber.\Both said they support getting the federal government to pay for and build a customs plaza at the proposed New International Trade Crossing bridge between Windsor and Detroit across the Detroit River.\Both said there needs to be federal support for small-business investment, but they diverged when they talked about how that federal support should happen.\Peters talked about legislation he sponsored to get more financing options for small business, ""the heart and soul of the economy.""\Land said less federal government interference and regulation was the way to achieve a more thriving economy.\""Government overreach is hurting Michigan business,"" she said. ""The American Dream that my grandparents had is now in jeopardy.""\They differed on a number of issues and made sure the audience knew it.\""My opponent wouldn't have supported the auto bailout,"" Peters said of Land's stance on federal funding for General Motors and Chrysler.\Land noted: ""I've always supported auto workers. ... It's great that the autos are doing well. I want to go to Washington, D.C., and make sure we have a competitive environment and that they don't over-regulate and overtax.""\Land hit Peters on his vote for cap and trade on energy policy, saying he was standing with ""a billionaire radical from California, who wants cap and trade and a carbon tax,"" referring to Tom Steyer, a liberal hedge fund manager who plans on putting $100 million into influencing policies on climate change.\Peters said he wants to incentivize new technology and alternatives, such as solar and geothermal power, to deal with carbon emissions.\When it came to personal stories, both had moments to share.\Peters talked about spending his 20th anniversary Wednesday with his wife, Colleen, at the conference.\Land talked about her grandparents, immigrating from the Netherlands and starting up a hotel and trailer park. She didn't, however, talk about her husband Dan Hibma's business taking over the park, getting the residents to move out and tearing down the business to make way for redevelopment, which hasn't happened yet.\Both Land and Peters have aired ads about the trailer park and hotel.\They both also have aired ads trying to sway women to their side. Land said: ""I have always supported women, I support equal pay for equal work, always have.""\When asked about her stance on issues of importance to women, Land said she was a strong supporter of women when she was Secretary of State, and boasted of having more women managers working in the department than before she took office.\According to an exclusive poll of 600 likely Michigan voters done for the Free Press, WXYZ-TV (Channel 7) and our statewide media polling partners by EPIC-MRA of Lansing on May 17-20, Peters held a 44%-38% lead over Land with 18% undecided. And the overall margin is largely attributable to a 14-percentage-point advantage Peters had among women.\It was the first semi-joint appearance for the candidates, who both have been in the race for more than a year. Both said their experience with business -- Peters as a financial adviser before he began serving in public office and Land streamlining the work done at the SOS -- would make them a better senator to replace the retiring Carl Levin.\Contact Kathleen Gray: 517-372-8661 or kgray99@freepress.com"
42,"WASHINGTON - The Bush administration Thursday finalized a regulation for the eastern United States, including Michigan, that would cut power plant pollutants that cause smog, acid rain and soot by about two-thirds over the next decade.\The rule - which will cost about $3.6 billion a year to implement but is expected to save $85 billion in annual health benefits -""will result in the biggest health benefit of any EPA rule in more than a decade,"" said Jeffrey Holmstead, the Environmental Protection Agency's assistant administrator.\Consumers who get electricity from the plants can expect their monthly power bills to increase eventually by up to $1 to pay for the changes.\The EPA predicts that the rule will prevent 17,000 heart and respiratory deaths caused by pollution from coal-fired power plants. It's aimed at reducing nitrogen oxide, which causes smog, and sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain and soot.\The new rule is part of a two-pronged effort to fulfill President George W. Bush's pledge to clean up pollution from power plants that were built before the nation's air pollution laws were enacted. A more controversial rule to reduce mercury - one criticized by environmental activists as being too slow and weak - is to be finalized next week.\Because the regulation is designed to reduce pollution that travels across state lines, it applies only to 28 Eastern and Midwestern states and the District of Columbia.\Unlike most past regulatory efforts, this rule doesn't tell power plants how to reduce pollution. Instead it puts caps on emissions and lets the utilities decide how to get below those limits.\The key to the rule is that utilities are given a free-market tool that allows them to trade the right-to-pollute among power plants much like pork belly futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange - a method that helped cut acid rain in the 1990s. A utility that can't reduce its emissions can buy the right-to-pollute from a utility that exceeded cleanup requirements.\This is how the new system works: The EPA will allocate allotments for the right-to-pollute by state based on how much power each produces. The states will then divvy those up among power plants, but the number of allotments will be less than what's allowed for current pollution, so utilities will have to clean up or buy another utility's allotments.\Thursday's rule drew measured praise from industry and environmental groups. But environmental groups and state and local air regulators also said it doesn't do enough quickly enough and will still leave some Northeastern cities with dirty air even after the toughest rules go into effect.\Angela Ledford, the director of the environmental group Clear the Air, said the new rule gives power plants more time to clean up than existing law allowed.\Bill Becker, the executive director of an association for state and local air regulators, called the rule ""a good first step, but the deadlines are too long, the emissions caps are too weak.""\Ed Krenik, a lobbyist for coal power plants, called the rule ""a good step forward by utilizing cap-and-trade.""\But Krenik and Edison Electric Institute, an industry lobbying group, said the regulation isn't really what they wanted. They wanted Bush's more controversial rewrite of the Clean Air Act, which the Senate killed Wednesday.\The president's more comprehensive proposal - killed by a tie vote in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee - had the shrinking emission limits and cap-and-trade.\But it also would have eliminated several key aspects of the Clean Air Act that utilities said were duplicative. Environmental groups argued the aspects were crucial tools to reduce pollution. The proposal also would have applied to the entire country.\Associated Press contributed to this report.\MEMO: SEE ALSO STATE EDITION, PAGE 1C\DISCLAIMER: THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION MAY DIFFER SLIGHTLY FROM THE PRINTED ARTICLE"

After Katrina, New Orleans is going green
\
By Cain Burdeau
\
Associated Press
\
NEW ORLEANS -- The city known more for French Quarter trash than recycling or renewable energy is going green. In rebuilding since Hurricane Katrina, homes are being fitted with solar panels, organic farming is catching on and the city's got a new fleet of hybrid buses.
\
On the flanks of those buses, a catch phrase -- Cleaner, Smarter -- could be the anthem for the movement by institutions and individuals to slowly turn the city's environmentally-unfriendly image around.
\
Maybe the filthy water that flooded 80 percent of the city after the catastrophe in August 2005 made residents rethink the way to rebuild. Or maybe it's the tax credits or energy price spikes. Whatever the reason, the hurricane created a testing ground for ideas and initiatives.
\
Before Katrina, government officials rarely talked about renewable energy or ""green building."" Solar technology powered little more than parking meters. Environmentalists were shut out of Louisiana politics for decades.
\
Now, they see a watershed era taking shape.
\
For example, in the Lower 9th Ward, hit particularly hard by Katrina, some 20 energy-saving homes are using solar panels.
\
""I never knew nothing about solar panels until after the storm,"" said Mable Howard, an 80-year-old doll maker whose five-room home was flooded. The solar panels were donated and installed for free, and her electric bill has been cut at least in half during some months.
\
There is also renewed focus on restoring habitats that protected New Orleans from storm surge before the destruction of wetlands by the oil industry, timber companies and levee construction. Near the Lower 9th, for example, there are plans to plant hundreds of bald cypress in a bayou to help restore wetlands.
\
Urban organic farming also has gained momentum, new bicycle lanes are being planned and even the French Quarter is spiffier, thanks to an aggressive cleaning effort.
\
The greening could gain greater footing under President Barack Obama, who recently named Lower 9th Ward native Linda Jackson to head the Environmental Protection Agency.
\
Still, a distaste for environmentalism is reflected in the Louisiana congressional delegation. Even most Democrats are perennial bottom-feeders on a measure of pro-environment voting in Congress by the League of Conservation Voters.
\
""It takes a very brave person to get your head above the wall here,"" said Oliver Houck, a Tulane University law professor and environmental advocate.
\
For decades, Louisiana's state budget has been dependent on oil revenue. But some policymakers and investors say a more open attitude could have a big payoff. The state, they say, is rich in water, wind and sunshine -- just the stuff for emerging cap-and-trade energy markets, which are aimed at reducing carbon emissions.
\
Under a cap-and-trade program, utilities that exceed the cap for emissions must either make pollution reductions or buy additional allowances. Those who cut emissions below the cap would be able to sell allowances.
\
""Louisiana could be a very large source for carbon credits,"" said Jon Guidroz, director of project development for Free Flow Power Corp. The Massachusetts company is in talks with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission about harnessing power from the Ohio and Mississippi rivers with turbines.
\
Last year, the New Orleans City Council approved an energy-efficiency program to improve 2,800 properties a year by installing insulation, weather stripping and compact fluorescent light bulbs. The new 39 hybrid buses -- operating on a blend of biodiesel, gasoline and electric power -- were obtained with a $15 million federal grant.
\
In 2007, New Orleans became one of about two dozen cities nationwide to be named a ""Solar American City"" by the U.S. Energy Department, which gave the city a $450,000 grant to establish solar programs.
\
And there's an opportunity to train builders, too. A 2,-000-square-foot BuildSmart Learning Center that includes a replica of an energy-efficient home, offers free workshops to teach ""green building."" The center also has a showroom of gadgets like dual-flush toilets and low-flow shower-heads.
\
New state and federal tax credits are driving a niche solar technology market.
\
""We're up to 15 employees now,"" said C. Tucker Crawford, a salesman at South Coast Solar, a company that had three employees a year ago.
\
The business installs solar thermal, solar pool heating and solar panels in New Orleans. Crawford credits the boom in business to tax breaks, which allow a homeowner to spend as little as $5,000 for about $25,000 worth of solar technology.
\
""We're a little behind the curve,"" said city energy manager John McGowin, whose office was set up after Katrina with a Clinton Foundation grant to promote solar and hydropower use. ""But we're catching up.""

With a slap to the face of all taxpayers who support Lansing Community College, the LCC board has taken a ""political"" stand against the aviation center moving to its controversial new home at Mason Jewett Airport. The contractual agreement to move from the AVTECH center at Port Lansing airport was signed by the college president due to the enhanced facilities available in Mason, but the board decided since it hadn't given the ""OK,"" the move was stalemated. This comes after the threat to condemn the existing building by the airport manager.
\
Amid all this feuding, the fact was uncovered that a purchaser would have been willing to buy the facility at Mason Jewett and give the building to the college because of his love for aviation.
\
What happened to putting students first? There are some disturbing ego problems at this college that need to be addressed immediately. This is not about meetings and political posturing, it's about educating people when Michigan needs jobs.

Cautious on energy
\
Congressman Paul Tonko of New York led a rousing discussion of our need to enliven efforts to achieve ""environmentally friendly outcomes"" on our planet.
\
Yes, we need clean air, clean water and low impact energy. Why don't we broadly use solar, wind, nuclear, clean coal and batteries?
\
Were they cost effective? Did they pose negatives that environmentalists oppose? Why haven't entrepreneurs leaped at the opportunities?
\
Why did California recently buy ""passive power"" from Australia made with Chinese parts and U.S. government funds?
\
President Obama says the answer is ""cap and trade."" Some say our energy will be cheaper; most say it will rise. Today on C-SPAN, Democratic congressmen said green energy efforts will create 700,00 jobs or more.
\
Cap-and-trade forces citizens to use expensive, unproven alternative energy by raising energy prices. It is hard to believe that knowledgeable people think batteries will be better for the environment and the pocketbook. There are too many unanswered questions.

Health reform a fiasco
\
I would like to respond to Christopher E. Smith's April 12 Viewpoint, ""Some health tips for LSJ"":
\
I have heard that the new U.S. health-care plan is very similar to the one Mitt Romney signed into law a few years ago in Massachusetts.
\
What neither party will admit to is that it isn't working.
\
The Democrats don't mention it because the costs are skyrocketing, and it is going broke. The Republicans don't mention it because Mitt Romney was dumb enough to sign it into law.
\
The penalty for not having insurance under our new law would be hundreds of dollars per year. The cost of the health insurance is much more than that.
\
Pre-existing condition clauses are also eliminated under our new law.
\
People will purchase insurance only after they become ill, and that will bankrupt all health insurance companies.
\
How many Michiganders will die needlessly when the federal government rations health care?

I am 82 years old. I was born in India, and have spent the last 20 years in the United States. I received a college degree in British India and my three sons have master's degrees from U.S. schools. Children studying in this country are at a disadvantage because of the low standards of schooling, in comparison to other countries. However, some steps can improve these standards:
\
* Fewer holidays and vacations in schools. In India, we had school six days a week. We had 30 days for summer break, two days for Christmas and 15 other holidays, for a total of 266 school days - in comparison to 180 in Michigan.
\
* More dedication by students, teachers and parents; also more discipline and respect for teachers.
\
* Better acknowledgment of academic achievements at par with those of sports and arts.
\
* Gradual advancement of curriculum in middle and high schools. A high school graduate should be able to fit in easily in college.

LCC needs counselors
\
I commend Sally Madison (Letters, July 11) for alerting the community to the dangerous situation under way at Lansing Community College.
\
I was stunned to learn President Brent Knight considers student counselors ""an unnecessary luxury.""
\
One wonders if Knight is willing to be fully accountable for his decision to dismiss all three counselors.
\
If a student suicide note shows that an individual had given up because there was no one to talk to about a problem, would Knight accept responsibility for the tragedy?
\
As an adjunct professor in the Science Department at LCC for two years, I had an opportunity to get to know some of the students I taught and the concerns they had. I learned of the needs for a counselor by listening to their issues. I was impressed by the dedication of the faculty in my department and the motivation of some of my students.

LCC is a great learning environment. It is shockingly shortsighted to diminish the support structure that some students may need for their growth.

Can someone please tell me why the press does not inform people about the ""American Clean Energy and Security Act - also known as ""Cap-and-Trade"" Bill (H.R. 2454)?

It is more than 1,000 pages of extra ideas, along with a 300-page amendment for taxes to be paid by everyone, not just the rich.

Estimates for the increased costs vary from $175 per family to several thousand dollars per family.
\
One example: When you need to sell your home, environmentalists come in and make sure that your home is environmentally safe - i.e. up-to-date appliances, windows, furnace, etc. that must meet environmental standards mandated by the government.
\
Also, fossil fuels will be taxed. Therefore, if you use gasoline, natural gas, oil, electricity and coal, the companies that supply these fossils fuels to you will be taxed and than guess what?

Urban-rural split seen

In reviewing the debate over funding for the Ingham County sheriff's road patrol, there is one obvious fact:
\
The majority of the Ingham County commissioners could care less.
\
Their voters are not affected because they live in basic metro areas with local police forces.
\
Why should they worry about the rural areas when it doesn't affect their voting base? What concern do they have if the rural areas are unable to afford to pay extra for law enforcement coverage? Why do they care if there is an increase in crime in the rural areas?
\
What do they care that the rural areas pay a higher percentage per use of the jail, juvenile facilities, and other programs than the metro areas as long as their voter base is covered? Fifty-five percent of the jail population comes from one city, but they provide less than 55 percent of the budget.
\
The only commissioners who seem to care are Randy Schafer, Steve Dougan, Laura Davis and Don Vickers because they represent the rural areas.

46,"President Barack Obama and Congress have shown some real leadership and should be applauded for helping get the American Clean Energy and Security Act through the House.\While some may be uneasy about doing something about climate change, the time for arguing and delaying has to come to an end.

Doing nothing or ignoring the problem will cost us dearly.\Vanita Mistry\Detroit\More fear than sense\The Democratic energy policy initiative exploits the populist fear of catastrophic climate change to fund an expanded social agenda, led by health care reform.

The last thing the national economy needs is a trade war. Yet that is a possibility created by language in the House's climate bill, and now being sought in Senate legislation by a several senators, including Michigan's Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow.
\
Congress is working on legislation to limit carbon emissions to protect the environment. The U.S. House has produced a cap-and-trade bill that creates new limits on emissions and sets up an elaborate regime of emissions permits that emitters can ultimately buy and sell among themselves. The Senate is working on its own version, and 10 senators from industrial states, including Democrats Levin and Stabenow, are demanding that the Senate bill contain tariffs on products imported from other nations that do not impose similar regulations on themselves. The letter specifically mentioned steel manufactured in China.
\
The senators said they were worried the legislation may create hardships on U.S. manufacturing and that a ""level playing field"" should be imposed on nations without climate regulations -- which should give the senators pause about the wisdom of any such legislation.
\
Nevertheless, the 10 sent a letter to President Barack Obama asking that he address the trade issue. When the House included a provision that countries that do not have global warming regulations must purchase emissions permits to export to the U.S. market, the president said he worried about ""sending protectionist signals.""
\
The president needs to hold firm.
\
While the support of the 10 senators is seen as important to passage of a Senate climate bill, a new round of trade protectionism, whether or not it takes place in the name of helping the environment, could hurt the nation's economic recovery. The U.S. Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930 is seen as adding to the damage suffered by the developed world's economies as they spiraled into the Great Depression.
\
Hillsdale College economics Professor Gary Wolfram asks why it would be useful for the U.S. economy to either increase the cost of imports from nations such as China and India or cause them to retaliate on U.S. exports. ""They could be huge markets for U.S. cars,"" he notes.
\
A tariff on imported goods would have the same effect on the economy as another tax -- but it couldn't be as carefully targeted as a tax.
\
While the U.S. has a significant trade deficit with China, that is because we have a $14 trillion economy and it has a $2.6 trillion economy. U.S. exports to China last year amounted to $71 billion, up nearly 550 percent from 1999. China is this nation's third-largest trading partner, after Canada and Mexico. Michigan last year exported more than a billion dollars worth of goods to China.
\
China has been criticized for manipulating its currency to aid its exports and failing to honor intellectual property rights such as copyright in products it has imported from the West. These should be dealt with in trade negotiations.
\
But we should not hurt ourselves with new tariffs.

"
48,"WASHINGTON - Landmark legislation to reduce global warming is set to spark an intense Senate debate in early June.\Although it is unlikely to become law this year, the Climate Security Act is seen by both supporters and opponents as evidence of how far Congress has moved on the issue and how quickly a bill is likely to pass after a new president moves into the White House in January and a new Congress takes office.\""I really believe that if we don't get across the finish line this year, we will next year,"" said Jeremy Symons, executive director of the global warming campaign at the National Wildlife Federation. ""This is the first bill to have a serious chance of getting passed.""\The bill, by Sens. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and John Warner, R-Va., is the first major global warming legislation to be approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. It would reduce global warming emissions by more than 65% by 2050 in an effort to slow devastating climate change that could cause massive flooding along U.S. coasts, increase the number and strength of hurricanes in the gulf states, create drought throughout the Midwest farm states and fuel more wildfires in the West.\The legislation seeks to give power plants, factories and refineries a financial incentive to reduce their global warming emissions. The bill would create a cap and trade program that limits total U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide and gives credits to companies able to cut their emissions through increased energy efficiency or cleaner technology. Companies can then sell those credits to other businesses that have not yet met those goals.\Over the next four decades, all the affected industries would gradually have to make deep reductions in their emissions.\Supporters say the bill is crucial to save the U.S. economy and environment from the disastrous effects of climate change. It has won praise from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and the Democratic presidential contenders, Sens. Barack Obama of Illinois and Hillary Clinton of New York.\Opponents, led by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., say the bill would drive energy costs higher than they are now and crush an already weak economy. They have threatened to mount a filibuster to block a Senate vote and are confident the bill's sponsors don't have the 60 votes needed to end the debate.\The bill also has not made much progress in the House. And President George W. Bush, an opponent, is not likely to sign it into law if it passes the full Congress. Still, opponents worry about increasing bipartisan support for the legislation.\Environmentalists say momentum is on their side as global warming hits home with more and more Americans.\Just this week, the Interior Department announced it was putting the polar bear on the list of threatened species because global warming is melting the creature's icy arctic habitat. It was the first time an animal has been put on the list of threatened or endangered species based on habitat destruction caused by climate change.\( sidebar: WEIGH IN WITH MICHIGAN'S SENATORS )\Sen.

Just as an ice skater with his or her arms extended slows down, a bulgier Earth spins slower.\Not that you'd notice it.

If the ice sheets in Greenland and west Antarctica melt, the sea level could rise by 33 to 39 feet - something that could take anywhere from several decades to several centuries to happen.\That would cause a slowdown in the Earth's rotation of about one-thirtieth of a second a day, or about 1 second a month, 12 seconds a year, or about 2 minutes every decade.\-- Associated Press\ILLUSTRATION: Photo\CAPTION: The polar bear has become a poster creature in the effort to reverse the decline of sea ice in the Arctic.\CAPTIONWRITER: JOSEPH NAPAAQTUQ SAGE / Associated Press\MEMO: SIDEBAR ATTACHED.\DISCLAIMER: THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION MAY DIFFER SLIGHTLY FROM THE PRINTED ARTICLE"

Environmentalists should back Dingell
\
Veteran committee chair has edge on challenger Waxman on climate change
\
By Lana Pollack
\
U.S. Rep. John Dingell, longtime powerful chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is being challenged for committee leadership by California Congressman Henry Waxman, the committee's No. 2 man. Such a frontal attack on a member of one's own party is rare, especially against a master of pathbreaking, progress-making political compromise like Dingell. These are the skills now needed more than ever if a new administration and Congress are to deliver on critical challenges for the nation's economy and environment.
\
As a Michigan environmentalist trying to persuade citizens to pay attention to politics, I've long claimed that what happens in Washington soon washes up on the shores of our Great Lakes. Committee chair decisions affect our economic lives, the quality of our environment, the costs of our health care, and virtually every other important issue this country faces.
\
In the matter of Dingell vs. Waxman, we're looking at two highly accomplished senior Democrats, both longtime recognized champions of environmental protection and health care reform -- preeminent issues that fall within the committee's jurisdiction. They differ in their political bases -- Michigan vs. California -- so it's sometimes easy to confuse what they can say with what they can actually do.
\
Dingell has an unmatched environmental record. In addition to the National Environmental Policy Act, he can claim substantial if not primary credit for the Clean Air Act and its amendments, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, Superfund Act, the National Wilderness Act, the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge Act and one of the most important protections of all time -- the Endangered Species Act.
\
It's much easier to talk green from a California base -- and, surely, the nation should be grateful to the Golden State for its environmental leadership. Waxman is a clear leader in this regard, but it costs him little to show contempt for the auto industry that is a big part of Dingell's political base.
\
Like most of the rest of Michigan's congressional delegation, Dingell's environmental record is undeniably blemished by too many years of reflexive loyalty to a stubbornly backward-looking auto industry. However recently -- before the last Congress -- Dingell demonstrated his impatience and a shift in attitude by publicly admonishing the industry to change its stance on climate policy.
\
Dingell and Waxman exist in a relationship rubbed raw by their disparate views on the auto industry and a collision in ambition to hold the one of the country's most powerful gavels. While ego is adding some fuel to the fire, at bottom Waxman's challenge is an attempt to force more progressive legislation through Congress on climate change and energy issues.
\
However, this battle goes way beyond the auto industry, and success demands a chair who can get a comprehensive bill to the president's desk within the next two years.
\
Success will require much more than Congress forcing radical reforms on a failing auto industry. After all, with the fuel economy reforms passed this past year, this is the only major industry now significantly carbon constrained even as it faces a financial crisis threatening the survival of its heartland firms, which directly and indirectly employ millions.
\
Success on climate change and energy legislation will require staring down other politically powerful forces, particularly the oil and coal industries as well as electric power, development, road-building and other sectors, while protecting ordinary consumers.
\
So where do I, a passionate environmentalist with a deep loyalty to Michigan, come down on this fight? I see no need to displace Dingell, who has made clear his commitment to moving an economy-wide cap and trade bill and spurring development of new and efficient technologies to force down greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Dingell has held in-depth hearings on the issue and is the first major House committee chair with detailed draft legislation laying out the path to revolutionary climate change reform. Although his initial proposal must be strengthened, particularly as its near-term goal targets only 6 percent reductions in greenhouse gas by 2020, I'm impressed by the intelligent, comprehensive and ultimately revolutionary approach Dingell advances.
\
Success with effective, comprehensive climate change legislation requires the best, most savvy legislative leader we have, which time and again John Dingell has proven himself to be.

50,"
The letter by Dan Dowsett (June 18) cynically congratulates the city of Lansing on its collections of ""weeds"" growing along Michigan Avenue. After re-reading this letter several times, I realized that Dowsett - and perhaps others - do not realize that not all flowering plants are familiar annuals like petunias or pansies.
\
The plants growing in the streetside, fenced rain gardens are perennial plants native to this region. They are hardy, drought- and winter-tolerant and create a beautiful display when in flower during the summer months. These native plants are intended to help slow the flow of rapid rainwater runoff to the Grand River, forestalling pollution and devastating erosion of the river downstream.
\
Ingham County Drain Commissioner Pat Lindemann is to be commended for this forward-thinking project, providing clean water for the entire community. Anyone interested in learning, rather than reacting, can volunteer to help maintain the rain gardens, or learn more about native plant gardening through organizations like Wild Ones, www.for-wild.org.

LSJ panelist is waste
\
As a long-time reader of this paper, I honestly don't understand why the LSJ waste its ink on asking James Jackson his always negative opinions on any topic.
\
The June 20 question for the LSJ Community Panel was ""What are your thoughts on the Gulf oil disaster?""
\
Jackson begins with ramblings about the media, incompetent mayors, governors and unused buses.
\
Huh?
\
No, not Katrina, Mr. Jackson. The Gulf oil disaster!
\
He then goes on to blame President Obama and then to his real agenda of opposition to cap and trade and how our economy ""Will be destroyed."" What? Our economy is good now? Wow, off track again! Plus, the oil spill will do that.
\
There were nine panelists' responses published last week and Jackson was the only one not able to express outrage, sadness or concern about the Gulf, its environment or its people. I think when asked what his thoughts were about the Gulf oil disaster, Jackson should have just replied, ""I haven't any.""
\
Save ink.

So much for 'conservatives'
\
I certainly agree with Sheri Willis when she said (Letters, June 21) ""The people you send to Washington have a life-changing impact on every aspect of your life."" However, if you follow her suggestion to vote for ""constitutional conservatives"" you will get more rulings like the recent Supreme Court's decision that says a corporation (an artificial person according to the Supreme Court in 1819) has the same rights as does an ""natural person.""
\
This ruling will allow corporations to buy elections in the future even more than they have done in the past because it overturned laws that prevented corporations from using their profits to buy political campaign and issue ads. Remember, this was a ""conservative"" majority vote on the court. So much for conservative judges not being ""activist,"" and for voting for ""constitutional conservatives"" to protect your rights.

In your June 21 article on the disparity in wages between new and veteran UAW auto workers, you suggest that competitors such as Toyota raised their wages to compete with domestic car companies.
\
I don't think that is correct. The reason they pay nearly as much as the U.S. automakers is to persuade employees not to bring in the UAW.
\
That is an important distinction. To be competitive, wages in non-union plants have only to match the going rate for manufacturing jobs in the region, which in Kentucky is about half the wage Toyota pays.
\
What this means is that the UAW not only forces car buyers to pay extra for cars made by the companies formerly known as the Big Three, but for cars built in the U.S. by foreign manufacturers, as well.
\
And when we pay more, we buy less, which means fewer jobs.

Can't we all be 'clean'?
\
I am deeply concerned about Deb Shaughnessy's refusal to sign the Eaton County clean campaign pledge. I have to ask why any reputable candidate would refuse to participate in a clean campaign? Perhaps Shaughnessy is planning to run a dishonest smear campaign against her Republican competitors.
\
I should point out that no Democratic candidate refused to sign the pledge. The contrast could not be clearer. Democrats in Eaton County are going to run a clean campaign in the primary for the seat being left by Rep. Rick Jones.
\
Republicans can look forward to a smearfest from the campaign of Shaughnessy. Voters deserve better.

They aren't whining
\
A recent front-page story in the LSJ bemoaned the fact that newly hired United Auto Workers make less than what an average manufacturing worker makes.
\
Complete with a graph, the article compares new hire General Motors wages to all manufacturing jobs. They forget to mention the new workers get substantial raises in the first few years that bring them close to the top wages. The UAW members are still among the best paid manufacturing workers in the country.
\
The article claimed that many of the newly hired were upset that they where working with so many others that where making much more than they were for the same job. Most I have spoken to are grateful for the job they have because for every one of them there are probably 10 people willing and eager to take their spot.
\
Lansing auto workers build some of the world's best cars and should be very proud of their work. This article makes them sound like a bunch of whiners - and I know better. Please buy American.

Excerpts of a Detroit News editorial board phone interview with GOP presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee:
\
Iowa victory
\
Q. You scored a big victory in Iowa. To what do you account for this surge?
\
A. I think I'm speaking to issues that touch ordinary American families, and they're looking for somebody who not only can carry a message to them but for them. So many of the messages seem to be consultant-driven and contrived. I think there is a real yearning for authenticity as well as somebody who approaches politics from the standpoint of bringing practical solutions to problems. There has been a clear, almost stunning revelation that in this election cycle message is more important than money.
\
Populism
\
Q. Would you consider yourself a populist?
\
A. I get called that almost every day. I like to consider myself an American who understands the struggles of working-class people and believes that government's policies ought to help everybody, including those folks who frankly are a very important part of the Republican Party, but I think in many cases who felt left out, ignored or not fully understood.
\
Taxes
\
Q. An interesting part of your platform is the Fair Tax plan. You would replace the federal income tax with a national sales tax of 23 percent. Explain how that would work.
\
A. What the Fair Tax does is it starts out with an elimination of penalizing people for their productivity, whether that productivity comes in the form of corporate income, individual income, money earned on dividends, savings, investments, capital gains or inheritance. Up until then, I thought it would be a regressive tax system, especially on the poor. But the prebate provision in the Fair Tax, which essentially untaxes every person for the basic necessities of medicine and food, makes the tax a progressive tax.
\
When analyzed, the people in the bottom third of the economy actually see the greatest benefit from the implementation of the Fair Tax, although people in the other two-thirds of the economic spectrum see gains.
\
What this does is it creates a system where you get your entire paycheck. It is much simpler. It means that you no have no invisible taxes, which is one of the reasons our tax system has gotten so out of hand. The average person has no idea they're paying, on average, 33 percent in taxes.
\
Social Security
\
Q. Now you've also taken a different position than your opponents on Social Security and have said you would end Social Security and replace it with a tax break.
\
A. No. I've never said I would end Social Security. What I have said about Social Security is that I would consider giving people the option at Social Security age, if they had benefits and made arrangements for which the Social Security check on a monthly basis was not paramount to their survival, to take a one-time tax-free buyout from their Social Security -- much like a company would buy out a pension plan. What it does, it eliminates the biggest problem of Social Security, which is the monthly payout for long periods of time.
\
If you were able to get that one-time buyout that is tax-free, I think many of us would take that option thinking that we would be able to end the government's long-term obligation and at the same time give us the capacity to do something with that money, give it to our kids, invest it, anything. It would be our money.
\
Social issues
\
Q. You've rallied the social conservatives in the party with your positions on abortion and evolution. If you were to get the nomination, how do you appeal to a broader electorate?
\
A. My positions even on the social issues have never really scared the daylight out of liberals because people are certainly capable about having an honest and intellectual discussion about the worth of each person. What I am is a person who believes that life, whether it is a life that is 8 weeks in the womb, 8 years old or 80 years old living in a long-term care facility, is a life that is worth living, and it is a life that should be treated with dignity and respect.
\
It is a matter of having an honest discussion and saying let's go to our roots and realize that the only logical conclusion that we can draw from that concept of having these inalienable rights of life and the equality of man is that we cannot make some more equal than others. Once we do that we really are on very shaky ground.
\
Foreign policy experience
\
Q. What in your background and experience prepares you to deal with the international issues America faces?
\
A. I've traveled to approximately 40 countries in my lifetime. As governor, I've traveled extensively not only in trade agreements and cultural exchanges, but I've chaired the U.S. chapter of the World League for Freedom and Democracy and worked with elected officials from other countries.
\
I've been to Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Lebanon, Israel nine times, Egypt, all over Europe, Russia, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan.
\
I think Ronald Reagan was a great example of a person who came to office with the same kind of skepticism and criticism. He hadn't had foreign political experience, but he had judgment, he had clear principles that guided him. He understood that the U.S. should be the most powerful nation on Earth, but had to use that power circumspectly.
\
Iraq
\
Q. What would you be doing today in Iraq?
\
A. I believe Gen. (David) Petraeus has done a magnificent job of recognizing that the real way to win in Iraq is from the bottom up, not the top down. You create a democracy in the neighborhoods, the villages and the provinces and it ultimately flows up. Our own country understands that.
\
When we first went to Iraq, part of the flawed policy is that we thought we could create a very strong federal government and that everything would work out.
\
The continuation of that concept is the right strategy. We're seeing more Iraqis take care of more security in their cities and villages. As that continues, it gives us a great deal of hope and optimism that we will one day leave Iraq. It may never look quite like democracy does in the West.
\
But certainly they can have a level of stability and not create what would happen if we pulled out prematurely -- and that is a geopolitical vacuum into which terrorists would be able to establish very strong and unchallenged bases but also would give an extraordinary level of demoralization to our military that might take a generation to recover from.
\
Fuel economy
\
Q. President Bush recently signed an energy bill that will increase fuel economy standards 40 percent by 2020. Was that the right thing to do?
\
A. It was because until we start moving toward a greater level of energy efficiency, we'll never get to energy independence. I'm absolutely convinced that the goal of energy independence within a decade is a matter no longer of just good stewardship of the economy and the environment, but it's become increasingly an issue of energy security. Our party needs to show more leadership in the area of concern for the environment. I am one of two Republican candidates who have suggested cap and trade agreements for environmental reasons to reduce CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions.
\
Trade
\
Q. John McCain says free trade has helped created jobs. You have been more critical of Bush administration trade policies. What is your position?
\
A. I have been accused of being a protectionist. I'm not. I believe in free trade. I supported NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement). I supported CAFTA (Central America). I'm not trying to be clever, but I said that's fine. But then we need to make these nations ""have ta"" live by the same agreements that we live by and exercise strict enforcement of them.
\
Health care
\
Q. How would you propose to make health care more affordable and accessible?
\
A. Insurance should become personalized and portable to the individual. Second, the whole health benefit should be focused on health and not disease. Instead, we have a disease crisis system in the United States. That is extraordinarily expensive. I'm not wanting to be the grease police. But I know when you create incentives for people to choose healthier behaviors, in the long term that is less costly.

\
For decades, Michigan and manufacturing have been vital to American's economic prosperity.
\
But Michigan's economy isn't manufacturing jobs like it did, and employment in the state's manufacturing sector has fallen one-third in the last decade.
\
Unfortunately, Michigan's economy could slow even further if Congress presses ahead with plans to make energy more expensive.
\
That's important because a new climate change bill is expected to be introduced in the U.S. Senate soon by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joe Lieberman, Connecticut independent. Its greenhouse gas reduction targets mirror those mandated in bills considered last year.
\
Cap-and-trade legislation would require sharp reductions in greenhouse gases and mandate high levels of energy efficiency and renewable energy.
\
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a 1,500-page climate change bill by seven votes in June 2009. The U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee passed a similar bill in November that had tighter near-term emission reduction targets than the House bill.
\
The bills would require cuts in greenhouse gases beginning in 2012. The emission targets would require a reduction of as much as 20 percent below 2005 levels in 2020 and an 83 percent reduction by 2050.
\
Multiple analyses show these bills would increase the price of electricity, gasoline and natural gas.
\
As a consequence, the growth rate of economic productivity, employment and household income would slow.
\
According to a study from the nonpartisan American Council for Capital Formation, overall manufacturing output would decline 5.4 percent in a low-cost case and 6 percent in a high-cost case in 2030.
\
Also, transportation manufacturing would decline up to 9 percent by 2030. Meanwhile, gross state product would decline by $12 billion to $16.5 billion by 2030.
\
These numbers can be difficult to grasp, so consider the real-world impact: Reductions in the state's economic output will reduce state budget receipts and force policymakers to make hard choices on schools, hospitals, prisons, social services, transportation and more.
\
Even worse, Michigan would see a reduction in job growth; there would be 66,700 to 90,800 fewer jobs in 2030.
\
Disposable income would fall by an average of $883 to $1,435 in 2030. Low-income families and the elderly would spend a higher proportion of their income on energy. Michigan's electricity prices for a typical household could be 60 percent higher in 2030.
\
Here's the sobering news: For all of the economic pain, there will be virtually no environmental gain.
\
Government agencies advising the president have already acknowledged that an America-only emissions cap will not make meaningful global reductions in greenhouse gas concentrations.
\
The bottom line: The federal government can certainly manufacture higher energy prices, but Michigan's manufacturing base would pay a steep price.

Having doubled the federal budget deficit in just six months in office, the Obama administration now says that the expanding deficit threatens the nation's fragile economic recovery and will require sacrifice to contain.
\
Sacrifice in the form of middle-class tax hikes, according to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Chief Economic Adviser Larry Summers.
\
Voters who swallowed candidate Barack Obama's oft-repeated pledge not to increase taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year may be surprised to hear this warning. But they shouldn't be.
\
Politicians are notorious for breaking no-new-taxes pledges. Had they only done the math, voters would have realized that Obama couldn't deliver on his sweeping expansion of government by cutting out waste and soaking the rich, as he promised. The president gave up early trying to find big money from trimming government fat, coming up with less than a half-percent of savings in his first budget. And there's only so much he can squeeze out of the wealthy.
\
The middle class is where the money is, and that's where the administration will have to go to get the cash to fund its programs.
\
This would be a good time for those middle-income earners to think about how much they're willing to pay for Obama's ambitions. Congress is on summer vacation, and most members are back in their districts, presumably listening to constituents.
\
They should be getting an earful from the taxpayers who will be saddled with the $1 trillion to $2 trillion 10-year cost of the administration's health care plan.
\
With Summers and Geithner already talking about broad tax hikes to cover the deficits the administration has posted so far, voters may want to seriously weigh how much more government they can afford.
\
Likewise with the carbon cap-and-trade proposal that has already passed the House. It will cost the average household an estimated $3,000 annually in the form of higher prices for goods and services.
\
Everyone wants a cleaner environment and everyone wants health care reform. But how much of each taxpayers are able to pay for should be a major consideration as these policies are shaped.
\
This isn't the end of what Obama has on his wish list. He also envisions expanding social spending on everything from college tuition to housing, and can be expected to drive up the deficit further with additional economic stimulus outlays.
\
It's good that Geithner and Summers have finally dropped the fantasy that the wealthy will pick up the tab for these vast new programs and everyone else will enjoy a free ride. It's not going to happen that way.
\
Taxpayers should make sure Congress understands their tolerance level for higher tax bills before it resumes debate this fall on massive new spending programs.
\
And the next time they come across a political candidate who promises them they can have a bright, new world that someone else will pay for, they should be a lot less gullible.

\
Washington -- Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm is joining the nonpartisan Pew Charitable Trusts as a senior adviser on energy and will tour the United States to tout pragmatic solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
\
Granholm is joining former Virginia Sen. John Warner in the effort to push ""for clean energy policies that have bipartisan support.""
\
""I'm not going to talk about cap and trade. I'm not going to talk about global warming,"" Granholm told a standing-room crowd Wednesday, saying she will focus on green jobs.
\
She noted the state has shed 850,000 jobs as the manufacturing and auto sectors have retrenched dramatically. ""This is the mother of all opportunities.""
\
The group said Granholm is the perfect voice to tout clean energy.
\
""Gov. Granholm has a demonstrated track record in growing the clean energy economy in the U.S.,"" said Joshua Reichert, managing director of the Pew Environment Group.
\
""During her eight years as governor of Michigan, she pioneered some of the most compelling clean energy policies in the nation, working with business and labor, Republicans and Democrats to create new economic opportunities for the state. Her leadership attracted more than 89,000 jobs and $9.4 billion in clean energy investments to Michigan.""
\
Granholm quoted the late Detroit Tigers announcer Ernie Harwell's iconic line about a batter as a ""house by the side of the road."" Instead she said the U.S. must ""swing.""
\
Warner said combating climate change is too important to ignore.
\
""The consequences of climate change are too great to not move ahead with a national policy,"" Warner said. ""This country desperately needs a new energy policy.""
\
Energy Secretary Steven Chu said it ""keeps me awake at night"" that other countries are moving ahead of the U.S. in clean energy.
\
""We need to diversify our transportation energy sources,"" Chu said.
\
""It means electrification of vehicles.""
\
By the end of 2020 or 2030, Chu predicts wind and solar power will be cost competitive with other power without subsidies. ""Boy, we can't lose that market,"" Chu said. ""We need a policy to unleash that.""
\
Chu said the Energy Department was ""closer"" to finalizing retooling loans for Chrysler Group LLC, but declined to discuss the status of talks.
\
In January, Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne said he hoped to receive about $3 billion in low-cost government loans by March 31.
\
One big hurdle has been what collateral the Energy Department will demand in exchange for the loans.
\
Granholm will speak at the Clinton Center in Little Rock, Ark., on April 20. She plans other appearances in Missouri and other states.

Dingell's defeat a victory for Calif. extremists
\
Dearborn Democrat favored more rational environmental policies
\
Aside from being an unconscionable way to treat the longest-serving member of Congress and a man who has given his heart and soul to the Democratic Party, the decision by Rep. John Dingell's colleagues to strip him of his chairmanship of the Energy and Commerce Committee signals a worrisome lurch to the left by the House.
\
The Democrats didn't choose Rep. Henry Waxman to replace Dingell because the California Democrat is more charming or politically persuasive. They picked him because he advocates a radical approach to combatting global warming and other environmental threats, while Dingell has insisted on a more deliberate approach that balances the needs to protect both jobs and the environment.
\
Clearly, this Congress isn't interested in caution. A country reeling toward an economic collapse will pay a heavy price if the extreme growth-limiting policies advocated by Waxman and his California backers prevail. The new chairman favors a very aggressive schedule for reducing carbon emissions and a ban on the construction of new coal-fired power plants and would limit America's access to the petroleum produced by Canada's rich oil sands.
\
Dingell is a one liberal who understands that working people need jobs. His staunch defense of the auto industry likely helped cost him his job, given the hostility expressed by Congress this week toward the Detroit automakers. But it is rooted in the reality that for the blue-collar autoworkers who populate Dingell's district to thrive, the auto companies that employ them must survive.
\
That's why he carefully structured new fuel economy standards that will meet the goal of reducing oil dependency, but on a timetable that won't bankrupt the automakers. Similarly, Dingell was crafting in his committee a reasonable carbon cap-and-trade strategy that would allow industrial growth to continue while reducing greenhouse gases.
\
Even Dingell's old foe, former Michigan Gov. John Engler, who tried his best to redistrict the congressman out of a job, used a big chunk of his recent speech to the Detroit Economic Club to praise Dingell's leadership on industrial policy.
\
But Congress has chosen instead to embark on a path that will sacrifice economic prosperity on the altar of extreme environmental ideology.
\
We find it fascinating that President-elect Barack Obama, who intervened to save the Homeland Security Committee chairmanship of the prodigal Sen. Joe Lieberman, didn't lift a finger to help Dingell, who is a staunch Democrat.
\
Detroit Rep. Carolyn Cheeks-Kilpatrick also failed to support Dingell, presumably because he had the good sense to call for the resignation of her son, the jailed former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick.
\
The main actor in this move on Dingell is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has been gunning for him for years and now has finally bagged the old lion.
\
Consider this a stark example of how far Michigan has fallen.
\
During the past 40 years, Michigan has lost four congressional seats while California gained 15.
\
The little clout the state has left got a lot smaller with Dingell's defeat Thursday.

Payment coming due for reckless war
\
The bills are coming due for the reckless war on global warming, and they are staggering.
\
Global food prices are up 30 percent since last year, leading to starvation and food riots in the poorest parts of the world, and pinching families everywhere.
\
The sudden price spike is caused in large part by ethanol mandates in the United States that are claiming a third of the corn harvest and 30 million acres that otherwise would be planted in grains and soybeans.
\
The mandates were forced by environmentalists and their political toadies who ignored predictions that ethanol would pit fuel against food.
\
And yet green laws are still being rammed through without assessing their consequences.
\
In Michigan, the Legislature, prodded by Gov. Jennifer Granholm, is near to passing legislation that would mandate the use of renewable fuels in producing electricity. The windmills Lansing wants are a very expensive source of electric power, and yet lawmakers haven't factored how much they'll add to the monthly light bill.
\
Motorists are pleading for relief from rising gasoline prices. Fuel costs are a function of supply and demand. We've placed severe restrictions on oil exploration and refining within our own borders and require expensive gasoline formulas for summertime driving. Guess what? Those policies show up at the pump.
\
And we probably ain't seen nothin' yet. The cap-and-trade carbon scheme being considered by Congress will add 35 cents to a gallon of gasoline, and 20 to 30 percent to electricity costs.
\
The sharp increases in fuel economy standards Congress mandated eventually will tack on $6,000 to $8,000 to an automobile's sticker. How many people will that price out of the new car market?
\
And how many will have to kiss goodbye their dreams of owning a new home because the efficiency standards Michigan wants to impose will hike their mortgage by $7,000 or more?
\
Ultimately, nearly everything we buy will cost more because of environmental mandates that no one can say for certain will actually reduce global warming.
\
For most of us, the rising prices will cut deeply into discretionary spending. Instead of using our money for the things we want, we'll have to budget more of it to finance the environmental agenda.
\
But for the poor -- and there will be many more of them once the full costs hit -- the impact will be devastating, as most of life's staples -- food, housing, transportation -- move further beyond their reach.
\
This won't be allowed to stand, of course. Just as with the ethanol-provoked food crisis, balancing the damage done by ill-conceived policies will require a massive transfer of wealth from the haves to the have-nots.
\
That means higher taxes and a giant step toward socialism in the name of the environment.
\
The eco-lobby never talks about the real costs to real people of its agenda. Imposing hugely expensive regulations without fully weighing their impact on those who will pay for them is irresponsible.
\
We should strive for a cleaner and greener earth. But we also should make sure we can afford to live on it.

Consumers will pay costs of going green
\
The electricity rate hikes pending before state regulators are the result of a number of factors. A price hike would come regardless of the cost of meeting environmental mandates. But those mandates do add to the increase, in one case by about one-third. A public that wants carbon dioxide removed from the air must be prepared to pay for it.
\
Consumers Energy is seeking a rate hike totaling $215 million; Detroit Edison is seeking $378 million. The average residential customer's electricity bill would increase 11 percent. And there will be more hikes to come in the service of greening the environment.
\
In Consumer's case, the rate hike is driven by what the utility believes are necessary improvements in its electric lines and equipment and a modern computer system to prevent outages and improve reliability.
\
But another portion of the requested rate hike is to cover the cost of meeting federal regulations to continue to improve emissions at its plants. As spokesman Dan Bishop noted, the air is much cleaner now than it has been in past decades, but further improving air quality becomes ever more expensive. Roughly a third of the Consumer's hike can be attributed to environmental costs.
\
A small portion of the increase also reflects a state law adopted last year in which residential customers will no longer be subsidized by larger commercial and industrial users. Michigan's industrial users pay rates that have been 10 percent higher than the average for the Midwest.
\
In Edison's case, southeastern Michigan's poor economy, with its declining electricity purchases, along with losses in the utility's investment portfolio needed to cover such fixed costs as pensions and its continuing obligations to meet federal emissions mandates, are the reasons for the rate hike request, a spokesman noted. He couldn't put an exact percentage on the environmental costs, noting the poor economy is the primary driver of the rate request, but added that cost increases cannot be met with reductions in staffing or other money-saving moves by the utility.
\
More environmental costs are on the way. Consumers has separate rate issues pending before the Michigan Public Services Commission, which regulates utilities. One is for an energy efficiency program. Another one is for covering the cost of a new state mandate for the use of renewable energy such as solar and wind power.
\
Both will add to the monthly bill.
\
State law adopted last year requires that alternative energy sources produce 10 percent of the state's energy supply by 2015. The governor this year asked that the state's use of fossil fuels for energy be reduced 45 percent by 2020.
\
Less than 3 percent of the state's electric power supply comes from alternative sources. The utilities will be asking for an additional $3 per month from residential users to meet the state mandate for renewable energy sources.
\
The Obama administration has also proposed a cap-and-trade program in which carbon emitters would bid on emissions permits from the federal government. The administration estimates the permits would produce more than $600 billion in revenue over the next 10 years. Others place the cost to the economy much higher, and those costs will particularly hit coal-burning states such as Michigan and its electricity consumers.
\
Green sources of energy and reductions in carbon emissions are popular goals and make good political sound bites. They are not the only reason utility costs are rising, but they carry a cost that consumers will end up paying.

Coal plant a bad idea
\
Consumers Power's plan to build a $3 billion coal-fired generation plant in Bay City is a bad deal for its rate payers, for Consumers share holders and for the state of Michigan for a lot of reasons: It is not needed and Consumers has not adequately studied alternatives, according to the Michigan Public Service Commission. Consumers' rate payers will pay at least 30 percent more for their electricity and at least 70 percent more if clean coal technologies are built into the plant. Idle or underused natural gas fired turbines, already constructed, could provide three times the electricity of the proposed Bay City plant.Consumers should withdraw its unneeded Bay City plant proposal and concentrate on future technologies that will leave Michigan healthy, wealthy and bright.

Snow not counter to warming
\
The Detroit News has confused its readers by claiming that record snowfall on the East Coast somehow proves that climate change isn't real. The record snowfall in the East and sparse snowfall in Vancouver are merely episodic weather events. Climate change refers to long-term trends that have been recorded over decades and centuries. Using that long-term data, there is no question that the planet is warming. The consequences of ignoring this global crisis will be dire.
\
It's time for Americans and our elected leaders to confront climate change by reducing global warming pollution with a clean energy economy.

Green jobs possible
\
With unemployment at almost 15 percent in Michigan, we need action now to create good jobs in our state and across the country. We can do that by investing in clean energy now. Passing comprehensive climate change and clean energy legislation will rapidly put millions of Americans back to work and establish the United States as a leader in the development of clean energy technologies. A report by the Blue Green Alliance shows that Michigan can create more than 34,000 manufacturing jobs in our existing manufacturing infrastructure if we take common sense steps at the national level, like implementing a federal Renewable Electricity Standard and adopting cap-and-trade. Michigan senators should be leading the way to create clean energy jobs with legislation that includes safeguards for energy-intensive industries and investments in making our homes and businesses energy efficient.

Senate needs to step up
\
Our U.S. Senators need to get to work passing strong, comprehensive clean energy and climate change legislation that will create good jobs, increase America's energy independence and leave a better environment for future generations. Reports show that comprehensive legislation can create almost 54,000 jobs in Michigan and 1.7 million jobs nationwide. Those are jobs building the next generation of energy production that will ensure we can use our homegrown energy, instead of importing foreign oil from overseas. Clean energy and climate change legislation will get people to work in Michigan. The U.S. House has already done their job, now it's time for the Senate to get it done.

62,"Climate change is surely the looming disaster of our time.\Scientists say it's inevitable that sea levels will rise 21/2-61/2 feet -- sufficient to endanger or wipe out many cities. One scientist believes that, in the long term, 69 feet of sea level rise is inescapable.\And the source of the swelling oceans -- rising temperatures -- will stress the nation's food system, while the increasing number of devastating storms will place an economic burden on a nation reeling from disaster to disaster, patching its wounds without effecting meaningful change.\It's tempting to dismiss these projections as hysterical. That life as we know it could change so dramatically, so quickly, seems impossible. But on this topic, the scientific community (if not the political one) speaks with one voice.\Despite the evidence -- rising temperatures, powerful storms, droughts and fires -- no significant action has been taken that would limit the impacts of climate change. Until last Tuesday.\President Barack Obama delivered a bold proposal for a set of regulatory changes that could turn the U.S. from its headlong rush into disaster. This is the course our nation must take if we are to preserve our way of life, and we're energized to see the president championing such vital reform.\Obama's plan calls for carbon pollution standards for new and existing power plants, efficiency standards that would reduce carbon pollution by at least 3billion cumulative metric tons by 2030, fuel economy standards for heavy duty vehicles, the reduction of greenhouse gases and the development of a comprehensive methane strategy. It also provides federal support for local investment to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.\The plan is sure to impact the way Americans live -- or at least the way we pay bills. But that's preferable to the alternative.\It won't be easy to turn the nation from habits we've indulged for decades, though the true costs of capping carbon emissions are still unknown, and likely won't be as severe as naysayers' predictions. (Remember: Cap and trade was offered during the George Bush adminsitration as a ""conservative"" alternative to harsher regulation; now the nation's right wing villifies it as a kind of commie profit-killer. Truth is often the victim of political rhetoric in this debate.)\But for that reason -- not to mention that some obdurate lawmakers still deny the basic facts of climate change endorsed by the entire scientific community -- the president is unlikely to find support in Congress for the path we believe he must pursue.\Indeed, some members of Congress have made their careers by obstructing just such measures. Sadly, many of those whose denials of the causes and impacts of climate change ring the loudest represent the coastal areas most vulnerable to rising seas, an act of self-immolation that's impossible to understand.\Obama's climate change plan was heralded by these intransigent members as ""job killing,"" irresponsible and an abuse of executive fiat. (""War on coal"" we'll accept -- the plan does take aim at coal, but 38% of greenhouse gas emissions are caused by power plants, most of which burn coal; the next biggest culprit is transportation, accounting for 31%. And these changes needn't kill jobs -- developing alternative energy technologies should provide new sources of employment.)\As a steward of America and American resources, for Obama to sit this one out is unacceptable. And remember that late in the 2012 presidential campaign, it was Obama's promise to deal with climate change that wooed some unsure voters to his side. So what's a responsible president to do?\Well, the president says he doesn't need Congress. Rather, Obama says the broad reforms he envisions can be implemented by executive order, expanding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's regulatory oversight of pollution to include carbon emissions. That's a use of executive order that is sure to prompt legal and political battles. It's also worth nothing that Obama is the second American president to define the powers of the executive in broad terms, insisting that the office carries authority and autonomy traditionally not exercised by American presidents.\Obama's willingness to circumnavigate Congress is a regrettable necessity.\In an ideal world, lawmakers would be swayed by the preponderance of scientific evidence, reach consensus and move to enact regulations that protect our environment. But that's not what has happened. For a legislator to accept that climate change is happening has become a political, not scientific, decision.\And while we're wary of the increasing power of the presidency, what could be a more appropriate use of that power than to turn the country from environmental devastation?\Editorial"
63,"
Everyone agrees it's time to raise the bar to promote fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse emissions.
\
Now the important question is: What's the best way to get cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars on the road, while preserving good-paying automotive manufacturing jobs?
\
Here are some of the key points that concern our members:
\
¥ We need a comprehensive solution. Automobiles account for just 16 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Legislation that focuses on autos alone and leaves out the rest of the economy will fail. We need an economywide solution, like the carbon cap-and-trade proposal being developed by House Energy and Commerce Chair John Dingell. It would require all industries -- including Big Oil, utility companies, and all manufacturers -- to take action to reduce greenhouse gases, or to trade for carbon permits from more energy-efficient companies or industries.
\
¥ We're making progress. UAW members right now build many fuel-efficient vehicles, including hybrids like the Ford Escape, the Saturn Vue, and the Chevy Silverado, and clean diesel vehicles like the Jeep Liberty. We should build on this progress -- not derail it with extreme proposals.
\
¥ We can't impose unbearable costs on our domestic auto industry.
\
Some current proposals in Congress would hit the industry from both ends, forcing Chrysler, Ford and GM to curtail production of larger vehicles while encouraging them to move small car production overseas.
\
Our members would get caught in the middle, with tens of thousands of jobs and the pension and health benefits of retired workers at risk.
\
Fortunately, there's no need to make such a drastic mistake.
\
U.S. Reps. Lee Terry, R-Nebraska, and Baron Hill, D-Indiana, have offered a sensible, bipartisan alternative that requires a substantial boost in fuel economy standards.
\
Their plan will raise Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards by 28 to 40 percent, requiring the total fleet of passenger cars and light trucks sold in the U.S. to achieve an average fuel economy level between 32 and 35 miles per gallon by 2022.
\
It's a tough new standard -- but it's one that both domestic and foreign companies can achieve.
\
By contrast, Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Edward Markey's extreme CAFE proposal would impose huge costs on domestic manufacturers, but a far lower burden on foreign-based companies, which have a different vehicle mix and would not face the same kind of re-tooling costs.
\
Energy policy should not be separated from our nation's overall economic goals. A dangerous plan which threatens U.S. jobs and U.S. companies doesn't make sense in the long run.
\
Also, the bill introduced by Reps. Terry and Hill would continue the longstanding distinction in the CAFE program between domestic and foreign passenger car fleets, which protects small car production and jobs in the U.S.
\
The CAFE measure recently approved by the Senate would repeal this domestic-foreign fleet distinction.
\
As a result, manufacturers would no longer need to keep small car production here to balance production of larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles. The inevitable result would be the offshoring of small-car production.
\
This has no relationship to making fuel economy standards more or less stringent. Sending small car production to China or Mexico won't save a single drop of oil -- but it will cost the jobs of thousands of workers in the auto and parts industries.
\
UAW members who build the Toyota Corolla in California, the Chevy Cobalt in Ohio, the Dodge Caliber in Illinois and the Ford Focus in Michigan are on the cutting edge of America's effort to improve fuel economy.
\
Our public policy should support these workers -- and workers throughout our industry who are working hard to deliver quality, fuel-efficient vehicles to American consumers.
\
The U.S. has already lost hundreds of thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs due to failed policies on health care, trade and other issues.
\
It would be a sad mistake to add a failed energy policy to this list, instead of taking this opportunity to make real progress on jobs and the environment.

64,"WASHINGTON - General Motors Corp. chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner slapped down comments made by a top company executive that called global warming a ""crock,"" saying he did not agree with them.\GM Vice Chairman Bob Lutz recently called global warming ""a crock"" and completed the colorful expression with an expletive, drawing enormous attention by bloggers and others.\""The comments weren't coming out of our company,"" Wagoner said today at an hour-long breakfast with reporters, noting the company has made its strategy clear to address legitimate societal concerns about climate change. Wagoner said he didn't agree with Lutz's comment.\""The data is pretty clear that the temperature on the earth is rising. There's all sort of debates as to why but we've clearly come down on the side it makes sense for us to put our business in a position where we can participate proactively in reducing the amount of (carbon dioxide) emissions,"" Wagoner said.\GM was the first automaker to join USCAP, a group of businesses that supports a mandatory cap and trade system on greenhouse-gas emissions.\Lutz defended his position in a blog posting on a company website on Feb. 21\""An offhand comment I made recently about the concept of global warming seems to have a lot of people heated, and it's spreading through the Internet like ragweed.... My beliefs are mine and I have a right to them, just as you have a right to yours. But among my strongest beliefs is that my job is to do what makes the most business sense for GM,"" Lutz wrote. ""General Motors is dedicated to the removal of cars and trucks from the environmental equation, period. And, believe it or don't: So am I! It's the right thing to do, for us, for you and, yes, for the planet.""\Wagoner addressed a number of issues at the breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor:\-- He said GM has a good working relationship with Cerberus Capital Management, to which it sold 51 percent to GMAC in 2006. He said he regularly speaks with Cerberus chief Steve Feinberg. ""Cerberus has been a stand-up partner,"" Wagoner said. ""The relationship has worked very well.""\Wagoner was far more upbeat about GMAC's prospects than Feinberg was in a Jan. 22 letter to investors warning that GMAC may face ""substantial difficulty.""\""I obviously don't have any say in the way Steve writes his letters,"" Wagoner said, saying ""GMAC is quite robust, has absorbed a tough year in the credit market, had a great year in the auto finance business.""\-- Wagoner said the company would keep fighting to prevent California and 16 other states from eventually getting to impose their own strict tailpipe emissions standards. GM has said those standards - requiring a 30 percent reduction in emissions requiring passenger cars to average 43.7 mpg by 2016 -- could force it to stop selling 80 percent of its vehicles in California. ""I don't think it's the right thing for the country,"" he said.\On Jan. 2, California and the other states sued to overturn the Environmental Protection Agency's denial of their request to impose the standards.\-- Wagoner expressed optimism that the ongoing strike by the United Auto Workers against American Axle Manufacturing Holdings Inc. would be resolved.\He said full size pickups and SUVs were most affected by the American Axle strike - and the company has plenty of inventory in those areas. ""The impact on our retail sales has been negligible,"" he said. ""It's not a huge issue for us."" However, he said, the parts supply disruption caused by the strike would cut GM's first-quarter production.\-- Wagoner said GM's decision to lend its former parts unit, Delphi Corp. up to $2.825 billion through an affiliate ""doesn't' have any impact of our view on our long-term engagement with Delphi."" He declined to say if he thought Delphi would be able to raise the $3.3 billion in the credit markets to emerge or whether the private equity investors would stick with the plan.\-- Wagoner talked about the presidential campaign and noted he hadn't attended a speech made at the Detroit Economic Club last May by presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama that harshly criticized auto executives. ""I've seen it - I think about 12 times,"" Wagoner said.\Wagoner also noted that all of the presidential candidates will be interested in the environment and in the sputtering economy. ""There is almost no engine for economic growth like the auto sector,"" he said.\Wagoner said the company wouldn't endorse any candidate.\""There's a commonality of interest with whoever is elected,"" Wagoner said. ""It's in our interest to work with whoever is elected.""\-- Wagoner tweaked his rivals, Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Co., noting that GM had only started 0 percent interest incentives on Chevy Silverado pickup trucks a week ago. ""Only because Ford and Toyota did it first.... It's all their fault,"" Wagoner said.\-- Wagoner again denied the company had too many brands and pointed to GM's plan to group brands together at dealerships, like Pontiac, Buick and GMC, allowing it ""more distinctively positioned products.""\""We are going to be able to narrow the product line of Pontiac, Buick and GMC and build the brands with fewer products.""\-- Wagoner said the company had dramatically improved its competitive stance in North America.\GM spent $103 billion on funding pensions and health care between 1993 and 2008, or about $7 billion a year, Wagoner said. The labor agreement ""will dramatically limit future health care expenses.""\GM will able to reduce that $7 billion annual figure to about $1 billion, Wagoner said. By 2011, GM will have reduced it annual cost structure by ""$11 or $12 billion,"" he said.\GM saw its health care expenses drop from $5.3 billion in 2005 to $4.6 billion in 2007, in large part due to concessions from the UAW. It also insures about 1 million people, about 100,000 less than it did in 2005.\* Wagoner said the United States ""is way behind, way behind"" in battery technology. That technology is essential to making plug-in hybrids and vehicles like the Chevrolet Volt--- a concept car that can go 40 miles on battery power alone -- a reality. GM plans to start producing the Volt in late 2010. He said the lack of federal battery research funding has put the country ""at a competitive disadvantage.""\You can reach David Shepardson at (202) 662 - 8735 or dshepardson@detnews.com."
65,"In his eight years as Michigan's attorney general, Bill Schuette has been a champion for Michigan's environment in approximately the same sense that Bill Clinton has been a poster boy for marital fidelity.\But another statewide election is drawing nigh — and unless I miss my guess, voters are about to be subjected to a glossy advertising campaign that portrays the Republican gubernatorial nominee as a stalwart defender of Michigan's air, land and water.\Expect to see video of a shirt-sleeved Schuette listening compassionately to Flint residents whose water was poisoned on Gov. Rick Snyder's watch (which coincided, for those keeping score at home, with Schuette's own). An accompanying voice-over will remind viewers that the attorney general did not hesitate to prosecute officials from his own party for their conduct in Flint's environmental catastrophe.\Since Flint's aggrieved residents account for only a negligible slice of the electorate, the voice-over will insist that Schuette's relentless pursuit of fellow Republicans who screwed up in Flint is only the latest instance in which the AG has put the defense of Michigan's natural resources ahead of his own political interests.\This is, of course, a whopper of Orwellian proportions. And before the myth of Schuette as environmental steward gains any traction in the public consciousness, voters would do well to remember a few salient highlights of his tenure as Michigan's top law enforcement officer:\Schuette was among the group of Republican attorneys general who sued to block the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan, the centerpiece of U.S. efforts to meet its obligations under the Paris Accord to reduce greenhouse gases. The campaign to stave off restrictions on emissions from power plants fueled by coal and other fossil fuels was led by then-Oklahoma AG Scott Pruitt, who scuttled the Clean Power Plan entirely after Donald Trump tapped him to lead (and defang) the Environmental Protection Agency.\Pruitt was forced to resign last month after a tenure plagued by scandal, but his acting successor has outlined a new, weaker coal regulation plan that would (according to the EPA's own projections) boost pollution-related fatalities by as much as 1,400 deaths a year.\In 2015, Schuette enlisted in a similar lawsuit to block enforcement of the Waters of the United States rule, a regulation the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had crafted to curb pollution of rivers, streams and wetlands that feed larger bodies of water like the Great Lakes and the Chesapeake Bay.\Pruitt's EPA also suspended enforcement of that rule, and the agency is planning to replace it with a new one that places fewer restrictions on farmers, ranchers and real estate developers who bridled at the original.\In an earlier sally against federal clean air initiatives, Schuette intervened in the U.S. Court of Appeals for District of Columbia to oppose the EPA's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, which limited emissions and created a ""cap and trade"" program to prevent upwind states from fouling the air of neighboring states downwind.\Long before he became the fossil fuel industry's most important water-carrier in Lansing, moreover, Schuette was one of its best friends in the U.S. Congress. During his two terms two terms in the U.S. House, he consistently supported industry efforts to limit oil companies' liability for environmental damage caused by oil spills. He also voted to weaken standards for automotive pollution control devices.\For consistently opposing state and federal initiatives to curb air and water pollution, congressman Schuette earned a lowly 32 percent score from the bipartisan League of Conservation Voters. Later, as a Michigan state senator, Schuette incurred the organization's renewed disapproval for sponsoring legislation to permit energy companies to drill for oil and natural gas under Michigan's portion of the Great Lakes.\So, probably no one is going to name Schuette as Michigan's Environmentalist of the Year, unless the award sponsor is Koch Industries and the year is 1959. Still, doesn't he deserve props for his efforts to identify those responsible for Flint's catastrophic water crisis and bring them to justice?\Well, maybe — although Schuette's office was late to take an interest in Michigan's worst man-made environmental disaster, and it remains unclear whether the highest-profile targets of his multimillion-dollar investigation will ever be convicted of (or plead guilty to) the serious criminal charges Schuette has brought against them.\Nick Lyon, the Snyder administration's public health chief, was bound over earlier this month for trial on involuntary manslaughter charges in the deaths of two elderly men who were treated for Legionnaires' disease at a hospital on Flint's tainted water system. Schuette's decision to prosecute Lyon has enraged critics as diverse as Snyder, former Democratic Attorney General Frank Kelley, and former Republican state Supreme Court Justice Maura Corrigan. Some see the prosecution as a ham-handed effort to enlist Lyon as the star witness in an even more spectacular homicide case against Snyder; most regard it as a political stunt doomed to end in Lyon's eventual acquittal.\David Uhlmann, a University of Michigan Law professor who was the top environmental crimes prosecutor at the U.S. Department of Justice from 2000 to 2007, says government officials betrayed the residents of Flint and should be held accountable. But he contends that the prosecutions do not change the fact that Schuette did nothing to help Flint residents before the water crisis and has sued to block clean water and clean air programs at every turn.\""Whatever the outcome in Flint, I look at an attorney general with the worst environmental record this side of Scott Pruitt, and I see a cynical, transparent effort to burnish environmental credentials that are otherwise non-existent,"" Uhlmann says.\Lyon's attorneys say they'll file a motion seeking to quash District Court Judge David Goggins' order binding their client over for trial. But even if they're unsuccessful, it's unlikely a trial will get underway before Schuette's term as attorney general ends on Jan. 1, much less before the Nov. 6 election.\By then, the charges against Lyon will have served the purpose of whatever political calculations may have prompted them. So it will likely be up to a new attorney general to decide whether to proceed with what is roundly perceived as a flimsy case.\In the meantime, voters should keep a lookout for campaign ads that exploit Schuette's theatrics in Flint to distract their attention from a career marked by sympathy for industrial polluters, hostility toward environmental regulation, and indifference to the threat of global warming.\Brian Dickerson is the Free Press' editorial page editor.

(photo gallery)\Roughly 4,000 packed the area around the pond to hear several speakers, including Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher, better known as Joe the Plumber.\In addition to local residents, the event drew people from northern Michigan, Ohio and California.\The ""tea party"" is making a 33-city tour across the country that started Aug. 28 in California and will end Saturday with a stop in Washington, D.C. The tour is sponsored by a conservative Republican Political Action Committee called Our Country Deserves Better.\The gathering in Brighton featured shouting matches between a counter-demonstration of local Democrats, who chanted ""Jesus was a liberal."" They were met with a drowning chorus of ""kill the bill."" Besides the chants, the crowd remained peaceful.\""I just want to be a part of this protest of what is going on with our government, that's about it,"" Plymouth Township resident Bob Van Slyke said.\He said he's upset with ""almost everything"" Obama has done.

69,"An hour before the Tea Party Express gathering Tuesday, hundreds of people began strolling towards Brighton's Mill Pond carrying American flags and signs mocking health-care reform and big government.\They came to protest President Barack Obama, socialism, health-care reform, big government, government spending, national debt and as one sign stated, ""throwing granny under the bus."" (photo gallery)\Roughly 4,000 packed the area around the pond to hear several speakers, including Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher, better known as Joe the Plumber.\In addition to local residents, the event drew people from northern Michigan, Ohio and California.\The ""tea party"" is making a 33-city tour across the country that started Aug. 28 in California and will end Saturday with a stop in Washington, D.C. The tour is sponsored by a conservative Republican Political Action Committee called Our Country Deserves Better.\The gathering in Brighton featured shouting matches between a counter-demonstration of local Democrats, who chanted ""Jesus was a liberal."" They were met with a drowning chorus of ""kill the bill."" Besides the chants, the crowd remained peaceful.\""I just want to be a part of this protest of what is going on with our government, that's about it,"" Plymouth Township resident Bob Van Slyke said.\He said he's upset with ""almost everything"" Obama has done. Van Slyke said he doesn't want health care run by big government.\Even though the administration has rejected a single payer health insurance system, Van Slyke said, ""I don't believe him.""\Van Slyke said Obama has been talking about a government-run program for years.\Diane Krieg and her husband, Ron, have been traveling with the Tea Party Express since it left California. The retired couple have been living in a 31-foot motorhome as they attend the rallies. They've decorated their motorhome with pictures of their children and several anti-Obama signs, including ""Obama: Keep the change.""\""We're just trying to be heard,"" Diane Krieg said.\She fears the government is headed toward ""socialism.""\""It's creeping in,"" she said.\Krieg said she's worried about rising taxes, health care, and cap and trade and a government intruding into everyone's lives.\""I don't want my kids and grandkids to be living in a socialist country,"" Krieg said.\Although surrounded by a crowd opposed to health-care reform, a group of Democrats held their own and held signs calling for health care for everyone.\""I think they're ill-informed,"" Hartland Township resident Carole Gannon said.\Kathy Carney, a Green Oak Township Democrat, said the health-care reform is a ""work in progress.""\""I think we need health care,"" Carney said.\Speaking over chants from the crowd, Charlene Huget, retired director of the Brighton District Library, said she was disappointed by the lack of serious discussion on health care.\""People need to stop and listen to a thoughtful discussion on these issues,"" Huget said. ""I don't see that.""\Judy Daubenmier, chairwoman of the Livingston County Democratic Party, led the supporters in chants during the rally. She estimated they were 100 Democrats who attended the event.\""I think the other side is very misinformed,"" Daubenmier said.\She said many people are being intentionally misled about health-care reform.

Mark Schauer governed against the will of the people. He broke his sacred pledge to represent us - the majority of his constituency - by ramming health care down our throats.
\
He mugged and poisoned a health-care system most Americans cherished.

Prosecutor shames us

\
Well, they can stop wasting my tax dollars on this ridiculous case, as he has passed away.
\
He lived the last 18 months of his life worrying about the prospect of going to prison for 27 years! This was a man who worked all his life, never hurt a fly, and only wanted to use marijuana legally to reduce the pain of his kidney failure and cancer.
\
Our esteemed Prosecutor's Office caused undue stress on a man that people came to say goodbye to from all over the country. He was a respected humanitarian. I hope our public servants will try prosecuting the rapists and murderers as diligently as they went after this man.

Letter had racist tones
\
Everyone has a right to an opinion.
\
However, the letter from Ray Doyle of Holt (Oct. 16) crossed the line. The LSJ should be ashamed for publishing it. This man refers to President Obama as ""Ali Obama and his 40 (plus) thieves.""
\
First of all, this has severely racist connotations to it, not to mention it continues to fuel the ridiculous and ignorant rumors that President Obama is a Muslim and/or not a U.S. citizen - neither of which are the case.
\
As for Doyle's cost of living increase, he should consider where that comes from: Social Security. It's a service his Republican friends have every intention of privatizing and abolishing from government altogether.
\
I hope that, in the future, the LSJ chooses not to print these racist jabs at our president. They are wholly uninformed, unnecessary and divisive. The LSJ should refuse to publish any letters containing derogatory remarks toward anyone's race, creed, religion, sexual orientation or otherwise.

Enforce immigration laws
\
I don't remember seeing coverage in the LSJ of the amicus filing in the U.S. court system by 11 Latin American countries, including Mexico, against the Arizona immigration law. In fact, I had to look quite carefully to find a report of it on the Internet.
\
The filing was supported by the Obama administration through Attorney General Eric Holder. Whether you agree with the law or not, I am shocked that our court system would allow foreign governments to file any kind of brief against one of our own states. There are other avenues for them to use if they don't agree with this issue, but what goes on in our courts is none of their business.
\
These Latin countries claim that the law affects their citizens. Of course it affects their citizens if they enter illegally. I believe they are afraid it will reduce drug money from the U.S. and money sent home to their countries by illegals living in this country. Why can't we actually enforce the laws we have?

Look at debt history
\
The U.S. national debt is more than $13 trillion. Just where did the money go?
\
The day before 9/11, Donald Rumsfeld, then secretary of defense, announced that the Pentagon couldn't account for $2.3 trillion.
\
George Bush cooked up Iraq War, which cost $3 trillion. Instead of paying for the war, he cut taxes. It was completely funded by borrowing.
\
You can thank Ronald Reagan for the $14 trillion Social Security liability. His Federal Reserve chair, Alan Greenspan, saw there would be shortages in the future and created a fund to cover the shortfall, but Reagan had given so many tax cuts to the rich that the government was facing bankruptcy.
\
So, Reagan emptied the fund to pay for other things.

Are you worried about the use of nuclear power plants in the United States?
\
Concerned about shortcuts
\
Do I worry about nuclear facilities? Sure. Big business and utility companies will do anything to make a buck, even cutback on safety measures. How do these guys sleep at night? They helped the company profit. Shortcuts are taken because some businesses ignore or skirt regulations at the expense of anybody, so you can be sure some of our nuclear power plants need attention. Remember the Gulf of Mexico oil platform and the Exxon Valdez?

\
We need the energy
\
Not at all! We have a great need for energy in this country and nuclear power is a great way to produce it. Of course there are always risks associated with energy production, but the need far outweighs the risk. The media and some politicians have used the disaster in Japan to further their agenda and scare the American public.
\
Seth Schmidtmann
\
Lansing
\
There are always risks
\
Answer: There will always be things to worry about. We could worry about the new demands on the electric power grid that are bound to result from the widespread use of electric cars. If we all reverted to buggies and wood stoves, we'd soon be worrying about messy streets and soaring firewood prices. Life has gotten more complicated, but there are other matters more urgent and immediate than a regional meltdown for me to be really worried about.
\

\
Nuclear power too dangerous
\
There is no legitimate long term use for nuclear power anywhere. Nuclear accidents pose short term risks for human health and environmental damage. Spent fuel can neither be safely recycled nor stored forever. All nuclear plants are subject to naive safety design, human error and malicious attacks.
\
Jim Waun
\

\
Our government is careful
\
No. The worries about nuclear plant meltdowns went away in this state (and the country) I believe back in the 70s and I trust our government to be totally up to speed on this issue. There is a lot of media frenzy and hype right now due to the Japan situation. Fortunately, living in Michigan, one thing I don't worry much about is an earthquake.
\

\
We need nuclear power
\
Actually, I am far more worried about the lack of nuclear power plants in the United States. Our country runs on power, and we need to replace the old polluting power plants with clean nuclear power plants. There are three reasons for less concern here than in Japan:
\
1. 1. We are not a small, densely populated island nation; we have plenty of land that will not likely be hit with tsunamis or major earthquakes
\
2. 2. Newer nuclear power plants have a higher safety factor than the older plants that were damaged in Japan
\
3. 3. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has learned much from Japan's experience that will help us avoid their problems
\
William L. Brown

\
Policies too restrictive
\
No I never have been, but it would not matter anyway. Burning coal to produce electricity is bad, because of global climate change. Do you remember a few years ago when it was called global warming before winters turned really cold? We can't drill for oil in a frozen Alaska wasteland, because some caribou may be disturbed. How were oil wells drilled all around Alma and Mt. Pleasant without killing all the wildlife and people? Even if we could find more oil, it would be impossible to build a refinery to produce any gas or diesel fuel.

Push renewable energy
\
Nuclear power plants are pretty safe in this country. They are regulated well and inspected thoroughly on a regular basis. What is happening in Japan is the result of a natural disaster the likes of which don't happen often in North America, other than the west coast. That said, I would still prefer alternate sources of energy that do not involve burning fossil fuels or leaving waste that must be disposed of and contained for a half-million years. Let's push wind, solar, and geothermal power, and allow Mother Nature to provide what we need.
\
Michael Kavanagh

\
It could happen here, too
\
Worried? You bet your bippy. If nuclear energy enthusiasts aren't taking sharp notice of the situation in Japan and rethinking their advocacy, then we're in big trouble. I don't want to hear that it can't happen here. It has, and with virtually no spending on energy infrastructure and no real regulation, why on earth would we think it won't happen again?
\
Susan Robertson
\
Lansing
\
Too much has gone wrong
\
Yes, two things trouble me, first, why do they locate nuclear plants were there is potential for extreme weather? It would be prudent to use alternate sources of energy where there is any chance of volatile weather occurring. And, why do engineers sound so cock sure of themselves when proposing construction of nuclear plants, extracting natural gas, and oil drilling and then scramble to justify why something went wrong? Anything less then 100 percent performance is unacceptable when dealing with human life and our eco system.

Need alternate energy sources
\
I am not worried about a melt down of our nuclear power plants, but I do think it is in our country's best interest to find better ways to create energy. We cannot put all of our hope in one form of energy, we need to continue to expand our thinking about this, and perhaps find ways to use less energy instead of trying to create more. Energy conservation should be a focus for the future, along with green energy sources. Nuclear power is a reality in our country for now, but this is a topic that voters should pay much more attention to in the future.

We need power
\
No. We are not likely to have an earthquake of the magnitude that hit Japan. We must not permit the ""cap and trade"" type eco-terrorists to use this as a pretext to turn off our power and leave us in the dark.

Worth the risk
\
Everything in life has risk vs. reward associated with it. Our economy is based on the availability of energy to heat our home, power our plants and fuel our transportation. So I ask myself, what is the real risk involved in nuclear power and is it worth it. No question that nuclear power is less harmful to the environment, it is cheaper electricity than alternatives, and reduces our dependence on foreign oil. The risk factors involve an accident, like Three Mile Island, which by the way was contained with no loss of life. So the worst case scenario is an accident caused by either nature's forces or employee error and some number of people die or are otherwise affected. How many people die annually from air pollution and how has acid rain (from coal burning power plants) affected lakes and people's health? I say the risk is worth it and while we should engineer every safeguard we can into these plants, we need to continue building them.

Holt
\
We must be vigilant
\
No. There's no way that we can eliminate all risk from our lives. Nuclear power plants in America have proven to be very safe, efficient and reliable in providing energy. Of course, our federal and state regulators need to continue to be vigilant in helping monitor current and new plants to ensure that there is as little risk as possible for harm to U.S. citizens. We need to continue to pray to the Father for wisdom in building, maintaining, and quickly rectifying any problems that might occur in the future.

Look closely at reactors
\
I hadn't thought about them much until now. Nothing I've learned convinces me that nuclear energy is the safest or most economical power source for the future. Seeing the suffering in Japan due to uncontrollable forces - an earthquake, a tsunami, with possible high levels of harmful radiation being released, the U.S. should be looking more closely at the safety of our reactors. While nuclear power has been around for more than 50 years, its use has not been perfected.

Review emergency plans
\
In light of what's happening in Japan I'm a little more concerned than I have been. The U.S. needs to ensure that we are meeting safety guidelines in these plants. They need to also assure there are evacuation plans in place in the community where these plants are located. These plans need to be revisited and the dust taken off to ensure that we are ready to react if a natural disaster happens or an accident.

\
We can't stop our lives
\
No. We can't stop living our lives because accidents happen. All sources of energy have risks. Environmental wackos say drilling kills the earth, but drilling in other countries don't bother them. It's the same earth! Of all nation using nuclear energy, I trust the U.S. for safety and oversight. We should use a combination of drilling, nuclear, coal, etc., to stop our enemies from controlling our destiny. Remove the Gulf moratorium and drill everywhere now!

Learn and go forward
\
One might debate the wisdom of placing fragile nuclear plants in an earthquake/tsunami prone region. But we can't ignore the importance of or stop exploring alternative energy sources based on fear. We either learn from the unfolding tragedy and create better systems or stay forever mired in a world of oil dependency outside of our control.

YPSILANTI - The line snaked for several blocks as more than 9,000 people crowded into the Convocation Center at Eastern Michigan University to see Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders during his first visit to Michigan this election season.
\
The crowd, mostly young people, came to hear his messages on income inequality, the need for campaign finance reform and aggressive action to protect the environment. And Sanders did not disappoint.
\
""The issue that we're dealing with now: whether or not we're going to have a government which represents all of the people of our country or whether we're going to have a government owned and controlled by wealthy contributors,"" he said. ""We have a corrupt campaign finance system, which is undermining American democracy. We have a system in which a small number of people are making huge campaign contributions.""
\
He played to the crowd, with a call for providing free college tuition, refinancing student debt at the lowest possible interest rate, removing marijuana from the schedule 1 list of illegal controlled substances and raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour.
\
And he encouraged the crowd to turn out to vote during the primary on March 8 and continue the momentum that his campaign gained with a landslide victory in New Hampshire last week.
\
""Our campaign has come a very long way in the last nine months. When we began, we were 30 points down in New Hampshire. Well, it didn't quite turn out that way. When we began, we were way down in Michigan, and it ain't going to turn out that way, either,"" he said. ""What this campaign is about, in a very focused political way, is that we do well when turnout is large. We could struggle and lose when turnout is low.
\
""You are the future of the country. You're not going to stand aside while a handful of campaign contributors determine the future,"" he said.
\
In Dearborn, talking at a UAW local union hall, Sanders touched on issues of trade, saying he didn't support the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement and promised to rebuild manufacturing in America, not China.
\
""We don't need unfettered free trade. We need fair trade,"" he said.
\
The coveted endorsement of the UAW wasn't delivered at the Dearborn event, although he received a rousing reception.
\
""We are going through our (endorsement) process ... we are right now surveying our members,"" UAW President Dennis Williams said last week. ""I think right now, people are conflicted. I think right now, people are watching with interest what the candidates are saying.""
\
Sanders' message in Ypsilanti resonated with the crowd, which repeatedly hooted and hollered at the points they liked and booed when he talked about Republicans and two of the wealthiest families in America -- the Waltons, who own Walmart and much more, and the Koch Brothers, who are generous campaign donors to GOP candidates and causes.
\
""He is the most forward-thinking and progressive candidate,"" said Connor Priest, 20, a sophomore at the University of Michigan, who counts income inequality and getting the money out of politics as his top concerns. ""His ideas are best for the future of the country. I like Hillary (Clinton), as well. I like a lot of what she stands for, but I don't think she's strong enough on some of the issues.""
\
For Sarah Gallagher, an earth and environmental student at U-M, Sanders is the only candidate who's talking about a carbon tax.
\
""I'm really concerned about the environment, so I love what Bernie has to say,"" she said.
\
The Flint water crisis, which Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has been focusing on in debates, interviews and a visit to the city last week, also came up as Sanders said he met with seven people from Flint before his rally.
\
""I obviously have read the newspapers, but I really did not know how ugly and horrible it is, what is going on in the community. It is beyond my comprehension that in the year 2016, we are poisoning children,"" he said. ""But if the local government can't protect those children, the state government can't protect those children, then the federal government better get in there and protect those children.""
\
The Michigan Republican Party was quick to jump on Sanders' proposals, saying they would only hurt Michiganders.
\
""His tax-and-spend liberal policies would place an undue burden on hard-working taxpayers, causing job losses and further damaging our national economy,"" Ronna Romney McDaniel, the Michigan Republican Party chairwoman, said in a statement.
\
And at the same time as Sanders' rally, Republican presidential candidate John Kasich was speaking to students at Michigan State University in East Lansing before heading to Utica for a town hall meeting at the Macomb County Republican Party's headquarters.

75,"Though Democratic presidential candidates are unified on reversing President Donald Trump's scaling back of climate change efforts, differences emerge among the candidates on how nuclear power, natural gas and the controversial Green New Deal fit into their plans.\Climate change and environmental issues are front and center priorities for Democratic voters.\A survey of likely Democratic presidential primary voters in Michigan, conducted for the nonprofit environmental group Michigan League of Conservation Voters found 75% of respondents see climate change as a very serious problem or a crisis. The survey, done by the Global Strategy Group in mid-December, also showed 86% of likely primary voters would be more apt to support a candidate who has a plan to take immediate action on climate change by moving the United States to a 100% clean energy economy — 21% of respondents said they would disqualify a candidate without such a plan.\Lisa Wozniak, executive director of the league, based in Ann Arbor, said she and counterparts across the country are urging the Democratic candidates to prioritize and publicly commit to ambitious plans to combat climate change.\""We're challenging them to prove that climate action is a top priority to them,"" she said. ""What are they really doing to have the biggest and boldest plan?""\Protecting Michigan's drinking water and the Great Lakes from toxic contamination topped the list of environmental priorities in choosing a candidate in the Global Strategy Group survey, at 47%. And respondents almost unanimously — 97% — support immediate action to set tougher standards for PFAS chemicals and to force the military to clean up PFAS contamination in communities near military bases.\The idea that people have to choose between the environment or a good economy is a ""false dichotomy,"" Wozniak said.\""It has never been less true in the task before us, which is to protect our climate and our fresh water,"" she said. ""I believe we will see economic gain in the investments we make.""\Candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren most enthusiastically embrace the Green New Deal, a nonbinding House resolution introduced by Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Edmund Markey of Massachusetts. That plan calls for the U.S. to meet 100% of its energy demand through clean, renewable, zero-emission energy sources via a 10-year mobilization, among numerous other goals, including combating inequality and providing access to quality, affordable health care.\Chloe Grigsby, 21, of Muskegon, is a senior at Michigan State University, studying comparative cultures and politics. She calls herself a ""definite voter"" in Michigan's March 10 Democratic presidential primary, and in the Nov. 3 general election.\Climate change ""has been hugely important for me, especially as a young person in the generation that's going to really have to deal with the brunt of the issues that climate change is going to cause,"" she said.\Grigsby said she has been disappointed in the direction of Trump's administration — ""and the country in general"" — on climate and environmental matters. Trump has characterized climate change as a hoax and scaled back environmental regulations and protections for national parks, she noted.\""Not only are we not advancing, but I think we're moving backwards on protecting the climate,"" she said.\Grigsby supports Sanders for president. The independent U.S. senator from Vermont is running for the Democratic nomination.\""For me, the Green New Deal is huge — he helped author that,"" she said. ""His platform is the strongest in terms of spending to combat climate change. I feel like that's what we need in a time where if we don't start repairing the damage now, the damage that gets done is going to be more costly for our country in the long run.""\Critics of the Green New Deal cite its likely costs — the conservative think tank American Action Forum put the cost of implementing Ocasio-Cortez's and Markey's version at up to $93 trillion, or about four-and-a-half times the entire gross domestic product for the U.S. last year.\But that dollar amount has been disputed by fact-checkers. The Green New Deal is more policy aspirations than specifics, and projections of its astronomical cost mostly involve parts of the proposal not directly pertaining to a clean energy transformation. Projections also typically fail to factor any positive economic benefits or job expansion from a transition to cleaner energy and new, more efficient technologies, proponents contend.\Sanders takes the clean energy piece of his plan under the Green New Deal banner even farther than Ocasio-Cortez and Markey, proposing $16.3 trillion to reach 100% renewable energy for electricity and transportation within 10 years and a ""complete decarbonation of the economy by 2050.""\Among the provisions of Sanders' plan is a five-year guarantee of wages for displaced workers in the fossil fuel industry.\Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, calls for a $10 trillion plan to achieve:\Domestic net-zero emissions by 2030, meaning that any emissions are balanced by an equivalent amount of greenhouse gas reductions\100% ""clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy in electricity generation"" by 2035\100% zero emissions for all new light-duty passenger vehicles, medium-duty trucks, and all buses by 2030\100% zero-carbon pollution for all new commercial and residential buildings\One of the most popular alternatives often cited to reduce carbon emissions — nuclear energy, which produces zero atmospheric carbon but instead produces problematic radioactive waste — gets a thumbs-down from Sanders and Warren, among others.\Sanders' plan calls for stopping the construction of new nuclear plants, and phasing out existing ones through the nonrenewal of federal licenses.\""We know that the toxic waste byproducts of nuclear plants are not worth the risks of the technology's benefit, especially in light of lessons learned from the Fukushima meltdown and the Chernobyl disaster,"" Sanders states on his campaign's website. ""To get to our goal of 100 percent sustainable energy, we will not rely on any false solutions like nuclear, geoengineering, carbon capture and sequestration, or trash incinerators.""\Warren, at a September ""climate crisis town hall"" hosted by CNN, said she believes nuclear energy should be phased out by 2035.\One other remaining Democratic presidential candidate, U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, has also professed her opposition to nuclear energy as part of a climate change solution.\""I support the carbon neutrality goals of the Green New Deal and the awareness it has brought across the country on the critical issues of energy independence and the climate crisis,"" Gabbard states on her campaign website. ""However, I do not support 'leaving the door open' to nuclear power unless and until there is a permanent solution to the problem of nuclear waste. I believe we need to invest in 100% renewable and safe energy sources like wind, solar, and geothermal.""\More than 60,000 tons of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel is stored on the shores of four of the five Great Lakes — in some cases, mere yards from the water line — in still-growing stockpiles because promised long-term repositories for the waste in both the U.S. and Canada have not yet materialized.\In contrast, former Vice President Joe Biden calls for a continuation of nuclear power, and studying the use of small, modular, lower-cost nuclear reactors and devising better ways to address the nuclear waste storage problem.\Biden's $5 trillion climate plan — with $1.7trillion of that money coming from federal sources and the rest from states, local governments and private investors — calls for ""a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions no later than 2050."" Among its provisions is expanded infrastructure spending that also addresses the impacts of a changing climate.\Biden touts the accomplishments of ""the Obama-Biden Administration,"" including limits on carbon pollution, doubling fuel economy standards for cars and trucks, expanding renewable, clean energy in the U.S. and helping enact the international Paris Climate Accord, a global action plan to fight climate change.\But that eight-year administration record swings both ways. It means Biden is also wedded to former President Barack Obama's ""all-of-the-above"" energy strategy that, while preserving jobs and increasing energy security, has helped lead to major expansion of America's production and exportation of petroleum, as well as a significant spike in natural gas production — controversial accomplishments among 2020 likely Democratic voters.\Biden's talk has been tough on the topic on the campaign trail. At a New Hampshire stop in September, Biden told an audience member, ""I want you to look at my eyes. I guarantee you. I guarantee you. We're going to end fossil fuel.""\The Trump administration last November formally notified the United Nations that it intends to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord, enacted in December 2015 in which all of the planet's 197 nations pledged to combat climate change and adapt to its impacts. The United States — the world's largest historical emitter of carbon and the second-highest emitter now, behind China — under the agreement committed to cutting overall greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025.\All of the Democratic candidates say they would recommit to the Paris agreement.\One fossil fuel is natural gas, and though it has about half of the carbon emissions of oil and coal, it has proven a point of contention for the Democratic candidates.\Some, like Minnesota U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, support natural gas' use as a ""transition fuel."" Other candidates see gas' carbon emissions as still too problematic.\Warren has called for a ""total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases for drilling offshore and on public lands,"" a view shared by other Democratic candidates, as well as a nationwide ban on the controversial practice of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in which water and chemicals are injected at high pressures into the ground to break up mineral layers and release oil and gas for capture.\Sanders, with co-sponsors, recently introduced in the U.S. Senate a bill to ban fracking nationwide by 2025.\Other Democratic candidates who have supported a fracking ban include Gabbard, billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. Opposed to fracking bans, in addition to Klobuchar, are Biden; former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg; New York billionaire Mike Bloomberg; New York millionaire Andrew Yang; former Maryland U.S. Rep. John Delaney and Colorado U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet.\A citizens group in Michigan has attempted since 2012 to place a proposal on the ballot to ban fracking in the state. The Committee to Ban Fracking in Michigan's 2016 effort toward a ballot initiative failed amid a dispute over whether signatures collected more than 180 days earlier could be counted toward the necessary signatures to force a ballot measure. A new Michigan law signed by then-Gov. Rick Snyder that year codified the 180-day signature limit, but the Charlevoix-based committee continues to challenge that law's constitutionality.\Willie Graham Jr., 42, a lifelong Detroit resident and barber at Detroit Barber Co. on Michigan Avenue, said he has voted in every city, state and national election since he was 18.\His candidate this time around is Bloomberg.\""He's putting his money where his mouth is,"" Graham said. ""He's pledged that if he loses, he will spend his money on getting elected whoever the (Democratic) candidate is. That's putting the people first.""\Environmental policy is only one of several issues that drive Graham's vote, he said. He's also interested in addressing economic disparity and a lack of opportunity for many, and doing more to help homeless people and veterans, he said.\""They're not only drilling — they're fracking for oil. It's messing up the Earth,"" he said. ""When those polar ice caps melt, that's going to flood everybody who lives on the edge of the water — the rich people who aren't doing enough now.""\Bloomberg, however, is not among the Democratic candidates who supports a fracking ban. He has, however, joined other candidates in calling for a moratorium on oil and gas drilling on federal lands and to ""stop the rush to build new gas plants"" for energy, as utilities transition away from coal-burning.\Bloomberg's climate plan doesn't go as far as the Green New Deal proposals, calling for a 50% reduction in carbon emissions across the U.S. by 2050, with 80% clean energy usage ""by the end of his second term of office."" Among Bloomberg's plans is to focus research grants and funding on the communities most affected by coal and other fossil fuel pollution, which are often majority impoverished or populated with people of color.\Buttigieg's $2 trillion climate change plan calls for zero emissions from electricity generation and from new motor vehicles by 2035, creating a ""net-zero emissions society no later than 2050."" He proposes creating a $250billion American Clean Energy Bank to fund locally led clean energy projects, particularly in disadvantaged communities; a 10-year, $250 billion Global Investment Initiative, and grant-making ""Regional Resilience Hubs"" to help communities with climate change-related vulnerabilities.\Buttigieg also supports a carbon tax.\""The key to making a carbon tax work for everyday Americans is to rebate out the value to the American people every year, and do it with a progressive formula so that most people are better off than before,"" Buttigieg said in an interview with City Lab last November.\""The idea of a carbon tax is not to suck money out of the economy and bring it into the government — at least not for me. For me, the idea is to make sure that our prices more accurately reflect the true cost, including the cost to our own future, of things like fossil fuels. We can do that without making most Americans worse off economically if we have a rebate — a dividend, if you will — that goes out to every American based on what's been collected.""\Among the other candidates supporting a carbon tax are Biden, Yang and Delaney.\Sanders, who touted taxing carbon in his 2016 presidential run, now favors ""massively raising taxes on corporate polluters' and investors' fossil fuel income and wealth.""\Steyer proposes a cap-and-trade system, a government-set limit on total carbon emissions, with businesses purchasing credits for every ton of carbon pollution that emanates from their operations annually.\A 2013 report by the Congressional Budget Office concluded that carbon tax or cap-and-trade plans ""would have a negative effect on the economy,"" causing higher prices that diminished the purchasing power of people's earnings; reducing employment and investment, and disproportionately impacting lower-income households.\Proponents of cap-and-trade, however, say it allows the market to determine a price on carbon, spurring innovation and cleaner operation over time.\Some of the Democratic presidential candidates have also addressed per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, the nonstick ""forever chemicals"" once used on stain guards and Teflon pots and pans that persist in the environment and can cause cancer and other health problems. Michigan has 70 known locations where PFAS levels in drinking water exceed the federal government's 70 parts per trillion health advisory limit. But that limit is now regarded as outdated and not protective enough.\In a July op-ed, Warren said, ""As President ... I will take quick, decisive action to end PFAS use on military bases in our communities, enforce strong and effective drinking water standards, and get veterans, service members, and their families the care they need.""\Biden's website also mentions PFAS as an issue he plans to prioritize, but without specifics.\Sanders in December announced he would set tough federal standards for PFAS and other chemicals in drinking water.\""Corporate greed is threatening one of the most basic necessities of life: clean water,"" Sanders said in a statement.\Bernie 2020 Deputy Communications Director Sarah Ford added, ""It's absurd that we have to say this in America in 2020: When you turn on the tap in your home in Michigan, you have a right to expect that the water coming out is clean.""\Contact Keith Matheny: 313-222-5021 or kmatheny@freepress.com.

76,"It is tragic that Congress has run out of gas, so to speak, on energy reform that would include tackling the greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet. At best, that means the issue could make good fodder for the campaign debates that will take place this fall.\But Americans live in an at-worst economy, and the environment will surely take a back seat to concerns about jobs, taxes and other aspects of everyone's financial security. On top of that, those who oppose a cap on emissions have spread an extraordinary amount of hype about the costs of ratcheting back on carbon dioxide, warning that any change would blow yet another hole in most families' well-being. What such fear-mongers neglect to explain is that a carbon-based future looks even more expensive.\For now, Congress could redeem itself by passing strong energy-efficiency measures: helping businesses and households to insulate, upgrade electrical systems and lights, and replace appliances, for example. There are still huge gains to be made in what are known as nega-watts -- removing demand bit by bit from the electrical grid.\But other measures, such as setting minimum thresholds for alternative sources of energy, seem pointless without simultaneously setting a price on carbon-based fuels, be it through a cap-and-trade system on emissions or through a direct carbon tax. Many states, including Michigan, already have set standards for alternate sources of electricity, and federal action ought to be reserved for a well-coordinated strategy that takes global warming gases seriously, once and for all.\A coordinated strategy can take the edge off of increasing energy costs by ensuring that people on fixed incomes and in low-income households get rebates. It should also help ensure that the most efficient types of alternative energy -- not just the most heavily subsidized -- rise to the top. It may help spur more decentralized, even home-based, solutions.\Meanwhile, inaction has its own fallout. Electric utilities face great risk in their long-range planning when they don't know whether they'll face emissions controls for greenhouse gases. Customers will pay the price for decades if their local utilities guess wrong.\Inaction also raises the probability that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will step into the breach, as the U.S. Supreme Court has said it can, and implement emissions controls by regulation. That may prove to be more excruciating than the current contentiousness.\Eventually the results of an incoherent energy policy will inflict the kind of pain that makes Americans demand something real from Congress. Unfortunately, it looks to be a while yet before enough elected officials feel the heat."
77,"Getting to cleaner energy will not be easy, and it will not be cheap. But business as usual could cost Michigan even more.\When critics cite the cost of renewable energy, they generally neglect to mention that all energy will be getting more expensive. Michigan's electricity needs have already outgrown in-state supplies. Increased demand virtually ensures higher prices even by sticking with the status quo, which means Michigan utilities buying more power from sources in other states or building new coal and/or nuclear plants.\So it makes sense to meet as much of the increased demand as possible with renewable, nonpolluting energy sources that are local - wind, solar, methane gas leaving landfills, and so on - while simultaneously ratcheting up conservation measures at home and in factories, offices and stores.\For electricity, the crucial question is whether enough power is available for cooling on the hottest, muggiest afternoons in the summer when utilities hit their peak load. In a perfect world, the answer would come not in new power plants but in reasonable agreements with customers to cut back their use on those days. No electricity is more expensive than the spot purchases made to keep every last air-conditioner running full blast.\But Michigan has barely begun to tap into innovations that conserve energy or make it sustainable even on regular days. Nor has it unleashed its own populace to experiment. As the people writing elsewhere on these pages point out, gains can come in the form of recycled energy, so no bit of heat or light gets wasted, and in new technology as well as alternative power.\Conservation is as important as finding new ways to generate electricity. Rather than a single transforming solution, a clean-energy future is likely to be made up of small applications that come together like a jigsaw puzzle to form a new energy landscape.\The rewards will come not just in savings, but in air that is cleaner and easier to breathe. Stepping away from more fossil fuels to produce electricity also will prepare Michigan for the day when either a national carbon tax or cap-and-trade system on CO{-2} emissions will make electricity even more expensive.\Fossil-fuel electric plants account for about 40% of U.S. carbon dioxide production, with no decrease in sight. Despite the economy, electric demand rose slightly in Michigan last year. Carbon dioxide released from the state's power plants rose even faster - 5% from 2006 to '07, according to the Environmental Integrity Project.\But even discounting global warming concerns, Michigan will benefit from change. The Legislature must proceed with electricity bills that open the floodgates to new forms of energy and put a premium on conservation. The state's utilities need a stable financial platform so they can embrace alternatives; hence, it is essential to return to more regulation. Then the field should be wide open for alternative energy suppliers and even for home-grown experiments to tie into the electric grid.\For Michigan, alternative energy, new technology and conservation can and should be goals in themselves.\(SIDEBAR)\Clean and green\A green Earth is first of all a clean Earth.

Dingell becomes focus of warming fight
\
Dingell is an obstacle
\
As the Oct. 16 article ""Doors close to energy bill"" points out, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell will not vote for a bill to increase fuel efficiency standards to 35 miles per gallon, but supports a bill that would be softer. The auto industry claims this will cost them billions of dollars, yet there is ample research and evidence showing that socially responsible companies outperform irresponsible companies.
\
In light of global warming research recently being awarded a Nobel Peace Prize, it's time for Dingell and Congress to step into the 21st century.

Hold Democrats accountable
\
I was reading yet another story about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and liberal Democrats again trying to take over authority on global warming legislation from U.S. Rep. John Dingell's committee so they can stick it to the auto industry.
\
I have one question for the United Auto Workers: Have you learned anything yet? This is how liberal politicians pay back the UAW for its blind backing? It is time to start holding the Democrat party in Michigan responsible for what their party members in Washington do to our industries instead of ignoring it!

Democrats pursue control
\
It appears that Congressman John Dingell wants to regulate any and all American economic activity (""Dingell: Expand emissions trade plan,"" Oct. 4). Dingell wants to send another army of regulating nannies against American manufacturing (you know, those job providers), already the cleanest and most regulated industries in the world. Can we be sure that the real polluters in the world will follow suit? How soon will it be before individuals have to pay a ""carbon tax"" for breathing? This is today's Democrat party: Control every aspect of the American way of life until it is no longer American -- or free.

Will we wait for the next Katrina to hit the Gulf Coast? Or will we stand up and take bold and decisive action? To protect future generations, U.S. Rep. John Dingell must ensure that the bill he moves through his committee is strong enough to meet the enormity of the challenge of global warming. We must heed the warnings of the scientific experts and reduce our global warming pollution 80 percent by 2050.

Cap-and-trade tax plan would damage Michigan
\
Cap-and-trade tax plan would damage Michigan
\
By Gary Wolfram
\
The proposed $650 billion ""cap and trade"" tax being pushed by the Obama administration will reduce economic growth in the United States, damage Michigan manufacturing, raise consumer costs sharply, increase our reliance on unstable sources of oil and harm free trade, all in the false hope of improving the environment.
\
The purpose of curbing carbon dioxide emissions is supposedly to prevent environmental damage from producing or using fossil fuels, which account for 85 percent of the energy used in the United States.
\
But to make any economic sense, the cap-and-trade tax in the proposed American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 would require that Congress compare the environmental cost per ton of carbon dioxide emissions to the benefit consumers get from the goods and services that are made possible from the use of oil, natural gas and coal. Then Congress would design a system where the benefit from reduced emissions was at least equal to the economic cost of reduced production.
\
No one in Congress has any idea what the cost to the environment of another ton of carbon dioxide is nor has a good idea of the lost value of production from requiring major emitters to purchase allowances. What is clear is that the allowances are being set to generate an enormous amount of tax revenue regardless of what the benefits are to the environment or the costs to the economy.
\
First, the primary argument that carbon dioxide emissions are a cost to the environment is that they contribute to global warming. That is debatable. S. Fred Singer, former director of the U.S. National Weather Satellite Service, argues persuasively in ""Unstoppable Global Warming"" that global warming is a naturally occurring phenomenon.
\
Second, it may be more cost effective to find a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than to prevent it from getting into the atmosphere in the first place. Richard Branson has offered a $25-million prize to anyone who finds a commercially viable method of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Third, the effect on the environment of reductions in U.S. emissions is likely to be overwhelmed by emissions from China, the largest and fastest growing emitter of greenhouse gases, and other emerging economies.
\
The requirement that electric utilities, oil companies and large manufacturers buy allowances to emit carbon dioxide would increase the cost of producing manufactured goods since they will have to invest in a more expensive production process or purchase carbon allowances. The increased costs will result in lower production, fewer jobs and higher prices.
\
Because Michigan relies on coal-fueled power plants for 65 percent of its electricity, our state will be particularly hard hit. Manufacturing is likely to move overseas to countries that are not beset by higher environmental costs. U.S. manufacturers will face added uncertainties since the cost of emission allowances will almost surely fluctuate. As the cost of allowances rise and fall, there will be less incentive to expand or add new manufacturing facilities.
\
The effect of the carbon tax and the administration's proposal for an additional $81 billion in taxes on the electric utilities and oil and natural gas companies would be increased reliance on energy supplies from regions of the world that are unstable or unfriendly. With increasing unemployment, financial instability and uncertain political conditions in the Middle East, this is no time to boost taxes on energy production.
\
The notion of a cap-and-trade tax on carbon dioxide emissions should be shelved until sound science has provided a reasonable estimate of the net cost of manmade emissions.

80,"There's an emerging consensus that America's cities are poised for revitalization and repopulation. Arguments vary as to why this is the case: Higher gasoline prices will make suburban and exurban living too expensive, today's young people prefer urban amenities, and older, retired people seek the convenience of large cities.\These arguments ignore the disruptive effects of evolving technologies that will make driving less expensive, which will perpetuate, even expand, a suburban lifestyle. Of course, we notice higher gasoline prices because they affect us on a daily basis. But the underlying trend is toward less expensive transportation, even as the price of gasoline rises. More efficient cars, hybrid cars, and electric cars make this inevitable. These technological changes will reduce the number of cars we need, even as they encourage us to drive more and sprawl more.\But it may be the driverless car that will have the most pronounced impact on the way we live.\A family with three cars will be able to get by with two or maybe even one, depending on their work and school schedules. White-collar workers will benefit from being able to work on the way to and from their jobs, allowing them to live in distant suburbs. The car could take one spouse to work and return home for the other. For all families, getting the kid to soccer at 6 p.m. would be done automatically. The days of ordering a Zipcar from your smartphone and having it turn up at your door 15 minutes later will eventually come. The result will be more ""driving"" even as fewer people own cars.\The form of our transportation infrastructure will change. It makes more sense to send a driverless, high-efficiency car home than to pay for parking downtown. Or the car could scan for free available parking a few miles away. Parking needs for shopping will also decrease. Commercial, industrial, and office parks will occupy a smaller footprint. The result will be more compact places of employment but more sprawled residential homes.\Imagine shopping in such an environment. Delivery costs for online purchases will fall. You will be able to order something online at 11 p.m. and send your car to pick up the order. Special drive-through windows will pop up at big-box stores to facilitate such transactions. If Amazon.com wishes to stay competitive, it will have to build more warehouses to accommodate this kind of shopping.\Policy makers need to think about the implications of these transportation technologies. The ultimate conundrum is how to build and maintain the additional roads needed for a smaller pool of cars that brings in less money in gas taxes and registration fees, while also providing public transportation for the poor and that portion of the population that wishes to live in downtowns. Indeed, we see this tension being played out in southeast Michigan as we build the M-1 line to connect downtown Detroit and Midtown, while struggling to find revenues to maintain roads in the suburbs and exurbs.\There are also environmental challenges. While many tout the environmental benefits of hybrid and electric cars, we may be exchanging one environmental problem for another. Carbon emissions will be lowered, but the rural environment and habitat for wildlife will be further degraded as sprawl continues. A carbon tax will have muted effects on consumers' travel because they will be buying less gas. To protect the rural environment and to provide funding for roads, policy makers will have to start thinking about fees based on the use of roads.\The cost and time efficiencies of tomorrow's cars will make today's challenges of funding transportation infrastructure seem like a piece of cake.\Rayman Mohamed is an associate professor at Wayne State University's Department of Urban Studies and Planning"

Wind turbines, like the iconic water-cooling towers at nuclear power plants, are either objects of beauty or scars on the landscape. It depends on where you stand -- aesthetically, environmentally, economically -- and, of course, geographically.
\
Since aesthetic taste is just as personal as food preference, it makes no more sense to argue whether wind turbines are beautiful than to debate whether broccoli and brussels sprouts taste good. You either like them or you don't. With enough information about nutritional values, however, you might get used to these vegetables in your diet.
\
It's ironic that so much of the wind power debate is about what ""it looks like,"" when wind itself is invisible to the human eye. But the aesthetic arguments have come to the fore in part because more substantive grievances against wind power have lost their saliency.
\
That's why wind, along with energy efficiency, leads the way in a number of plans in the state Legislature to move Michigan into a smarter energy future that minimizes dirty and dangerous fuel sources, stabilizes and lowers electricity rates and reduces air pollutants like mercury and heat-trapping carbon dioxide.
\
First among the old arguments against wind energy is the bats and birds mortality issue. Actually, these creatures have little to worry about from well-sited wind farms compared with their other mortal enemies: buildings, house cats, high tension wires, pesticides, communication towers and vehicles.
\
And consider the nasty water and wildlife impacts from coal and nuclear plants, and the wildlife mortality from deforestation and poisoned wetlands caused by mountain top removal and other carbon-mining operations. Well-sited wind farms are not free of avian deaths, but wind wins hands down over other energy sources when it comes to animal welfare.
\
Second, we've all heard about the noise caused by wind turbines. New wind turbines are quiet. An operating modern wind farm at a distance of 750 to 1,000 feet is no noisier than a kitchen refrigerator. Since exceptions can occur in hilly terrain with downwind residences in sheltered hollows, good site standards are needed to avoid this impact.
\
Third, the standard line from our electric utilities executives is that wind turbines operate only a fraction of the time, so they would have to build as much new baseload coal or nuclear power plants anyway. Actually, wind farms built where wind blows most of the time (several Michigan locations included) will generate 30 percent to 35 percent of its rated capacity. Since no power plant generates at 100 percent ""nameplate capacity"" all of the time, utility systems always plan for excess sources.
\
The electric grid is designed to absorb many impacts -- from base-load power plants going down for repairs to industrial customers starting up energy-intensive equipment. A utility in the Northwest added 20 percent of its wind project's nameplate capacity into its baseload calculation of its Integrated Resource Plan. With wind investments, Michigan's IRP could be similarly relieved of some costs associated with building expensive new nuclear or coal-burning baseload plants.
\
Fourth, the market is speaking loudly these days and it's not talking about the old carbon and uranium based fuels. With new technologies, wind's cost has plummeted 90 percent in the past 25 years.
\
Meanwhile, rocketing costs for carbon and uranium fuels and facilities are on the threshold of squeezing out an early economic recovery in Michigan. Michigan spends about $20 billion a year to import fuel. And when (not if) Congress assesses a carbon tax and/or caps carbon emissions, Michigan's fuel costs will quickly inflate.
\
Fortunately, Michigan is a pretty windy place (about 14th in the state standings) and no other state or nation can charge us for our wind. If wind helped us save $1 billion to $2 billion a year on our energy bills, we'd be ahead in jobs, taxes and profits.
\
Finally, wind also wins hands down on the environment. Wind power has no need to mine or transport fuel, no national security issues, no climate change impacts, nothing to store, treat or dispose of, no costs of lost wages or schooldays missed from asthma attacks and no concerns about contaminating our Great Lakes for centuries to come.
\
With all its economic, environmental and public health advantages, wind turbines are looking quite pretty right now, both on the landscape and in the Legislature.

84,"WASHINGTON - New fuel economy rules for cars and trucks will be coming by the end of 2008 under a plan announced by President George W. Bush on Monday that rewrites the rules automakers had used for fighting tougher efficiency standards.\The move by Bush allowing the Environmental Protection Agency to start writing regulations aimed at greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles adds a new wrinkle to the debate in Congress over higher fuel economy standards. And it could force the U.S. auto industry to find a compromise proposal it can support wholeheartedly, rather than get caught between sides trying to outdo each other for the title of staunchest environmental defender.\One suggestion came Monday from U.S. Rep. John Dingell, who said in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club that he hopes to write a law establishing an economy-wide carbon trading system this Congress. Detroit automakers have said they would favor such a system, which allows companies to buy and swap credits that offset their emissions, but they have not backed any detailed proposal.\Bush issued an executive order Monday allowing the EPA to work with other agencies to write new regulations by the end of 2008 based on the recent Supreme Court ruling that found the government had the power to oversee carbon dioxide emissions from cars and trucks.\Bush said the ruling gave officials the power to accomplish much of his ""20 in 10"" proposal to cut U.S. gasoline demand by 20% in 2017, but he added that Congress should still put his proposal into law.\""It makes sense to do what I proposed, and we're taking action, by taking the first steps toward rules that will make our economy stronger, our environment cleaner, and our nation more secure for generations to come,"" Bush said.\Under Bush's plan, up to 8.5 billion gallons of gasoline a year would be saved through higher fuel economy standards, while alternative fuels such as ethanol would replace 35 billion gallons. To meet the efficiency goals, automakers would have to improve the fuel economy of their vehicles by 4% a year, a target they consider unreachable.\EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson told reporters that the agency would aim to produce a draft of its new rules later this year. While declining to offer any specifics of the EPA's plan, Johnson said the only ways to control greenhouse gases from vehicles is by changing fuels or fuel economy. The EPA wants Congress to pass the president's proposals because it could pre-empt legal challenges that regulations may face.\Automakers have argued that the final decisions on any increase in fuel economy standards should be left to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has to carefully consider how any increase will hurt an automaker's business. While the EPA isn't required to make its new rules tougher than NHTSA's, it also isn't required to pay as much attention to the auto industry's concerns.\Several Democrats in Congress said the Bush administration's move lacks teeth, and that Congress still needed to require higher fuel economy standards. A Senate committee approved a bill last week setting a standard of 35 miles per gallon for new cars and trucks by 2020.\""The absence of any standards in today's announcement is a reason why Americans will be looking to Congress for stronger leadership on energy policy,"" said Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.\After his speech Monday, Dingell questioned whether the Senate bill could pass the full Congress and said the Corporate Average Fuel Economy system may need to be scrapped for a different approach.\""I think it's time to move beyond what has become a stale and sterile debate over Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards,"" Dingell said. ""The auto industry today is the only industry in the country with a carbon constraint.""\While noting that a carbon tax might be more effective at reducing carbon dioxide emissions, Dingell said such a tax was not politically feasible. The Dearborn Democrat also took umbrage with a speech U.S. Sen. Barack Obama made before the economic club last week. The Democratic presidential candidate chastised the auto industry for not working harder to achieve better fuel efficiency standards.\""With all due respect, as the Sopranos would say - I would not travel to Chicago for the purpose of teaching people how to butcher hogs,"" Dingell said, drawing an enthusiastic response from the crowd.\Contact JUSTIN HYDE at 202-906-8204 or jhyde@freepress.com.\ILLUSTRATION: Photo\CAPTION: President George W.

85,"MACKINAC ISLAND -- It was a non-debate debate that kicked off the 34th annual Mackinac Policy Conference on Wednesday when U.S. Senate candidates Congressman Gary Peters, D-Bloomfield Township, and former Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land, R-Byron Center, tried to sell themselves to more than 100 people.\The candidates were not on the stage at the same time, instead, separately making their pitches and taking questions from the audience. They didn't do the traditional handshake before the audience. And they didn't pose for photos together.\But they both tailored their messages to the business-friendly audience at the event sponsored by the Detroit Regional Chamber.\Both said they support getting the federal government to pay for and build a customs plaza at the proposed New International Trade Crossing bridge between Windsor and Detroit across the Detroit River.\Both said there needs to be federal support for small-business investment, but they diverged when they talked about how that federal support should happen.\Peters talked about legislation he sponsored to get more financing options for small business, ""the heart and soul of the economy.""\Land said less federal government interference and regulation was the way to achieve a more thriving economy.\""Government overreach is hurting Michigan business,"" she said. ""The American Dream that my grandparents had is now in jeopardy.""\They differed on a number of issues and made sure the audience knew it.\""My opponent wouldn't have supported the auto bailout,"" Peters said of Land's stance on federal funding for General Motors and Chrysler.\Land noted: ""I've always supported auto workers. ... It's great that the autos are doing well. I want to go to Washington, D.C., and make sure we have a competitive environment and that they don't over-regulate and overtax.""\Land hit Peters on his vote for cap and trade on energy policy, saying he was standing with ""a billionaire radical from California, who wants cap and trade and a carbon tax,"" referring to Tom Steyer, a liberal hedge fund manager who plans on putting $100 million into influencing policies on climate change.\Peters said he wants to incentivize new technology and alternatives, such as solar and geothermal power, to deal with carbon emissions.\When it came to personal stories, both had moments to share.\Peters talked about spending his 20th anniversary Wednesday with his wife, Colleen, at the conference.\Land talked about her grandparents, immigrating from the Netherlands and starting up a hotel and trailer park. She didn't, however, talk about her husband Dan Hibma's business taking over the park, getting the residents to move out and tearing down the business to make way for redevelopment, which hasn't happened yet.\Both Land and Peters have aired ads about the trailer park and hotel.\They both also have aired ads trying to sway women to their side. Land said: ""I have always supported women, I support equal pay for equal work, always have.""\When asked about her stance on issues of importance to women, Land said she was a strong supporter of women when she was Secretary of State, and boasted of having more women managers working in the department than before she took office.\According to an exclusive poll of 600 likely Michigan voters done for the Free Press, WXYZ-TV (Channel 7) and our statewide media polling partners by EPIC-MRA of Lansing on May 17-20, Peters held a 44%-38% lead over Land with 18% undecided. And the overall margin is largely attributable to a 14-percentage-point advantage Peters had among women.\It was the first semi-joint appearance for the candidates, who both have been in the race for more than a year. Both said their experience with business -- Peters as a financial adviser before he began serving in public office and Land streamlining the work done at the SOS -- would make them a better senator to replace the retiring Carl Levin.\Contact Kathleen Gray: 517-372-8661 or kgray99@freepress.com"

87,"Congressman Mike Bishop's recent glossy mailer claiming he's ""preserving our environment"" is a laughable and flagrant attempt to obscure his poor environmental record. With a competitive election coming up, Bishop is trying to mislead his constituents into believing he has been a champion for the Great Lakes and clean air. However, his lengthy record in office tells a very different story, as too often Bishop has put big polluters over public health.\In the state legislature, Bishop earned a 20% lifetime score on the Michigan League of Conservation Voters' Legislative Scorecard, including a stunning 0% his final term. Since joining the U.S. Congress, his record has deteriorated further, dropping him to an abysmal 4% lifetime score.\In Washington, Bishop has voted repeatedly to strip away protections for clean air and clean water, which, again, isn't surprising given his record in the state legislature, where he voted against numerous attempts to provide greater protections for the Great Lakes and against Michigan's clean energy standard.\During his tenure in the U.S. Congress, Bishop has consistently voted to undermine or roll back efforts to protect the small streams and wetlands that feed into the drinking water supply of 117 million Americans. He's voted to make it harder to safeguard our waterways from pesticides, coal ash and lead. He's voted to weaken protections from smog pollution, and against efforts to protect our public lands, including voting against permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\Here in Lansing, Bishop voted to make it harder for state agencies to protect our families from pollution. He voted to gut safeguards for our wetlands, and he opposed stronger protections for the Great Lakes, including protecting our waters from invasive species. Our natural treasures, especially the Great Lakes, are essential to our way of life here in Michigan and our economy. Outdoor recreation contributes $26.6 billion to our economy and provides 232,000 good Michigan jobs.\When Bishop has had the opportunity to do the right thing for Michigan families and our environment, he has almost always chosen to side with polluters. Time after time, he has repeatedly put our economy and our health at risk. I urge Bishop's constituents to look beyond his recent spin campaign and look at his actual record.\Bishop's real record proves he's anything but our champion: from our water to our air to our public lands, Bishop has voted the wrong way again and again. How can Michigan voters trust a lawmaker who claims he's fighting for the environment when it is clear he is fighting for the polluters?\All in all, Congressman Bishop should be ashamed of his failure to protect our lakes and public health, especially while claiming he does and while taking $61,000 in campaign contributions from the oil and gas industry. Michiganders deserve better; we deserve real leadership. And Mike Bishop deserves a rendezvous with his record.\Lisa Wozniak is the executive director of Michigan League of Conservation Voters and is a nationally-recognized expert and leader in Great Lakes protections.\Lisa Wozniak\Guest columnist\USATODAY — MICH."

The following are comments on the energy bill President Bush signed into law Wednesday that would require the auto industry to average 35 miles per gallon by 2020:
\
Automakers pecked to death
\
U.S. Rep. Candice Miller, R-Harrison Township: This bill attacks the domestic auto industry because they're an easy target. It's just the weak chicken scenario, and all the other chickens in the barn yard, including the oil industry, natural gas, utilities and coal, are pecking the domestic auto industry to death, because by doing so, they can avert any sanctions against themselves.
\
And I mean that literally, since it is estimated that the cost to comply with the new corporate average fuel economy mandates are $85 billion -- $85 billion from an industry that is struggling just to survive right now, with all the unfair trade practices and legacy costs they face.
\
But instead of spending those dollars on research and development, and manufacturing vehicles that will truly reduce our addiction to foreign oil -- like lithium ion batteries, or flex fuel, or hydrogen fuel cells -- we will mandate higher CAFf standards continuing to use an antiquated approach that we started in the 1970s , the result of which has since then actually doubled our oil consumption.
\
Environment, Big 3 win
\
Hugh McDiarmid Jr. and Ariel Shaw, communications director and energy program associate with the Michigan Environmental Council in Lansing: The higher fuel economy standards in the federal energy bill will bring environmental benefits and be a buffer against rising gas prices, while protecting the domestic automobile industry from foreign competitors as it transitions into a new era.
\
This is the first increase in fuel economy standards in three decades. It will help spur development of the smart, affordable vehicles that consumers desire without requiring a second mortgage to fill their gas tanks. The standards also will curb auto emissions, which contribute unnecessarily to global warming and asthma-inducing pollution.
\
The Big Three are already well positioned to achieve the fuel economy goals with their increasingly attractive gasoline-electric hybrids and flex-fuel vehicles. They also have models being produced abroad that can meet or even exceed the new mileage requirements with modest adjustments.
\
It was a true bipartisan compromise, a massive political challenge pulled off in large part by Michigan Congressman John Dingell. His respect for conservation, paired with his loyalty to Michigan's auto industry, was essential in reaching a deal.
\
The bill's biggest weakness is the lack of a national clean energy standard -- stripped as part of political compromise -- that would have jump-started renewable power ventures and created jobs in cutting-edge industries, especially for Michigan's manufacturing economy.
\
Higher mandate is doable
\
David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor: My guess is that the more globally integrated, technically sophisticated auto company is going to be in much better shape than others and really could give it a competitive advantage. This could really separate the men from the boys, or the women from the girls.
\
Reaching 35 miles per gallon is doable. But if fuel prices fall, there could be a concern. Consumers will have less of an incentive to buy the more fuel-efficient vehicles. A generation ago, we experienced this after we said gas prices would never be cheap again. But they did. All interest in alternative technologies and alternative fuels disappeared in an instant.
\
In 1974, Congress passed the seat belt interlock rule. This was going to get people wearing seat belts. This was in place for a couple of months, and there was a public outcry. Congress decided it had made a mistake. The cost to the automakers to change this was modest. The cost for this fuel economy law if the public rebels would be much higher.
\
We are in a period of global warming hysteria. But we tend to do things that don't make sense upon further reflection. For example, cars are responsible for 10 percent of carbon dioxide in the world and 20 percent in the United States. Fuel economy rules aren't going to magically eliminate that, but it will slow it. The most important thing is develop alternative technology. The better idea is to put a contingent tax on fuel -- perhaps when oil is $40 to $50 a barrel -- to ensure the continued investment in alternative technologies, which are more likely to reduce emissions than fuel economy mandates.
\
Dangerous rule gets deadlier
\
Sam Kazman, general counsel, Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C.: One of America's deadliest regulations has just gotten deadlier. There is overwhelming evidence that, even at current levels, corporate average fuel economy (CAFf) increases traffic deaths by restricting the size and weight of vehicles. Under the energy bill signed into law Wednesday, those restrictions will, like a regulatory noose, get even tighter and even deadlier.
\
What's worse is that supporters of this law pretend that it's risk-free. In fact, CAFE is a regulatory blood-for-oil campaign, waged on civilians by policymakers too cowardly to admit what's at stake. That cowardice has been a fact of life in the last two decades of the CAFE debate. Now, that cowardice is more obvious than it's ever been before.

A team of Wayne State University researchers are working on a technology that could quickly and significantly reduce the emission of mercury and other toxic substances by power plants into the Great Lakes basin.
\
Carol Miller, Ph.D., P.E., professor of civil and environmental engineering at Wayne State University's College of Engineering, and co-Director of the Urban Watershed Environmental Research Group (UWERG) at WSU, recently received a two-year, $557,000 grant from the Great Lakes Protection Fund for the project, titled ""Real-Time Energy Impact Monitors for Residential, Industrial and Policy Use.""
\
Her team will refine, test and market a novel technology that interacts with power grids to precisely estimate the emissions associated with current power uses and signals when cleaner forms of energy are available. That technology, Locational Emissions Estimation Methodology (LEEM), was pioneered in a project previously supported by the fund.
\
LEEM gleans information from independent system operators, which operate regional power grids, to determine - in real time - the fuel sources (such as coal, natural gas, nuclear power and wind) used to generate electricity and the emissions from those sources, and then provides users the ability to reduce emissions by changing the timing of their electricity use.
\
""No matter where you are or what time of day, this technology will be able to tell you the marginal emissions associated with electricity use for car battery recharging, dishwasher use, clothes dryer cycling and other common activities,"" Miller said. ""That's important for consumers to know, because energy use and damaging emissions are not directly related. Without the information regarding real-time emissions, you might make decisions to reduce energy use at certain times in hopes of reducing polluting emissions, while actually shifting your use to a time where the emissions are more detrimental to the environment.""
\
In previous work with the fund, Miller's team developed a fully functional alpha version of LEEM and deployed it in two distinct software products: Home Emissions Read-Out (HERO) and Pollutant Emission and Pump Station Optimization (PEPSO).
\
HERO is a smart phone and web application that turns individual users into active participants in emissions optimization by giving them real-time emissions estimations that allow them to selectively time their own electricity use. PEP-SO is a software program designed to optimize pump operations at water utilities by using an existing U.S. Environmental Protection Agency hydraulic model in combination with a team-designed optimization algorithm that incorporates LEEM.
\
Miller's previous project involved designing algorithms that automatically direct pumps to operate at times when the electric power grid is supplied by the cleanest available sources of energy, and avoid times when it is supplied by more polluting sources. The software was pilot tested using the DWSD water distribution system.
\
The current project will explore the potential for embedding LEEM technology into ""smart"" appliances and building systems, integrating it into the electric vehicle market, and working with regulators to incorporate it into energy standards and programs. Miller's team will refine and pilot the LEEM technology, research the market with help from manufacturers and trade organizations, engage customers, and develop a marketing strategy for large-scale adoption of the technology. If successful, the future will see LEEM embedded in a suite of products and services.
\
""This technology focuses on demand-side management of energy usage and puts choices in the hands of consumers,"" Miller said. ""Even if you don't have an interest in the environment per se, businesses and water utilities can still use LEEM to be savvier about their emissions because of potential future regulations. And for individual consumers, some big home electricity uses - such as charging electric cars - are coming online very soon.""
\
Miller said the project's environmental benefits could be felt in the very near future around the eight-state Great Lakes region, with possible expansion of the methodology to the rest of the United States and Canada.

Commuting edge is real

Derek Melot (April 6 column) is right: The Lansing area has a great advantage to promote in its commuter-friendly environment.
\
In 2007, my husband and I moved here from the Washington, D.C., area. We went from living 25 miles away from our jobs (in opposite directions) to living one-half mile from mine, and zero miles for his. (He telecommutes to his job back in Maryland.)
\
The D.C. area has the third worst commute in the nation. My 25-mile commute could take 35 minutes or two hours. You just never knew.
\
It has been a delight to move to the Greater Lansing area, to enjoy short drives, to be able to ride my bike, to walk to downtown East Lansing and Michigan State University. It has improved our quality of life dramatically.
\
Too many people sell our region short. We have so much to offer, so much the hassled folks of the East Coast would be happy to enjoy, if they could find work here.

Let's let the world know that living here is great!

Church hasn't learned
\
The Roman Catholic Church priesthood never seems to learn the biblical lesson of Numbers 32:23, which says, ""... and you may be sure that your sin will find you out.""
\
They just keep on sinning.
\
Raniero Cantalamessa, Pope Benedict XVI's personal preacher, likened the tide of allegations that the pontiff has covered up sex abuse cases to the ""more shameful aspects of anti-Semitism."" This ignorant statement not only offends Jewish people, but shamefully abuses a second time the innocent victims.
\
Over centuries, countless hundreds of thousands (millions?) of both boys and girls have been sexually and physically abused by evil priests. Cowardly superiors, including popes and cardinals, then employed a lie-and-deny strategy to cover it all up.
\
Priests were simply transferred to a new church, where they continued to molest children. How truly unforgettably shameful is this Satanic sin.
\
Parents, please know what happens when a priest, minister or school teacher spends his or her time with your children. Love them enough to protect them, for one day, you'll give an account before God.

Odd form of 'patriotism'
\
I find it interesting that while President Bush insisted we send billions of our dollars each month to Iraq (a little country most can't find on a map), the Tea-Party types, apparently believing it was a good place to spend our money, responded enthusiastically.
\
Many of these ""patriots"" have continued to show favor to other countries' economies by buying foreign cars.
\
Now, President Obama has decided taxpayer money should instead be invested here to repair our economy from the devastation wrought by unwise executive leadership, banking deregulation and the most bloated deficit in the history of the U.S.
\
Oddly, the same people who believed the costly invasion of Iraq was a prudent investment are howling about their money being spent here in America!
\
It seems that blindly dedicating one's allegiance to a group, and having fun shouting and waving signs, can sometimes be a symptom of a serious lack of logical thinking and patriotic insight.

Target energy jobs
\
With one of the highest rates of unemployment in the country, Michigan can use all the help it can get in the creation of jobs.
\
Investing in the expansion of energy efficiency could create new and important work for Michigan residents. Many homes and business need to be upgraded for greater energy efficiency. This will provide a window of opportunity for many industries to generate new opportunities for residents desperately in need of employment.
\
We need to put money back into our own community and keep it here and an excellent way to do this is by expanding Michigan's energy efficiency standard.

Walking Weimar's path

I think those Democrats who voted for the so-called health-care reform bill showed their level of intelligence.

Rep. Bart Stupak is a good example. Take the ""ak"" from his name and insert ""id"" and you have him right in there with the rest of the state Democrats like Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Carl Levin and Gov. Jennifer Granholm and the other Democratic representatives who supported this unconstitutional travesty, which demeans and destroys the 10th Amendment, thus leading to the destruction of the First and Second Amendments.
\
This piece of trash will be an overwhelming financial burden. The estimate of the Congressional Budget Office is not borne up by the history of the CBO. For example, Medicare costs 20 times their initial estimate. They have been profoundly wrong in all their estimates.

Then, tell me why is evolution, which, if you look at the data, is a scientific theory, at best, being taught as fact? Not only is this being taught as fact, it is the only option being taught. In my opinion, there's more evidence for creationist theory than evolution.

93,"LANSING – Senate Republicans began moving the 2020 budget Tuesday, with no part of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's proposed 45-cent gas tax increase included.\It's a not unexpected setback for Whitmer's plan to ""fix the damn roads"" — one that could also impact her plans to significantly boost spending on education and environmental improvements.\The governor's office said Tuesday that Whitmer is prepared to work with lawmakers, but she will veto the bill if it reaches her desk in its current form.\It ""won't do anything to actually fix the roads, and could actually make things worse,"" said Whitmer spokeswoman Tiffany Brown.\In a party line, 5-2 vote, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation reported out the roads budget after axing Whitmer's ""Fixing Michigan Roads Program,"" which is proposed to eventually raise another $1.9 billion a year to fix the roads, of which a little more than $900 million would be available in 2020.\Republicans on the committee said they're doing the responsible thing by proposing a balanced budget based on revenues the state now has. Any possible future revenue should be part of a discussion later this year, said the chairman, Sen. Wayne Schmidt, R-Traverse City.\""That's the future,"" Schmidt said of any possible tax increase for roads. ""We know what we have today.""\A Democrat on the committee, Sen. Rosemary Bayer, D-Beverly Hills, accused Republicans of cowardice.\""They're being chicken,"" Bayer said after the meeting. ""They're taking the cowardly way out.""\Schmidt said he wants to continue to work with a $1.2-billion road funding package that was signed into law in 2015, and he's not clear on how much additional road funding money Michigan needs. He said the bill reported out by the committee actually accelerates the 2015 road funding package by one year, by allocating a full $600 million of general fund money to roads in 2020 — up from $450 million in the original plan.\Jeff Cranson, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Transportation, said he's encouraged by lawmakers' commitments to further discussions.\""We still like the governor's plan,"" Cranson said. ""We think it does the best job of getting the most pavement to the best condition in the shortest amount of time.""\Whitmer and department director Paul Ajegba will continue to hold town hall meetings and ""keep taking the case to the people,"" he said.\The road funding piece of the budget has ramifications for school spending and the environment, because by raising more fuel tax money to spend on roads, Whitmer wants to stop spending general fund money on roads, instead targeting that money items such as education and improving drinking water quality.\The bill, Senate Bill 149, now goes to the full Senate Appropriations Committee for consideration. Budget considerations in the state House are not advanced as far as they are in the Senate.\Michigan's gas tax is currently 26.3 cents per gallon for both regular and diesel fuel. Whitmer's proposed three-step increase over a one-year period would give Michigan the highest fuel taxes in the country.\Ohio recently voted to increase fuel taxes by 10.5 cents per gallon for regular fuel and by 19 cents per gallon for diesel fuel, effective July 1.\Though the Michigan plan would raise $2.5 billion a year in new funding, the net increase for roads would be $1.9 billion, after backing out the general fund money now devoted to roads.\Contact Paul Egan: 517-372-8660 or pegan@freepress.com.

TRAVERSE CITY -- Ford Motor Co. CEO Alan Mulally called the federal government's mandatory fuel economy requirements a failed program and suggested a tax on gasoline might do more to achieve energy independence and help the environment.
\
Ford is committed to improving fuel efficiency, reducing dependence on foreign oil and protecting the environment, but the nation must take a broader approach to addressing these challenges that involves consumers as well as manufacturers, Mulally said Wednesday at the auto industry's annual Management Briefing Seminars.
\
""We also have to do it in a rational way so that we don't destroy a phenomenal manufacturing industry,"" he said to loud applause from industry leaders. ""The way to get at it is to make an economic decision like they do in Europe... our behavior would change dramatically.""
\
Europe has a higher fleetwide fuel economy average than the U.S., in part because of high gas taxes.
\
Mulally said U.S. Rep. John Dingell's recent proposal of a 50-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline is an option worth considering, though he later told reporters he was ""not necessarily"" endorsing a tax on fuel.
\
""I just think it's so important that we all join in this debate and we really decide what we want to do about energy security and global warming,"" Mulally said ""A piece of that could be a tax.""
\
Mulally said Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards have done tremendous damage to the U.S. auto industry, without freeing the nation from its dependence on foreign oil or minimizing global warming.
\
""I have never seen a market-distorting policy like CAFE,"" Mulally said. ""It's a policy that forces you to put out more small cars than there is consumer demand for to make the bigger cars that people really do want. You're trying to force the market instead of being market-driven.""
\
Speaking with The Detroit News later, Mulally said he was surprised by the attention his remarks sparked, but said he felt it is important to start a discussion, as Dingell has done with his proposal.
\
""We're going to be right in the middle of that debate,"" he said.
\
When the CAFE standards were first created in 1975, the United States imported 28 percent of its oil, Mulally said. As a result of the policy, automakers improved fuel economy by nearly 100 percent and fuel prices went down. That encouraged consumers to buy more cars and drive more.
\
""We have three times the number of cars that we had then and we drive four times the number of miles,"" Mulally said, adding that the United States now imports 68 percent of its oil. ""So how did that policy work?""
\
Mulally said more stringent CAFE standards being proposed in Washington today will only compound the problem. But he also said the industry has to do more than oppose new regulations. It has to offer novel solutions.
\
""It's really important that the automobile industry start talking about what they stand for, and not what they stand against,"" he said. ""We absolutely believe in fuel efficiency, we absolutely believe in energy independence and security, and we absolutely believe in being good stewards of the environment. And we ought to be improving our fuel efficiency every year forever on every vehicle.""
\
Congress is pushing for tougher CAFE standards, forcing the auto industry onto the defensive.
\
""We've faced regulatory threats before, but never the tidal wave heading our way (now),"" Jim Lentz, U.S. sales chief for Toyota Motor Corp., said Wednesday.
\
As a result, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the industry organization that represents Detroit automakers, Toyota and others, has endorsed legislation that would raise CAFE standards.
\
In an effort to beat back a Senate proposal that would raise fleetwide fuel economy 40 percent by 2020 to a standard of 35 miles per gallon for cars and trucks combined, automakers have grudgingly embraced an alternative in the House that would still include a hefty increase.
\
The Hill-Terry bill would raise light truck fuel economy to at least 32 miles per gallon by 2022 and to 35 mpg for passenger cars by 2022. The proposal has garnered more than 160 House cosponsors and helped dissuade House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from bringing up a fuel economy increase before the August recess.
\
Ford has separately endorsed the Hill-Terry bill and Mulally reiterated his support for that approach Wednesday.
\
Dave McCurdy, president of the automobile alliance, expressed concern Wednesday that criticism of CAFE could muddy his organization's message to lawmakers. But many in Traverse City agreed with Mulally's comments about CAFE.
\
""It's push with no pull,"" said David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research and the master of ceremonies at the annual industry confab. ""There's no incentive for the consumer.""
\
Other automakers reacted cautiously to Mulally's comments.
\
""We've also said energy policies must consider the consumer but we've never specifically advocated a gas tax,"" said General Motors Corp. spokesman Greg Martin. ""We're an automaker and we believe its best that issues involving consumer tax reside with policy makers. We're going to reserve comment until the policy discussion is much further along.""
\
However, Chrysler Corp. said a gasoline tax is worth considering.
\
""We think that should be part of the debate,"" said John Bozzella, vice president of external affairs and public policy for Chrysler. His company favors a three-pronged approach that includes improved vehicle technology, increased use of alternative fuels and changes in consumer behavior. Bozzella said raising the price of fuel could be one way to do that.
\
Even McCurdy agreed that a gas tax is a fair and direct way to make drivers responsible for the fuel they consume, though he said it remains a political impossibility.
\
""Neither party is going to support a major tax bill like that,"" he said. ""There might be some intellectual support, but not the political support.""

The Detroit News is on the right track. Changing costs is what we must do to change our habits.
\
The United States should create a mandatory $1.50-a-gallon gas and diesel fuel tax increase that would rise 50 cents a year over seven years. It would finance a Justified Energy Development Initiative fund, with money going to support mass transit systems; highway and railroad infrastructure improvement; consumers hurt by the cost shift; and initiatives like redeveloping urban areas.

Tax hike would kill state
\
Is The Detroit News editorial board out of its gourd urging Congress to add a $1-a-gallon gas tax? It would kill the already troubled Michigan economy. Tourism would suffer. Auto sales would decrease. And the nation would fall into a major depression.

Tax devalues Explorers
\
Unless someone plans on building viable mass transit here in Metro Detroit, we would just be throwing more money in the gas tank with nothing to show for it.
\
Furthermore, if I need to sell my 2000 Explorer because I can't afford the extra $100 gas tax a month, will The Detroit News editorial team buy it from me? With gas at $4 a gallon, who would want it?

Tax hike curtails freedom
\
I pray to God that The News' editorial staff has its collective tongue firmly planted in its collective cheek. I am not willing to sacrifice the liberty and freedom of our nation simply to have better fuel economy. We are not Western Europe with its nanny state mentality.
\
We do not need to be punished to save energy. Open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and begin drilling off our coasts -- it can be done in a green and environment friendly way. Allow power companies to build more nuclear and other power generation plants. Ease restrictions on the construction of oil refineries.

Put $1 tax on papers, too
\
Based on The News' $1 gallon gas tax idea, this suggestion also will make sense. Place a $1 per issue tax on all newspapers. This would immediately cause a massive decrease in the amount of paper produced, resulting in a dramatic decrease in natural gas usage at paper plants, reductions in water treatment of sludge produced in paper plants and reduced needs for harvest of trees for lumber and pulp. This would leave more trees standing and allow a greater carbon consumption (by the trees).

Tax would kill industries
\
If The News wants to devastate the recreational vehicle, boating, and tourism industries, then go ahead and push its $1-per-gallon gas tax increase. If you wish to increase the costs of virtually everything we Americans hold dear -- our food, clothing, and all consumer goods needing transportation -- continue writing editorials like the April 25th piece. Some brilliant politician is probably contemplating how to spend the new windfall already.

Tax increase cuts demand
\
Anyone serious about reducing fuel usage would support an increased per gallon fuel tax. Car companies build the vehicles people want or go out of business, so more fuel-efficient vehicles would result. It would also reduce the miles driven in the current vehicle fleet.
\
While increased fuel tax is the fastest and best way to reduce fuel usage, as shown in Europe, it will get no support. This may not be a bad thing, as forced reduction in fuel use does have negative economic implications.

Mass transit trumps gas tax
\
The News' ""idea"" that Congress should raise gasoline prices a dollar to curb oil consumption does not explain why Europeans and the Japanese are able to get by without the automobile. Their people drive less because they have developed mass transit systems that work. America built its infrastructure around the car, not walking or riding a horse or bike. If you think Michigan's economy is bad now, then wait until this is passed and signed into law.

Gas tax fuels pork
\
I can afford a $1 gas tax, but I know a lot of people who can't. Is $140 billion for Washington a license to steal as in ""pork""? The automakers wouldn't get a sniff.

\
Let the market work
\
We already have a mechanism that takes care of consumption called the price mechanism of supply and demand. We're seeing it already in action. All gas taxes do is put more money in the coffers of governments, which will spend it like a drunken sailor on whatever pet projects.
\
In addition, you would be crippling working families who are forced farther and farther out in the suburbs to find affordable housing. Let the invisible hand work. The market will have consumers make their choices, find their substitutes, and stimulate the creation of alternatives to oil.

96,"LANSING – Senate Republicans began moving the 2020 budget Tuesday, with no part of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's proposed 45-cent gas tax increase included.\It's not an unexpected setback for Whitmer's plan to ""fix the damn roads"" — one that could also impact her plans to significantly boost spending on education and environmental improvements.\The governor's office said Tuesday that Whitmer is prepared to work with lawmakers, but she will veto the bill if it reaches her desk in its current form.\It ""won't do anything to actually fix the roads, and could actually make things worse,"" said Whitmer spokeswoman Tiffany Brown.\In a party line, 5-2 vote, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation reported out the roads budget after axing Whitmer's ""Fixing Michigan Roads Program,"" which is proposed to eventually raise another $1.9billion a year to fix the roads, of which a little more than $900million would be available in 2020.\Republicans on the committee said they're doing the responsible thing by proposing a balanced budget based on revenues the state now has. Any possible future revenue should be part of a discussion later this year, said the chairman, Sen. Wayne Schmidt, R-Traverse City.\""That's the future,"" Schmidt said of any possible tax increase for roads. ""We know what we have today.""\A Democrat on the committee, Sen. Rosemary Bayer, D-Beverly Hills, accused Republicans of cowardice.\""They're being chicken,"" Bayer said after the meeting. ""They're taking the cowardly way out.""\Schmidt said he wants to continue to work with a $1.2billion road funding package that was signed into law in 2015, and he's not clear on how much additional road funding money Michigan needs.\He said the bill reported out by the committee actually accelerates the 2015 road funding package by one year, by allocating a full $600 million of general fund money to roads in 2020 — up from $450million in the original plan.\Jeff Cranson, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Transportation, said he's encouraged by lawmakers' commitments to further discussions.\""We still like the governor's plan,"" Cranson said. ""We think it does the best job of getting the most pavement to the best condition in the shortest amount of time.""\Whitmer and department director Paul Ajegba will continue to hold town hall meetings and ""keep taking the case to the people,"" he said.\The road funding piece of the budget has ramifications for school spending and the environment, because by raising more fuel tax money to spend on roads, Whitmer wants to stop spending general fund money on roads, instead targeting that money items such as education and improving drinking water quality.\The bill, Senate Bill 149, now goes to the full Senate Appropriations Committee for consideration.\Budget considerations in the state House are not advanced as far as they are in the Senate.\Michigan's gas tax is currently 26.3 cents per gallon for both regular and diesel fuel. Whitmer's proposed three-step increase over a one-year period would give Michigan the highest fuel taxes in the country.\Ohio recently voted to increase fuel taxes by 10.5 cents per gallon for regular fuel and by 19 cents per gallon for diesel fuel, effective July 1.\Though the Michigan plan would raise $2.5billion a year in new funding, the net increase for roads would be $1.9billion, after backing out the general fund money now devoted to roads.\CREDIT: Paul Egan"

No gas tax increase
\
So the CEO of General Motors wants the federal government to increase the gas tax as much as $l a gallon (""GM's chief pushing for higher gas taxes,"" June 7). Dan Akerson is suggesting this under the guise that it is good for the environment and GM will be better able to meet the government's fuel economy requirements. This would kill any growth in the economy and increase the burden on the marginal wage earners and elderly. Let GM sell cars on their merit. Stay out of the tax issues, as the federal government is quite capable of increasing taxes on its own.
\
Jim Ford, Clarkston
\
Hey GM, no thanks
\
GM CEO Dan Akerson seemed comfortable talking about increasing the gasoline tax and how it's seemingly OK for taxpayers to lose out on the government's investment in GM to the tune of $12 billion (""GM's chief pushing for higher gas taxes,"" June 7). He then went on to stump for Barack Obama's re-election. Can you say crony capitalism?

\
Fuel poll unfair
\
Recently a consumer advocacy group claimed that a sampling of Americans they polled on increasing fuel efficiency support said proposals (""Study: Fuel rules to hike car costs,"" June 15). I am confident that if those who were polled were informed about the consequences of extreme fuel economy demands, they would not be enthusiastic about 56-miles-per-gallon rules. Those who advocate such mandates will proclaim the world is coming to an end from global warming. That still doesn't justify deceiving people regarding the cost we may have to pay for ever more draconian fuel economy requirements.

Minicar pricing problem

Why would anyone spend nearly $15,000 for a subcompact Sonic when for a $1,000 more you could have a bigger vehicle that I consider more of a real car (""Chevy's subcompact Sonic to sell for $14,495,"" June 18)? Once again GM shows why it has never been a price leader except in discounting through rebates its overpriced vehicles.

98,"On Chrysler's financial condition\CEO Bob Nardelli: ""I'd like to just spend a minute to talk about the health of Chrysler. When we became private last August, there was a pro forma presented to our investors. If you look at 2007, we met or exceeded every one of those metrics from top to bottom. We said publicly, Cerberus said publicly, we ended the year with $1 billion more cash than planned. And, again, closed out, we think, very strongly. We put together what I'll call a very aggressive conservative plan for 2008 - guarded but optimistic. And through the first quarter we met our plan and again exceeded cash. ...\""We're not where we want to be over the long haul. But we are exactly on plan or better relative to our return to profitability. And I think that is an important message, certainly to our employees, the million people who are counting on Chrysler for success. It's important for those million people, it's important for the auto industry, it's important for Detroit that Chrysler succeed. And I would hope we are all focused on helping Chrysler succeed. We are not as bad as people write about. We maybe were never as good as was written about it. But we are on the road to recovery.""\On gas prices and a proposal to suspend the gas tax for the summer\President Jim Press: ""You have to have alignment between what is best for the country long term and our energy policy and consumer motivation. ... If we have these [fuel economy] regulations and we have to produce vehicles that have to conform in certain ways to what we need, the customer's motivation should be based on the same metric. When you start doing things like that temporarily, like the gas tax, I think it has ramifications on distorting what the true market is.""\Nardelli: ""If you really stop and you look at this in a broader view, and you want to address it from the standpoint of energy and oil independence, if you want to address it from the standpoint of the environment, and then the third point in my mind, if you want to address it from the economy, you might suggest that a fuel tax along with a federal incentive to a consumer, in the form of a rebate to buy a more fuel-efficient vehicle, helps the energy. It certainly helps on the CO2. And, oh, by the way, if the incentive is on domestic-produced vehicles, certainly like the hybrids we have coming out this fall, then you certainly touch the third leg of the stool - the economy.""\Press: ""It isn't just the cost of fuel. You know, a piece of the polar ice cap the size of Rhode Island just disappeared in six weeks. And so it seems funny, if that is really an issue of mammoth, mankind size, why for the summer does it not matter?""\On the U.S. economy\Nardelli: ""If you look at any time there has been an oil shock, there has been an adjustment in the system. We all knew the country was a little overheated. Having come out of that industry [as CEO at Home Depot], I can tell you I enjoyed six, seven years of unprecedented levels of housing starts. Now they are at a 19-year low heading towards maybe World War II levels ... tremendous contraction.\""I think the country really missed the impact of the Bear Stearns deal. It happened so quick it was kind of a blip. That is a real troubling issue I think when you look at the overall economic health.\""We're not projecting a stronger second half. And if those people out there do project it, you'd like to ask them the second question: Based on what? We don't see 2008 different than when we started. Quite honestly, unless we see something in the short term that would have a significant impact on 2009, we're going to be very conservative - guarded but optimistic - in our view for 2009.""\On buyouts\President Tom LaSorda: ""Three-quarters of it is pretty much completed. We still have more to do by the end of the year. We have about a 78% acceptance rate towards the plan. ...\""Now, it's the movement of people and then taking them from people who may not have accepted but now have to go replace somebody. So, I would say we have never missed a reduction plan target, so I would not expect that we would miss this one, either.""\On learning the industry\Nardelli: ""I've moved 14 times in my career, and I've been in a lot of different businesses, from tungsten ore mines to aircraft engines to medical to locomotive to construction equipment, so I've really been fortunate to have experienced a lot of different businesses in a lot of different sectors.\""I would say about 70-75% of what we all do is pretty portable. I think the other 30% is you have to be a dry sponge and you have to put yourself in the bucket and absorb as much as you can as fast as you can. ...\""I think the uniqueness here is, Jim and I will huddle and we'll get on our BlackBerry and say, 'What did we sell last hour?' Then we'll get in a room and say, 'What in the hell are we going to design in 2015?' So, the scope of this job is a real learning experience.""\ILLUSTRATION: Photo\CAPTION: Chrysler Chief Executive Officer Bob Nardelli answers a question Thursday during an interview with Free Press reporters and editors.

99,"Now that the voting is done, a blue wave has washed over the federal government with the Democrats controlling Congress, though by a narrow majority, and occupying the White House.\The change is expected to have far reaching implications on the car business. For example, with less than two weeks in the White House, President Joe Biden has made it clear that climate change is at the top of his agenda.\He has plans to address regulations on tailpipe emissions and fuel economy and he wants more battery-electric vehicles — along with the infrastructure to support them — on U.S. roads. Biden wants to have 500,000 EV charging stations across the nation, about 20 times more than currently exist.\Biden also has called for government vehicle fleets to be electric.\Fortunately, most automakers have spent years preparing for an increasingly stiffer set of regulations, ultimately leading to a future with more electric vehicles.\But a key part of Biden's campaign platform has been tax reform, which carries unknown implications for corporate and consumer taxes, both of which could affect carmakers and their customers.\The Biden administration will also face sorting out trade issues, which could potentially lower automakers' raw material costs.\""The Biden administration will be impacting the auto industry in a massive number of ways: from safety to trade to technology to the environment,"" Paul Eisenstein, publisher of automotive website The Detroit Bureau, said. ""Virtually everything the industry could imagine being impacted by the government could see significant changes as a result of the Biden agenda.""\To gas tax or not to gas tax\A key part of advancing the automakers' move into EVs might hang on how ""Mayor Pete"" finds funding for U.S. roads and other infrastructure.\Secretary of Transportation nominee Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and a former presidential candidate, will face the challenge of increasing the dwindling Federal Highway Fund, which currently relies largely on the gas tax to pay for U.S. roads, if he is confirmed.\""Depending on how the government solves the gas tax issue, it could impact EV development in several ways: If you have an EV now and charge it at home, you're getting a free ride and not contributing to the Federal Highway Fund,"" Eisenstein said. ""There may be a number of ways the government looks at restructuring taxes and you might pay a tax by the kilowatt hour. That might make owning an EV a little less attractive in energy cost savings.""\Such a move would face opposition from automakers, many of whom are investing billions of dollars to transition their lineup to an all-electric future, he said.\The Federal Highway Fund is largely funded by the 18.4-cents-per-gallon gas tax that people pay. That's been frozen since 1993.\As vehicles have grown increasingly fuel efficient to meet government fuel economy standards, they run on less gas. So fewer trips to the pump mean less tax to fill the fund.\During Buttigieg's confirmation hearing last week, when asked about raising taxes to pay for infrastructure improvements, Buttigieg said there are a variety of ways to address the highway fund shortfall, which ""in the short to medium term ... could include revisiting the gas tax, adjusting it and or connecting it to inflation.""\A spokesman for Buttigieg later said that a variety of options are on the table, ""but increasing the gas tax is not among them.""\While the auto industry has no say in how the fund gets replenished, analysts say carmakers are likely watching very closely what happens to the gas tax.\The wild card\Biden's call to buy American, his push for rapid adoption of EVs and his plan to rebuild the conventional transportation infrastructure and auto industry as part of a $2 trillion-plus spending plan will mostly benefit General Motors and Ford Motor Co. Both automakers are investing in bringing more electric cars to market going forward, with GM aspiring to have all its light-duty new vehicles be electric by 2035. Stellantis also has plans in the works for an EV future.\Even the start-ups and Tesla's of the world will see growing demand for their electric cars if Biden can convince Congress to go along.\His proposed $2 trillion investment would create ""millions of good, union jobs rebuilding America's crumbling infrastructure — from roads and bridges to green spaces and water systems to electricity grids and universal broadband,"" according to Biden's clean-energy proposal. It would lay the foundation for the United States to compete globally and ""withstand the impacts of climate change, and improve public health,"" the plan said.\Specific to the auto industry, Biden promises his plan will create 1 million new jobs across the U.S. car business and pay for EV charging stations.\Of course Congress must approve any spending and with a Senate that's evenly split between Democrats and Republicans — with Vice President Kamala Harris, as the titular president of the Senate, able to break ties — that could be difficult.\The Trump administration had a Republican -controlled Congress for the first two years of Donald Trump's term, yet his infrastructure proposals never get off the ground. Biden winning approval will take compromise that has been lacking in recent sessions.\Cox Automotive Chief Economist Jonathan Smoke said during an early January Cox Automotive Industry Insights 2021 webcast that Biden's infrastructure spending plan, if passed by Congress, will help accelerate consumer adoption of EVs.\Expect both spending and economic growth to be larger in 2021, ""than otherwise would have happened,"" Smoke said. And look for future emissions and fuel economy regulations to stiffen under Biden, he said.\Spending and economic growth have ""two elements related to automotive: the environment and consumer financial protection,"" Smoke said. ""The former will hasten the move to electrification that manufacturers already want to see. ... The latter could have consequences that keep credit tight and together with inflation make affordability even more challenging.""\Smoke said the biggest unknown to the car business is Biden's push for tax reform and the implications it could have on corporate taxes and consumers in the luxury car segment.\""Like regulation, tax reform likely won't spoil the party in 2021,"" Smoke said. ""But it will be a wild card to follow.""\Taking on Trump\The Biden administration is set on reversing the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards enacted by the Trump administration.\It remains to be seen if Biden can and will act through an executive order to reinstate former President Barack Obama's stricter standards or seek a compromise, Eisenstein said.\Under the Obama administration requirements, the fleet of new vehicles would have to average 30 mpg in real-world driving by 2021, rising to 36 mpg in 2025. Currently, the standard is 26 mpg. The Trump administration proposed freezing the standards at 2021 levels through 2025.\But Biden will likely have a hard time quickly changing CAFE standards that are already in place, said Stephanie Brinley, principal analyst for IHS Markit. Changing a rule like that the Trump administration put in place to roll back fuel standards can be an involved process that takes months or years and is more complicated than an executive order.\""I haven't heard a specific statement from the Biden administration about what they plan to do with the forward regulations, but it seems to me to be an obvious opportunity,"" Brinley said. ""There's a lot of back and forth on this and it does not move quickly, so for the Biden administration to set new fuel economy regulations would take them a couple of years anyway. It's more an opportunity to take"" for the future.\Biden also has to address the Trump administration's move to eliminate the California waiver. The Trump administration is in a lawsuit over whether California has the right to set its own greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy standards. The auto industry is split on that and many such as Ford, GM and Volkswagen want a compromise.\""Whatever the administration does, it will take into account California's push for more EVs, high fuel economy and lower emissions,"" Eisenstein said. ""That is no surprise. Biden has indicated he favors EVs. Whether he can get a divided Congress to agree to some of the elements — such as 500,000 charging stations and increasing incentives to EV buyers — remains to be seen.""\Beyond taking on Trump's CAFE and emissions battles, Biden will likely reconsider some of the import and export changes made during Trump's revamping of trade.\""We've seen a slump of U.S. vehicles being exported, especially to China, as a result of the mishandled trade war,"" Eisenstein said. ""Raw materials have been impacted as a result of the Trump trade war. That's going to be a real challenge with the Biden administration.""\Also the pandemic has hurt automaker production and led to parts shortages, which for Ford has resulted in having to idle some of its factories. The Biden administration must orchestrate an effective plan for mass distribution of the vaccine to get the pandemic controlled and auto production ramped up.\Rivian in Yosemite?\Then there is Biden's Buy American agenda. On Monday, Biden said he plans to replace the U.S. government's fleet of roughly 650,000 vehicles with electric models.\He also criticized existing rules that allow government-bought vehicles to be considered U.S.-made even if they contain many components not made here. Biden vowed to close loopholes that allow parts such as engines, steel and glass to be made abroad.\But Biden's ""Buy America"" executive order signed Monday does not direct the purchase of electric vehicles. In fact, a fleet of government EVs likely won't make a big dent in the auto industry, Brinley said.\""It's not going to be Rivian trucks suddenly patrolling Yosemite Park,"" Brinley said. ""They don't have the volume. So, it's good to plant the seed, but he's a little ahead of what automakers can supply.""\And price attractively. She noted that an internal combustion gasoline Ford F-series pickup might cost about $40,000 compared with a pickup by electric truck maker Rivian that costs about $85,000 or the 2022 GMC Hummer EV pickup priced at over $100,000.\What's most important, Brinley said, ""is the trajectory that Biden is putting in place ... that this is where we want to go. But Congress has to approve it and the vehicles have to be available at the price point that the government can afford.""\Staff writer Todd Spangler contributed to this report.\Contact Jamie L.

Voices from Lansing: Detroit delegation lists its agenda.
\
Edited and complied by Robert E. McTyre
\
Some of the most innovative ideas involving Detroit's economic recovery are coming from a consistently resilient and creative faction in the state Legislature -- the Detroit delegation. These lawmakers represent a diversity of thought and background, and are powerful voices of persuasion for issues that are in the best interest of Detroit.
\
Presented here is a lengthy -- though not complete -- list of these legislators and highlights of their responses to what they believe are the top five priority issues relevant to Detroit's economic recovery. Their responses are presented in their own words.
\
Sen. Joe Young Jr. 1st District
\
Born in Detroit in 1950, Joe Young Jr. was elected to the Michigan House in 1978 where he served for eight terms. Now a state senator, Young is a member of the following committees: Families, Mental Health & Human Services; Judiciary, Local Urban & State Affairs.
\
Youth Initiatives: By creating a Michigan Peace Corps, establishing a statewide youth commission and establishing recreational programs for youth, we will go a long way toward encouraging and producing constructive, productive youth. It is not until we provide such positive options that we can expect our leaders of tomorrow to be better prepared.
\
A 'Detroit only lottery': Amid constant pressure from the Detroit community, the Bureau of State Lottery has failed to adequately address our questions and concerns.
\
These range from the selection of the numbers, the proportion of ticket sales sold by geographic region and the disproportionate number of winners from the same area.
\
By creating a ""Detroit Only Lottery,"" the community could ensure that their dollars and prizes not only go to Detroiters, but that Detroit will be able to exercise self-determination through spending lottery revenues on needed priorities.
\
Protection, preservation of property: I have a package of legislation which strikes at the heart of many of our neighborhood concerns, the use and re-use of property.
\
Under Senate Bill 219, which has passed the Senate and is before the House for further action, homeowners have the right to take their neighbor(s) to court to have that particular neighbor's land and property cleaned up.
\
The other bills include providing for the cleanup of vacant property and provide strict penalties for littering on vacant property.
\
Establishment of a Black Affairs Commission: All too often, issues, concerns, events and pieces of history which stand to substantially impact the lives of our community are fragmented and partial.
\
By creating a Black Affairs Commission we would have a round table opportunity to identify our needs and develop a unified strategy for problem solving. Until such time as a clear consistent voice for our issues and concerns are created, remedies will be incomplete.
\
A Black Affairs Commission's role would follow along the lines of the already established Commission on Spanish Speaking Affairs, the Indian Affairs Commission and the Michigan Women's Commission.
\
Allowing for mail order prescriptions: I have introduced Senate Bill 448 which would allow Michigan-based companies to participate in the mail order prescription business.
\
As the law is currently written, employers in Michigan who offer mail order prescription services for their employees must contract with an out-of-state business.
\
I believe that by allowing these companies to be in Michigan, we will be encouraging business development as well as promoting Michigan-based services.
\
This would also create employment opportunities whereby individuals can not only support a family but also support a retirement plan as well.
\
Sen. Jackie Vaughn III 4th District
\
Jackie Vaughn III graduated from Oxford University with an Oxon B. Litt. He is a two-term past president of the Michigan Young Democrats and past president protempore of the Michigan Senate. Over the years he has held several other distinguished posts.
\
Urban educational opportunities: Specifically, funding and support for Highland Park Community College and Wayne State University. I fought for the successful reinstatement of Highland Park Community College into the higher education budget and I support an appropriations increase of 6 percent for Wayne State.
\
Michigan Nursing Opportunity Act: The act provides scholarship money to nursing students who are under-represented minorities in the nursing profession. The act is designed to increase the number of minorities working in health care and subsequently provide greater access to health care in areas with high minority populations.
\
Casino gambling: This issue, while controversial, could provide Detroit and other urban areas with an important economic base to supplement other business and industrial activity.
\
Considering the very successful introduction of casino gambling in Windsor, it would appear that Detroit would do well to add casino gambling to its list of attractions.
\
Gas tax: While no legislation has yet been introduced on the subject, the governor has discussed it as an option.
\
At this point there is a great deal of debate about how any revenues from this tax would be divided between local units of government. However, it seems clear that such a tax would provide Detroit and other urban areas with the funding necessary to make the infrastructure improvements (to roads, bridges, etc.) that are vital to economic growth.
\
Empowerment Zones: Detroit has already been successful in achieving zone status from the federal government which will allow the city access to development funds.
\
Also, House Bill 4730 has recently passed the House on a unanimous vote. The bill would create an Empowerment Zone development corporation to evaluate and monitor agency programs, solicit funding and grants, and acquire and lease real and personal property to allow for the e implementation of the strategic plan of the Empowerment Zone, which is to facilitate economic development.
\
Sen. Henry E. Stallings II 3rd District
\
Henry Stallings II has a long history of business and political involvement. After extensive experience in the corporate world Stallings opened his own business in 1981, Preferred Food Stamp Distributors Inc. He has worked in the administration of former Gov. James Blanchard. He is serving his first term in the Legislature.
\
Casino gaming: I am intent on creating Indian and/or non-Indian casinos in the festival market place environment replete with non-gaming amenities including hotels, theme restaurants and bars, performance spaces, movie theatres and a variety of retail experiences, fully integrated within the city of Detroit's green-way system as proposed by the mayor's Land Use Task Force.
\
Security tax credit: I am pressing for the adoption of legislation that would allow taxpayers who invest in security related alarm systems, grates, doors, bars, windows, fences, cameras, tags or guards for their primary residence or business to receive an income tax credit.
\
The effect of this credit would serve to reduce insurance costs and payouts as a result of crime proofing property in urban areas. It would enable law enforcement personnel to spend their time and money on other areas of police protection in the community.
\
Redeveloping urban brown fields: The intent is to create economic development initiatives in Detroit that will create jobs, training, other business opportunities, mass transit expansion and housing.
\
This incentive would work in tandem with Detroit's New Empowerment Zone and with P.A. 23 and P.A. 24 which created the Michigan Economic Growth Authority Board which can authorize Mega (SBT) credits to businesses who expand in Michigan and/or hire 25 net new employees located in the Empowerment Zone.
\
Reviving Detroit's housing stock: Create a restoration and revitalization authority formed by corporate foundations and state/city/county funding for the purpose of restoring and revitalizing housing in predetermined areas throughout Detroit.
\
Areas of consideration would include, but not be limited to, Brush Park, Russell Woods, Conant Gardens, southwest, north end, Boston Edison, Indian Village, West Village and other areas outside the Empowerment Zone.
\
Master retail revitalization plan: This plan would include the support of the Michigan Dept. of Transportation, Detroit Renaissance, Detroit Chamber of Commerce, Booker T. Washington Business Association, Detroit churches and others for the express purpose of developing retail and business strips along the various well traversed transporation nodes throughout Detroit.
\
The integration of a comprehensive mass transportation system that includes an above and below ground rail system, buses, skywalks with moving conveyors, helicopters and commerical watercrafts is absolutely necessary for the proper implementation of a workable and accessoriented retail/business development in Detroit. I contend that if we build it, they will come!
\
Sen. Virgil Smith 2nd District

\
Casino gaming: This measure was approved by the City of Detroit. It would provide increased employment opportunities, while also stimulating Detroit's economic climate.
\
Regional transportation: A regional transportation system would alleviate part of the burden on the City of Detroit by providing more participation by its urban neighbors. Further, it would give Detroit residents access to suburban employers and those in the suburbs access to Detroit employers.
\
Erection of a new downtown stadium: A new stadium would assist in the revitalization of the downtown area. Also, it would strengthen fan support for Detroit's professional sports teams.
\
Affordable housing: Every resident of the city of Detroit should be afforded clean, safe and affordable housing options.
\
New retail facilities: The opening of new retail facilities would provide increased employment opportunities and strengthen the city's tax base and economic vitality.

Rep. Martha G. Scott 6th District
\
Martha G. Scott is longtime political presence in the Detroit community. She has been president of the Highland Park City Council and also mayor of that Detroit enclave. Throughout her career she has fought tirelessly for programs which would improve the social and economic conditions of those she represents.
\
Education: Accesible neighborhood community colleges, K-12 funding -- school aid.
\
Insurance: Affordable insurance, access to insurance.
\
Conservation and environment: Clean air, pollution free (as much as possible) environment and rules for transporting hazardous waste.
\
Health: Immunization for children, medical coverge for seniors and affordable health coverge for all citizens.
\
Public utilities: Affordable rates in elecommunication.
\
Rep. Alma G. Stallworth 12th District
\
Alma Stallworth is Democratic vice chair of the power House Standing Committee on Public Utilities and a member of the House Committee on Health Policy.
\
Stallworth is president of the Black Child Development Institute and founder and administrator of the Black Caucus Foundation of Michigan.
\
Telecommunications: I am supportive of those initiatives that increase minority ownership within the telecommunications industry; increase the affordability and accessibility of advanced services to Detroit residents and businesses; increase the development fiber-optic infrastructure within the city; provide opportunities for distance learning to occur within Detroit Public Schools and assure that pay telephones are operative, accessible and affordable.
\
Violence in the community: Two bills have been introduced by me to promote the abstinence of violence, especially among youth. One of the bills prohibits and provides penalties for a parent(s) or legal guardian, under certain circumstances, who improperly stores or leaves a loaded firearm within the reach or access of a minor. The other develops and requires individuals to enroll in a pistol safety training program before issuance of a permit to purchase.
\
Gambling: It is estimated that Michigan economy will lose over $400 million in casino-related dollars in Windsor each year. Also Detroit will lose $50 million or more in annual tax revenues to Windsor and the job market in tourism and related service will likely suffer.
\
I am supportive of casino gaming if it can generate sufficient revenue for Detroit and provide job opportunities for its residents.
\
Rep. Ted Wallace 5th District
\
Ted Wallace is serving his fifth term in the House. A veteran of the Vietnam War, Wallace's background involves both law and accounting. He is the immediate past chairman of the Michigan Legislative Black Caucus.
\
Transportation: Creation of a regional transit authority merging our urban and suburban transit systems.
\
New stadium: State infrastructure aid for a new stadium in Detroit, particularly since a state investment would result in an immediate private investment of up to $200 million in downtown Detroit, and would be the impetus to all kinds of other economic development in the inner city.
\
Environment: ""Polluter pay"" legislation, which passed the House recently, makes it easier to move forward with redevelopment of urban property which has been polluted. It changes Michigan's environmental cleanup standards to reduce the burden that has discouraged job-creating redevelopment in the past.
\
The bill also provides valuable protection to property owners who inherited contamination by holding the original polluter strictly liable for the cost of cleanup.
\
Revenue sharing: I believe there should be full revenue sharing so that Detroit receives all the money it's entitled to under the law. These funds are needed for Detroit to provide essential services such as police and fire protection to our residents.
\
Strengthening schools: If we are to attract new families into our city, we must provide a safe and superior education for the students. We also want to make sure that our children have the education, skills and training to become productive citizens.
\
Rep. Burton Leland 13th District
\
Burton Leland is a former social worker with the Wayne County Dept. of Social Services. He was first elected to the House in 1980. He is the sponsor of Michigan's ""Auto Lemon Law"" and the ""Scrap Tire Recycling Act.""
\
Homeownership: I believe that to achieve meaningful urban revitalization we need an overall housing redevelopment plan to improve the quality of housing and to encourage home ownership.
\
Casino gaming: Since the voters of Detroit approved gaming and with the support of the mayor, I believe that we must move ahead with the issue. Gov. Engler's delay on making a decisions is costing our city millions lost revenue across the river!
\
Transportation: Any urban revitalization effort should include public transportation needs. Public transit systems meet the needs of seniors, youngsters, disabled and the most economically disadvantaged.
\
Public transit is too often the only means to a doctor, a job or to school. Public transportation needs public support through dedicated millages. It cannot be supported on fares alone.
\
Crime: Help local government effectively fight and prevent crime. We need to focus our attention in the areas of crime prevention and drug treatment so that more citizens can avoid lives of crime. We need funding to increase the number of local police on our streets and expand the use of community policing, a crime fighting approach that has shown real promise in our neighborhoods.
\
Empowerment zones: Detroit was named one of only nine communities to receive Empowerment Zone designation. This will guarantee Detroit some of the means to revitalize the city's most distressed neighborhoods and stimulate the creation of new jobs.
\
Rep. Ilona Varga 8th District
\
Ilona Varga has been a member of the House since 1986 and has sponsored numerous bills. Her current legislative endeavors are bills to protect vulnerable citizens.
\
Among several bills introduced by her, House Bill 4001 was proposed to protect low income senior citizen homeowners from having their homes seized for the inability to afford property taxes. Varga has also introduced a package of bills to combat some of the problems affliated with unsafe boarding homes.
\
Rep. Curtis Hertel House Democratic Leader 2nd District
\
Curtis Hertel was recently elected to the position of Democratic co-leader by his colleagues. Noted as a key legislator in the area of child protection, Hertel is responsible for passage of legislation to establish the Children's Trust Fund and legislation to create Michigan's law guarding against parental child snatching.
\
Budget process: A government's ability to tax inherently implies that there will be winners and losers. The average per capita expenditure in the state was $1,930.29, yet Wayne County residents are financing projects through the state and yet are not getting an equitable return on their investment.
\
As the 1995-96 budget process continues, House Democrats will be looking at equity and funding for all of Michigan cities. The proportion between what is paid to the state and what is given back must be considered.
\
Community policing: House Democrats have sponsored legislation (HB 4667) to help local governments effectively fight crime. This bill will provide seriously needed funding to increase the number of local police officers on Michigan streets as well as expand the use of community policing.
\
Education reform and school safety: Gov. Engler has called the repeal of the Michigan school code, which contains a number of recently enacted school reforms. Among these are the core academic curriculum, the state endorsed diploma and school accredidation standards.
\
The House recently passed Democratic legislation to provide school districts with options to the state mandate that every child who possesses a dangerous weapon or commits sexual assualts in a weapons-free school zone be expelled. School districts are free to permanently expel the pulpit by refusing to reinstate him or her.
\
Environmental response: To spur urban development, Michigan is changing to risk-based and land-based use clean up standards. This will hold those who contaminate responsible for clean up costs, removing liability from lenders who have not participated in the management of the property prior to assuming ownership or control of the property.
\
This will also protect from liablity those who purchase property after it has been determined that an environmental clean up will be necessary.
\
Public transportation: No transit system in the nation is supported on farebox revenues alone, and all but a few public transit systems in Michigan are supported by dedicated millages.
\
The structure of public transportation may well be revised to develop a program with less redundancy and more regional cooperation, but given its role in Michigan economy, the system cannot be ignored.
\
Rep. Ed Vaughn 4th District
\
Edward Vaughn is one of the deans of afrocentric history related issues. He has been executive assistant to former Mayor Coleman Young and served in the House from 1979-80. He was returned to the House this year.
\
HPCC: To secure Detroit's financial future, Highland Park Community College must be saved and the Detroit equity package, casino gambling, adequate funding for public schools, no cut-backs in social programs and affirmative action are all issues that must be pressed.
\
Takeovers: I will fight to prevent the state from taking over the Detroit Water Dept. and/or any other city-owned facility.
\
Devil's night, more youth programs: Push for a ""family day-holiday family night"" designation to end so-called Devil's Night in Detroit and throughout the state.
\
In addition, I plan to press for greater recreation facilities and programs in my district and promote passage of legislation to create a Michigan Youth and Conservation Corp that will be a catalyst to eliminate crime and develop positive work ethics.
\
Rep. Mary Lou Parks 3rd District
\
Mary Lou Parks has had extensive public service experience which has included being an executive assistant to former Congressman George W. Crockett Jr. and a liaison to State Democratic Party Chairman Gary Corbin with the city of Detroit. She is in her second term of office.
\
Economic Development: Certainly economic development is a major concern. I believe that as state representative we in state government must create opportunities for Detroit-based business owners to grow and expand, thus creating jobs in the city.
\
Also we must do all we can do to assist in the development of the Detroit Empowerment Zone. I intend to pay close attention to how the $100 million in Empowerment Zone funds are spent in Detroit. I will work with other business and civic leaders to bring development and jobs to the Detroit community.
\
Education: Education is a priority. We must work to prepare our children for this modern, technological world of instant communication and high technology.
\
We need to improve the delivery of education on every level, create new and innovative methods to teach, as well as develop curriculum based on the future needs of business as they respond to the changing needs of society and the global economy.
\
Teaching the electorate: We must educate our communities and voters on the issues and events that effect our city and its residents. I think we must organize our constituents to be active in the political process and to voice their concerns. We must not allow the state or federal government to turn back to the old policies of governmental neglect and indifference.
\
Countering cuts: The proposed cuts in housing, school lunches, food stamps, summer jobs and other social programs on the state and federal levels would be devastating to the city. I plan to work with other legislators to insure the continuation of these programs through pro-active legislation.
\
Seniors: Services for senior citizens must be expanded and protected. We in state government must join the fight for health care for all senior citizens. We must provide assistance to seniors who find themselves raising their grandchildren and other minor children.
\
We also must work to insure that seniors are protected from crime in a special way. We as lawmakers must see to it that senior citizens experience the best ""quality of life"" possible.
\
Rep. Morris Hood 11th District
\
Morris Hood was elected to the House in 1970. Among his committee assignments are the House Appropriations and Capital Outlay, Higher Eduation and Regulatory. In 1979 Hood was elected founding chair of the Michigan Legislative Black Caucus. Earlier this year he was elected chair of the caucus to serve during the 1995-96 legislative session.
\
Hood has said that the following issues are top priority for him: the Detroit equity package, education and the restoration of funds for Highland Park Community College, casino gaming, a new Tiger Stadium and revenue sharing.
\
He says he is also addressing the problem of minority contractors not receiving their fair share of the state funded road repair contracts.
\
Rep. Michael J. Bennane 14th District
\
Michael Bennane was elected to the House in 1976 and organized the House Democratic Study Group. He was chosen by his Democratic colleagues as its first chairperson. He currently serves as the minority vice chair of the House Health Policy Committee as well as being a member of the House Tax Policy Committee.
\
Gambling, Tiger Stadium: Securing both of these for Detroit would go a long way in improving the environment of Detroit's downtown. Detroit has always suffered from a lack of entertainment, hotel and restaurant facilities.
\
Partially due to Detroit's geographic location, (outside of the normal east-west flow of national traffic), we have struggled to develop these industries. Both casino gaming and a new stadium would help the city develop these areas and would result in jobs and tax dollars to help pay for educational necessities.
\
Technical training: Detroit schools should move swiftly to provide the technical training necessary in this modern age. Not every student needs or desires a college preparatory course. More options should be available in the technical/trade area. Labor unions should be made a part of such a plan, helping to formulate the needed curricula.
\
Housing: Detroit's neighborhoods continue to suffer from abandoned homes. Estimates range up to 70 percent of the housing stock being owned by absentee landlords. I have passed legislation in the past allowing the city to personally go after owners of property for back taxes and the cost of demolition, if necessary.
\
The process for the city to take ownership of these properties has also been sped up through legislation already passed. I am beginning a project in conjunction with the City of Detroit and Wayne State's law school to utilize this legislation and move the process of reclaiming/demolition forward.
\
Creative tax initiatives: Pennsylvania and Hawaii have had for years the option of land-based taxation for certain areas of their respective states. Pure landbased taxation places the value, and the resultant taxation, on the land itself with no increase in taxation for use.
\
I am exploring the utilization of such a scheme for Detroit's downtown and specific business areas throughout the city. A hybrid form that shifts some more of the value to the land might be appropriate for our city.
\
Spurring business: The city has already designated specific areas of Detroit as business cluster zones. I am developing legislation that would provide tax relief for businesses locating or relocating to the cluster areas.
\
Rep. Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick 9th District.
\
Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick is a native of Detroit and was first elected to the House in 1978. In 1984 she was selected to participate in the first of its kind Michigan African Trade Mission and visited several African countries.
\
Economic development priorities: I have sponsored and passed in both the House and Senate and am waiting for the governor's signature, enabling legislation for the Empowerment Zone.
\
The legislation will set up the process to receive $100 million from the federal government, authorize the creation of Empowerment Zone development corporations and establish the Empowerment Zone board. This will begin the process of redevelopment in the city of Detroit.
\
As vice chairperson of the House Transportation Committee I have been appointed chair-person of the House Task Force on Roads and Public Transit Improvement. We have held several hearings and will decide what gas tax, if any, will be assessed and how much our area will receive for repairing our roads.
\
Lastly, I have been appointed by Speaker Hillegonds to serve on the National Conference of State Legislatures Assembly on State Issues on the Commerce, Labor and Economic Development Committee. This committee studies a wide range of state strategies, policies and programs that seek to promote economic development.
\
The committee is responsible for reviewing major labor and management issues and provide a forum for discussion of these issues.
"
101,"LANSING – Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is nearing an impasse with Republican legislative leaders on the 2020 budget, says Michigan needs an extra $2.5 billion a year to fix the roads.\A set of bills introduced in the House this spring would amend Michigan's constitution to create a graduated income tax, under which those who earn more would pay a higher tax rate. The estimated annual revenue boost? $2.5 billion.\The fact those numbers match is not a coincidence.\Whitmer, who has proposed a 45-cent-per-gallon hike in Michigan's fuel tax, said during her 2018 campaign that if lawmakers are not prepared to approve higher user fees to fix the roads, she is prepared to take her case to the voters.\It's looking increasingly likely that if Whitmer and Republican leaders don't reach a deal on significant revenue increases, Michigan voters could be asked to approve a graduated income tax, often referred to as a progressive income tax, possibly as early as the November 2020 election.\""It's my understanding that there are some that are working on that kind of a proposal,"" Whitmer told the Free Press during an appearance in Flint Tuesday.\""That's something that certainly I've supported in the past and something that I would take a close look at.""\Asked whether she would take her proposed gas tax increase to the voters, Whitmer said ""it's too early to speculate"" and she remains committed to reaching a budget deal with GOP lawmakers that will ""fix the damn roads,"" while allowing her to commit additional funding to education and the environment.\State Rep. Robert Wittenberg, D-Huntington Woods, a main sponsor of the income tax legislation who worked with Treasury Department officials to make sure his plan arrived at the same ""magic number"" the governor is seeking, said several grassroots groups – none ready to go public – are exploring plans to get the question on the ballot.\""It's an equity issue,"" Wittenberg told the Free Press. There is an ""appetite of the people in this country for making sure people are paying their fair share.""\The package Wittenberg and his co-sponsors introduced in the House this year is not necessarily the same one that would go to voters, if backers are able to collect the more than 425,000 valid signatures required to get it on the ballot.\But House Bills 4481 and 4482 provide one example of how a Michigan graduated income tax system might be set up.\Rather than the current rate of 4.25% imposed on taxable income, the bills would:\Impose a 4% rate on the first $5,000 of taxable income, a 4.25% rate on taxable income between $5,000 and $75,000, and an 8.4% rate on taxable income above $75,000\Set a $5,000 personal exemption, up from $4,050 currently, but reduce that exemption for filers with taxable income over $80,000 (or joint filers with income over $160,000)\Eliminate the exemption for filers with taxable income above $100,000 (or joint filers above $200,000).\The Michigan Treasury Department analyzed the bills package without taking a position on it.\Treasury spokesman Ron Leix confirmed the bills would raise an extra $2.5 billion in their first full year of implementation, and that 92% of Michigan filers would either get a tax cut or have their taxes stay the same under the plan.\The roughly 400,000 filers receiving a tax increase – single filers with taxable incomes above $75,300 and joint filers with taxable incomes above $150,600 – would receive tax increases averaging about $6,250, Leix confirmed. Though that would be the average increase, in order to get an increase as high as $6,250, a married couple filing jointly would need to have taxable income of at least $300,000, Leix said.\Higher tax rates for higher income earners has been part of the federal income tax system for more than a century, and it is more the rule than the exception among states.\Of the 41 states that impose an income tax on wage and salary income, 32 use a graduated system.\While Michigan taxes all personal income at 4.25%, even some states that are seen as much more conservative tax higher-income earners at higher rates. Alabama, for example, taxes some earners at 2%, others at 4%, and still others at 5%. Tax brackets in Oklahoma range from 0.5% to 5%. In Louisiana, the rates range from 2% to 6%.\Though Kentucky just moved from a graduated income tax to a flat tax system, Illinois, which, like Michigan, replaced a Republican governor with a Democratic one in 2018, will vote on moving to a graduated income tax in 2020.\Whitmer said Tuesday she remains in regular contact with House Speaker Lee Chatfield, R-Levering, and Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, while the Legislature is on summer recess, and she expects to meet with them in the next week.\But she and GOP lawmakers remain far apart on her $2.5-billion gas tax proposal, and Whitmer describes as ""non-starters"" plans the Republicans have floated to raise road money by borrowing against teacher pension funds or sell off assets such as the Blue Water Bridge.\Though Michigan residents want their roads fixed, the idea of a 45-cent-per-gallon gas tax hike has been hugely unpopular.\An April poll by Marketing Resource Group found that 75% of Michigan voters – and even a majority of Democrats – oppose the plan.\A recent poll suggests a proposal to move Michigan to a graduated income tax would fare much better.\The May poll, conducted by TargetSmart for the State Innovative Exchange, found that 76% of respondents supported a graduated income tax under which ""millionaires pay more and working people get a tax cut.""\Because of the way she constructed her budget, the proposed 45-cent gas tax increase would help fund more than just improved roads.\Though it would increase gross revenues by $2.5 billion, the plan would actually increase road revenues by a net amount of $1.9 billion. That's because it would allow Whitmer to shift $600 million in general fund money that is now targeted for roads to help pay for other priorities, such as schools and the environment.\A $2.5 billion revenue boost from a graduated income tax would allocate 22.7% of net revenues to the School Aid Fund, according to the bill. It would allow Whitmer and lawmakers, if they so choose, to take the sales tax off of gasoline and replace it with fuel taxes, while having more than enough School Aid Fund revenue to replace revenues lost through removing the sales tax from fuel sales.\A graduated income tax is banned under Michigan's constitution, which would have to be amended by voters.\To get the question on the November 2020 ballot, organizers would have to submit at least 425,059 valid signatures by July 6 of next year.\Though several progressive, school, environmental and good government groups are looking at such a proposal, according to Wittenberg and others, none is ready to go public. Several sources told the Free Press that planning is at an early stage.\That means it would be tough, though not impossible, to get a proposal on the 2020 ballot, said Kathy Barks Hoffman, vice president of the Lansing-based public relations firm Martin Waymire.\It would cost millions to organize the proposal and collect the signatures, and Hoffman said it would have a well-funded opposition from groups opposing such a change.\A graduated income tax ""would be another way to raise money,"" Hoffman said. ""Some folks prefer this over a sales tax increase as more progressive. But one reason we don't have a graduated income tax is there are people willing to oppose it.""\Michigan residents have actually voted three times on a graduated income tax: in 1968, 1972, and 1976. They rejected the idea all three times, by percentages of 77-23, 69-31, and 72-28, respectively.\The question is whether growing concerns about unequal distribution of wealth would be enough to reverse those numbers.\""The hard-working people of Michigan are eager for a fairer tax structure,"" said Tom Lenard, Michigan director of the State Innovation Exchange, a national strategy and resource organization for progressive state legislators.\"" As we've seen in other states, it's possible to create a revenue system that reduces tax rates for lower-income families, finally requires the wealthy to pay their share, and provide enough resources to improve our infrastructure, schools, and communities.""\Michigan Republicans oppose such a change, partly because it would result in a net tax increase.\Like the proposed 45-cent gas tax hike, ""it doesn't seem like it's a very innovative solution,"" said state Rep. Lynn Afendoulis, R-Grand Rapids Township, chairwoman of the House Tax Policy Committee.\""I think that the state has come a long way financially during the last administration,"" of former Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, Afendoulis said.\""We've taken into consideration many options, and I think that we shouldn't touch where we are right now,"" she said. ""We're in a better place.""\Many business groups oppose a graduated income tax.\Most notable is the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, widely considered to be the state's most influential business lobbying group.\The Michigan Chamber ""is strongly opposed to proposals to impose a massive tax increase on families, entrepreneurs and job providers by eliminating Michigan's long-standing taxpayer protection against a graduated income tax,"" the group said in response to an earlier proposal from Democrats.\""This sends a clear message about the direction that Michigan Democrats want the state to go: immediate and blatant redistribution of wealth that punishes individuals and job providers for being successful.""\Contact Paul Egan: 517-372-8660 or pegan@freepress.com.

103,"Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is nearing an impasse with Republican legislative leaders on the 2020 budget, says Michigan needs an extra $2.5 billion a year to fix the roads.\A set of bills introduced in the House this spring would amend Michigan's constitution to create a graduated income tax, under which those who earn more would pay a higher tax rate. The estimated annual revenue boost? $2.5 billion.\The fact those numbers match is not a coincidence.\Whitmer, who has proposed a 45-cent-per-gallon hike in Michigan's fuel tax, said during her 2018 campaign that if lawmakers are not prepared to approve higher user fees to fix the roads, she is prepared to take her case to the voters.\It's looking increasingly likely that if Whitmer and Republican leaders don't reach a deal on significant revenue increases, Michigan voters could be asked to approve a graduated income tax, often referred to as a progressive income tax, possibly as early as the November 2020 election.\""It's my understanding that there are some that are working on that kind of a proposal,"" Whitmer told the Free Press in Flint on Tuesday.\""That's something that certainly I've supported in the past and something that I would take a close look at.""\Asked whether she would take her proposed gas tax increase to the voters, Whitmer said ""it's too early to speculate"" and she remains committed to reaching a budget deal with GOP lawmakers that will ""fix the damn roads,"" while allowing her to commit additional funding to education and the environment.\State Rep.

Though that would be the average increase, in order to get an increase as high as $6,250, a married couple filing jointly would need to have taxable income of at least $300,000, Leix said.\Higher tax rates for higher income earners has been part of the federal income tax system for more than a century, and it is more the rule than the exception among states.\Of the 41 states that impose an income tax on wage and salary income, 32 use a graduated system.\While Michigan taxes all personal income at 4.25%, even some states that are seen as much more conservative tax higher-income earners at higher rates. Alabama, for example, taxes some earners at 2%, others at 4%, and still others at 5%. Tax brackets in Oklahoma range from 0.5% to 5%. In Louisiana, the rates range from 2% to 6%.\Though Kentucky just moved from a graduated income tax to a flat tax system, Illinois, which, like Michigan, replaced a Republican governor with a Democratic in 2018, will vote on moving to a graduated income tax in 2020.\Whitmer said Tuesday she remains in regular contact with House Speaker Lee Chatfield, R-Levering, and Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, while the Legislature is on summer recess, and she expects to meet with them in the next week.\But she and GOP lawmakers remain far apart on her $2.5-billion gas tax proposal, and Whitmer describes as ""non-starters"" plans the Republicans have floated to raise road money by borrowing against teacher pension funds or sell off assets such as the Blue Water Bridge.\Though Michigan residents want their roads fixed, the idea of a 45-cent-per-gallon gas tax hike has been hugely unpopular.\An April poll by Marketing Resource Group found that 75% of Michigan voters – and even a majority of Democrats – oppose the plan.\A recent poll suggests a proposal to move Michigan to a graduated income tax would fare much better.\The May poll, conducted by TargetSmart for the State Innovative Exchange, found that 76% of respondents supported a graduated income tax under which ""millionaires pay more and working people get a tax cut.""\Because of the way she constructed her budget, the proposed 45-cent gas tax increase would help fund more than just improved roads.\Though it would increase gross revenues by $2.5 billion, the plan would actually increase road revenues by a net amount of $1.9 billion.

It would allow Whitmer and lawmakers, if they so choose, to take the sales tax off of gasoline and replace it with fuel taxes, while having more than enough School Aid Fund revenue to replace revenues lost through removing the sales tax from fuel sales.\A graduated income tax is banned under Michigan's constitution, which would have to be amended by voters.\To get the question on the November 2020 ballot, organizers would have to submit at least 425,059 valid signatures by July 6 of next year.\Though several progressive, school, environmental and good government groups are looking at such a proposal, according to Wittenberg and others, none is ready to go public.

105,"Andrea LaFontaine: The greatest challenge faced by residents in the 32nd District is jobs. While our current unemployment rate is 8.5%, compared with 14.2% in August 2009, there are still many people out of work and struggling to make ends meet. The repeal of the Michigan Business Tax in 2011 was a step in the right direction, however there is much more work to be done to truly make Michigan a place for job providers to locate. The repeal of the Personal Property Tax will provide much needed relief to businesses who are being punished for increased investment, and additional reforms to our regulatory structure will make the process of starting a business much easier.\Michael Schmina: The greatest challenges facing the people of the 32nd district are jobs and the stagnant economy. I believe that individuals and business--especially small, local businesses--are over-regulated and over-taxed by a state government that tries to do more than it can and should do; and therefore spends too much of our money. I will strive to create a better business environment by cutting the size and cost of the state government by eliminating redundancies in favor of local control.\Michigan's roads need fixing. How will we get the money to do it?\LaFontaine: Michigan's roads are in need of increased investment to maintain and improve their quality, however I do not support increasing revenues until we have ensured that our current revenues are being used properly. For instance, not all revenues from the gas tax go to roads and bridges, and other funds distributed by the state for road projects are sometimes squandered on administrative costs. Until we have maximized our current investment, I would not support increasing costs or fees on Michigan's hardworking taxpayers.\Schmina: Michigan's roads need fixing. We need to stop diverting transportation to non-road uses and push hard on the federal government to return all of the transportation dollars it raises here without an endless list of conditions. The main form of transportation in Michigan is on our roads, before Lansing asks for one additional dollar in taxes we need to start spending transportation dollars on the roads where it is most needed.\How would you assure local officials who face the loss of personal property tax revenue?\LaFontaine: I support the repeal of the personal property tax, however local units of government should not bear the full cost of the loss of revenue. I understand the importance of this issue and the revenue that local governments rely on, and acknowledge that a quick fix will not work. The legislature has so far proceeded with caution to ensure that the final product makes sense to all stakeholders. Local governments have faced very difficult decisions in recent years due to the decline in property tax revenue and cuts to state revenue sharing. The current proposal to repeal the personal property tax replaces that lost revenue with expiring tax credits, which provides assurances to local governments that Lansing will not continue its record of broken promises. That proposal also includes clauses that stipulate if replacement revenues are not provided, the personal property tax would be phased back in. Lawmakers have been, and continue to work with local governments on a solution that would preserve their revenues, while providing much needed relief to job providers.\Schmina: The PPT is a nightmare--whenever I try to explain it to people who have never paid it, they have a hard time understanding that such a thing exists and even many people in the local governments that rely on it admit that it is difficult and byzantine tax. It needs to be eliminated. In order to grow and flourish, Michigan needs a state government that spends less money, which will free up resources to for local communities without raising taxes.\What actions should be taken to increase job creation in the area?\LaFontaine: To increase job creation in the area, we can continue to promote the Blue Water area and the resources the area has for businesses. The area has tremendous existing infrastructure that make the region attractive to job providers, and we must continue to promote that. Our geographic location as well as the accessibility of the Blue Water Bridge provides many opportunities for businesses to expand to new markets. Additionally, continuing to decrease the regulatory burden that is placed on employers will make Michigan an overall better place for job providers to locate. Finally, Michigan is home to an extremely talented and well-educated workforce, however the changing economy has resulted in shifting needs for skilled workers. Increased access to job training and career technical education programs will provide opportunities for those seeking work to gain the skills needed to compete in the job market.\Schmina: Michigan's business environment is not friendly to small businesses and start-ups. Confusing and onerous taxes, regulations, and labor laws make it very difficult for individuals to follow their dreams and start their own businesses. In today's economy, we need to recognize that our small businesses are what keep our local communities working. The days of one industry providing middle-class jobs for recent high school graduates is long gone, and we should be poised to encourage economic growth by getting government out of the way and allow people to create their own jobs.\How will you make sure the Blue Water Area's voice is heard in Lansing?\LaFontaine: Since taking office, I have maintained a close relationship with community leaders and local elected officials to ensure the Blue Water Area is well represented in Lansing. I will continue to build upon these relationships and as a member on the House Local Government Committee has given me an opportunity to ensure the voices of our local governments are heard. Additionally, since taking office, I have held over 50 'office hours' and met with hundreds of local residents to hear their concerns, and I will continue to maintain close relations with the hardworking taxpayers in the Blue Water Area.\Schmina: I have been a tax paying homeowner in St. Clair County for 10 years. Two kids have graduated from local schools and a fourth is about to enter kindergarten. I am invested in my community, in the Blue Water Area and Anchor Bay, as well as all of the beautiful rural areas in between. I live here and love it here. I have many ties here, including the Immaculate Conception Church, the Pearl Beech Lions, and the St. Clair County Council on Aging. I have no desire to get away from that. As a long-time resident, the policies in Lansing affect my neighbors, my community, and my family. I have a vested interest in making the voices from the 32nd District heard in Lansing. As your state representative, I will continue to live here, listen to my community and share our concerns with the lawmakers in our capitol. While I will work in Lansing, I will not live there. I will not become a part of the pampered ruling class.\At a glance\Andrea LaFontaine (R)\Age: 25\Address: 10317 Big Hand Road, Columbus\Occupation: State representative\Political experience: Serving first term as state representative\Family: Father, Chuck LaFontaine; mother, Cathy LaFontaine; brother, Chuck LaFontaine\Michael Shmina (R)\Age: 45\Address: 7911 Bouvier Bay Road, Fair Haven\Occupation: Project Manager for A.Z.

106,"Last Sunday's editorial suggesting toll roads for Michigan (""Time for tolls"") omitted one important point: The millions it will cost to set up and maintain a toll road system. Another bureaucracy is not what Michigan needs. Nor do we need additional taxes, which is exactly what a toll road system is. The entire concept is absurd. How much of the revenue generated by toll roads would be consumed by its oversight?\To lengthen road life, why not build road surfaces thicker, produce them with concrete, and limit large truck weights?\Budget tightening, reprioritizing Michigan's shrinking revenues, and better road-building methods are the answers to our road repair financing.\Thomas A. Powers Jr., Indian River\Charge trucks\I agree with putting toll roads in Michigan. Having said that, I wonder why we can't charge tolls to all the trucks coming across from Canada at the two bridges and tunnel. Most of the trucks I see going down I-94 and I-75 don't stop in Michigan, and the volume is huge. This tears up our roads prematurely and causes other routes besides the interstates to deteriorate, because of detours as the interstates are repaired. Who pays for that?\Ralph Rappuhn\Grosse Ile\Traffic-slowing tolls\Toll roads are a terrible idea for Michigan. Have you ever driven in Chicago, New York or Boston on their constantly irritating, traffic-slowing toll roads? They are a royal pain. And, yes, I know they can collect the taxes electronically from those who have paid to have a chip in their car that records their road use. The trouble is that not everyone has those chips, and they slow down to throw change in the basket at every toll, slowing everyone.\Our politicians should have the guts and the brains to explain why a higher gas tax or vehicle license tax is needed and clearly demonstrate that the money is going directly into improving our roads. Then, and only then, will the citizens go along.\Cliff Sevakis\Rochester Hills\Lower weight limits\Instead of adding toll roads to Michigan's highways, perhaps it's time to adjust Michigan's gargantuan weight tolerances. At 164,000 pounds, Michigan allows more weight per tractor-trailer than any other state in the nation, and more than twice as much as the 80,000-pound federal weight allowances. Is it any surprise our roads disintegrate as fast as they do?\Ben Harwood\Royal Oak\Just raise gas tax\Yes, we need to fix our roads in Michigan, and, yes, it will cost more money, and the best answer is not toll roads.\To set up toll roads, you need to build (spend money) on infrastructure, on toll booths and to pay more people -- toll collectors, administrators and enforcers. Plus there is the issue of avoiding the tolls and the back-ups at the toll booths, which can waste time and gas. All for what, to avoid an increase in a gas tax?\On the other hand, a gas tax is more equitable and to the point -- the more you use the more you drive the more you support road repair. Yes, those with better mileage would pay a little less, but they have less emissions and cause less damage to the roads they travel.\Bob Pettapiece\Detroit\No more fees, taxes\The idea of imposing tolls when so many people in Michigan are unemployed is very shortsighted. Why doesn't the Legislature work to set lower truck load limits for one and, second, push the state's congressional delegation to stop the bleeding of Michigan's poor roads by being a donor state in regards to the federal money doled out to the states?\Think of something that does not inflict more taxes on the motoring public.\Walter E. Lewis\Warren\Add a penny per gallon\Trying to fix Michigan roads by selectively adding toll booths to various highly traveled interstates is a bad idea. It requires building new infrastructure to collect money. It requires hiring folks to collect that money. It can lead to the addition of costly tech gadgets to collect money. Slowing down for toll booths wastes fuel. Just adding a few toll booths will eventually lead to adding more and more to satisfy those who want to create bigger empires and fill other greedy budgets.\There is already a system for collecting taxes for roads in place. That is the gasoline tax. Just add a penny per gallon to the tax every other month for a year or so and we can collect the road money without everybody going broke on one day.\Bill Anderson\Highland\See the benefits\Toll roads have the potential to be a powerful fiscal instrument for the state and can be implemented in a fairly equitable and efficient manner. Tolls have proved successful in other states and countries; however, governments must consider the trade-offs.\For example, a toll system will have an adverse effect on lower-class residents, especially in a region with inadequate mass transit. Tolls would also have an impact on the alternative free system of roads in our state. Diverting traffic to these roads would increase congestion on side streets and damage these roads even more.\Overall, toll roads are productive, given the environment to accommodate the system. Whether or not Michigan provides such an environment is the essential question. Our state desperately needs a toll system to maintain its infrastructure; however, we also need leaders who are willing to look into the future and see its benefits.\Marlon I. Brown\Warren\One-third drained off\Toll roads will require infrastructure we don't need and bureaucracy we have too much of -- namely toll booths and an organization to collect the tolls. When I was in college, I heard that approximately one-third of the toll money collected on the New York State Thruway went to maintaining the toll booths and paying the collectors. Based on a quick review of the recent financial statements for the Thruway and the Pennsylvania Turnpike, that still seems to be true. Why should Michiganders pay tolls when only two-thirds will go to fixing the roads? If the money is needed, raising the gas tax would be far simpler and more efficient.\Angelo P.

$1.4B needed for roads
\
Southfield -- Michigan needs another $1.4 billion for roads annually and Gov. Rick Snyder on Wednesday suggested hiking vehicle registration fees to help come up with the money.
\
In an address on infrastructure at Lawrence Technological University, the Republican governor said an extra $120 a year -- $10 a month -- on each registration would raise $1 billion a year. More money could be raised if voters approve allowing counties and regions to assess their own vehicle registration levies of up to $40 annually.
\
""Michigan's infrastructure is living on borrowed time,"" he said.
\
Snyder cautioned that the proposed $10 monthly fee is not finalized. ""I want a public discussion on these issues,"" he said. ""I'm not proposing anything specific to the Legislature.""
\
The $1.4 billion target is based on the findings of a House Republicans' road study released in September, but Snyder's strategy to reach that goal is expected to meet with resistance from Republicans who control the House and Senate and have vowed they will resist any tax increases.
\
The registration fee funding would be needed on top of revenues to be generated by a Snyder proposal to switch from a 19-cents-per-gallon retail gas tax to a tax on wholesale fuel prices. Revenues would be held at their current level by initially setting the wholesale fuel tax at 6.7 percent, Department of Transportation Director Kirk Steudle said later.
\
The proposals were part of a far-reaching strategy Snyder unveiled to stabilize transportation funding and improve Michigan's roads, public transit, Internet and sewer systems.
\
Among his ideas:
\
Rapid transit that would connect Detroit with its suburbs, Ann Arbor and Detroit Metropolitan Airport.
\
A new fiber optic cable across the Mackinac Bridge to increase Internet access in the Upper Peninsula.
\
Competitively bidding out maintenance services, engineering or construction of roads.
\
Accessing federal money for dredging ports around the state.
\
Helping communities maintain or improve water quality.
\
Giving counties the option to take over their road commissions, or consolidating local commissions. Snyder noted Michigan has 617 independent road agencies and 79 independent transit agencies.
\
""We are the only state in the country that has county road commissions -- 81 of them in total -- and 35 of those are not accountable to the rest of county government,"" he said.
\
Changing the way road money is distributed from the state to local governments so it's targeted to needs. Thirty-nine percent of state and federal road funds goes to the state, while 39 percent goes to county road commissions and 22 percent to cities and villages.
\
Surrounded by a half-dozen graphs and charts, Snyder said Michigan's infrastructure is deteriorating from a lack of investment, and state and local road programs are organized on an antiquated model devised when the Legislature wrote the state's main road act in 1951.
\
""It's wise to update things every 60 years, right?"" he quipped.
\
Snyder called for an end to county road commissions, which he said are ""unneeded"" -- a proposal that dovetailed with bipartisan legislation introduced Wednesday in the House that would allow county commissions to take over their road planning.
\
""The world has changed,"" Snyder said.
\
Snyder also put in a plug for a new bridge between Detroit and Windsor. The New International Trade Crossing suffered a setback in the Legislature last week when a Senate committee voted against legislation setting up a public-private authority to build and run the bridge.
\
Senate Majority Leader Randy Richardville of Monroe has said the issue is on hold until the end of the year at the earliest.
\
He also supported construction of a new Soo Lock to accommodate larger Lakes freighters.
\
Some cite plan's problems
\
Convincing Republicans in control of the House and Senate may prove challenging for the governor. Former Gov. Jennifer Granholm, a Democrat, had proposed a tax on the wholesale price of fuel, but the Legislature was cool to the idea.
\
State Rep. Rick Olson, R-Saline, co-chairman of the bipartisan House work group that reported the $1.4 billion shortage, said he supports Snyder's plan to change the way gas tax revenue is collected.
\
""The gas tax is insufficient and unreliable and, meanwhile, the cost of road construction and reconstruction is going up,"" Olson said following Snyder's talk.
\
But his Republican colleague, Sen. Tom Casperson of Escanaba, sees problems with the plan.
\
""The switch of the gas tax is concerning, just because nobody wants to come out swinging and say let's raise taxes,"" Casperson said.
\
Vehicle registrations are based on the value of the vehicle for models 1984 and newer; older vehicles are taxed on their weight. The Secretary of State's office estimates vehicle registration fees bring in about $950 million a year.
\
Franklin resident George Haddad nixed the idea of a county vehicle registration fee.
\
""My answer is 'no,'"" he said. ""I think they're trying to dissect the problem from the wrong end. There is still plenty of fat in the cumulative budgets ... rather than tax for more money.""
\
Mike Nystrom, executive vice president of the Michigan Infrastructure and Transportation Association, said his group is happy the governor offered long-term solutions to the state's infrastructure problems.
\
""We hope the House and Senate will follow the governor's bold leadership, and we look forward to working with the governor and Legislature to pass this long-awaited, long-term funding solution,"" he said in a statement.
\
Cutbacks hurt road funds
\
Jim Shea of P.K. Contracting, a Troy road-painting company, said he's ""energized"" by Snyder's plan.
\
""I think it's really great,"" said Shae, who attended the Snyder presentation. ""He's looking for input from every party and is interested in road construction.""
\
Michigan's road funds have declined as consumers have cut back on purchases due to gasoline prices spiking as high as $4 a gallon. A wholesale tax would allow revenues to rise or fall with changing fuel prices instead of tying gas tax revenue to consumption. Michiganians still would have to pay an 18-cent federal tax and a 6 percent Michigan sales tax on every gallon purchased.
\
Tim Fisher, deputy policy director with the Michigan Environmental Council, said he liked what he heard, but isn't sure if the recommendations will fly with in the Legislature.
\
""He's quite right that the funding scheme we're dealing with right now was built for the 1950s,"" said Fisher, whose group represents environment and public health groups across the state.
\
""But we have a block of legislators who have made pledges against new taxes.""

""The switch of the gas tax is concerning, just because nobody wants to come out swinging and say let's raise taxes,"" Casperson said.
\
Vehicle registrations are based on the value of the vehicle for models 1984 and newer; older vehicles are taxed on their weight. The Secretary of State's office estimates vehicle registration fees bring in about $950 million a year.
\
Franklin resident George Haddad nixed the idea of a county vehicle registration fee.
\
""My answer is 'no,'"" he said. ""I think they're trying to dissect the problem from the wrong end. There is still plenty of fat in the cumulative budgets ... rather than tax for more money.""
\
Mike Nystrom, executive vice president of the Michigan Infrastructure and Transportation Association, said his group is happy the governor offered long-term solutions to the state's infrastructure problems.
\
""We hope the House and Senate will follow the governor's bold leadership, and we look forward to working with the governor and Legislature to pass this long-awaited, long-term funding solution,"" he said in a statement.
\
Cutbacks hurt road funds
\
Jim Shea of P.K. Contracting, a Troy road-painting company, said he's ""energized"" by Snyder's plan.
\
""I think it's really great,"" said Shae, who attended the Snyder presentation. ""He's looking for input from every party and is interested in road construction.""
\
Michigan's road funds have declined as consumers have cut back on purchases due to gasoline prices spiking as high as $4 a gallon. A wholesale tax would allow revenues to rise or fall with changing fuel prices instead of tying gas tax revenue to consumption. Michiganians still would have to pay an 18-cent federal tax and a 6 percent Michigan sales tax on every gallon purchased.
\
Tim Fischer, deputy policy director with the Michigan Environmental Council, said he liked what he heard, but isn't sure if the recommendations will fly with in the Legislature.
\
""He's quite right that the funding scheme we're dealing with right now was built for the 1950s,"" said Fischer, whose group represents environment and public health groups across the state.
\
""But we have a block of legislators who have made pledges against new taxes.""

By David Shepardson and Christina Rogers
\
The Detroit News
\
Detroit -- General Motors Co. CEO Dan Akerson wants the federal gas tax boosted as much as $1 a gallon to nudge consumers toward more fuel-efficient cars, and he's confident the government will soon shed its remaining 26 percent stake in the once-bankrupt automaker.
\
""I actually think the government will be out this year -- within the next 12 months, hopefully within the next six months,"" Akerson said in a two-hour interview with The Detroit News last week.
\
He is grateful for the government's rescue of GM -- ""I have nothing but good things to say about them"" -- but Akerson said the time for that relationship to end is coming because it's wearing on GM.
\
""It's kind of like your in-laws: It was a nice long weekend. We didn't say a week,"" Akerson said with a laugh.
\
And while he is eager to say goodbye to the government as a part owner of GM, Akerson would like to see it step up to the challenge of setting a higher gas tax, as part of a comprehensive energy policy.
\
A government-imposed tax hike, Akerson believes, will prompt more people to buy small cars and do more good for the environment than forcing automakers to comply with higher gas-mileage standards.
\
""There ought to be a discussion on the cost versus the benefits,"" he said. ""What we are going to do is tax production here, and that will cost us jobs.""
\
For the years 2017-25, federal officials are considering 3 percent to 6 percent annual fuel efficiency increases, or 47 mpg to 62 mpg. That could boost the cost of vehicles by up to $3,500.
\
""You know what I'd rather have them do -- this will make my Republican friends puke -- as gas is going to go down here now, we ought to just slap a 50-cent or a dollar tax on a gallon of gas,"" Akerson said.
\
""People will start buying more Cruzes and they will start buying less Suburbans.""
\
With gas already over $4 a gallon in parts of the country, a higher gas tax is a hard sell.
\
Rebecca Lindland, an analyst with IHS Global Insight, said higher gas taxes in Europe did lead consumers to buy more fuel-efficient cars.
\
But she acknowledged that's virtually impossible to see in the United States.
\
""It's career suicide for a politician to call for raising gas taxes,"" Lindland said.
\
Akerson isn't the first auto exec to float the idea of a gas tax to encourage consumers to buy fuel-efficient vehicles. Ford Chairman Bill Ford Jr. has previously advocated a gas tax increase.
\
On Monday, a Ford spokeswoman said the company ""will leave the policy decision to Congress""; in 2009, GM CEO Rick Wagoner called a higher gas tax ""worthy of consideration.""
\
Stock boost sought
\
Akerson believes the Treasury's continued ownership stake in GM -- 500 million shares -- is dragging down its stock price, which has fallen 23 percent this year, and closed Monday at $28.56. That's well below the $33-per-share it fetched in November's $23 billion initial public stock offering.
\
""I think that it is an overhang -- to have 500 million shares sitting out there -- it's a problem,"" Akerson said, adding that unrest in the Middle East and oil prices also are depressing GM's share price. ""They don't know when (the Treasury is) going to come out. Investors hate uncertainty.""
\
David Whiston, an auto analyst at Morningstar, agrees that government ownership is impacting investors' interest in GM.
\
""There are a lot of money managers that are waiting for the government to exit before jumping in,"" Whiston said.
\
The Treasury, which rescued GM with a $49.5 billion bailout and once held a 61 percent majority stake, ""will likely look at another (stock) sale in August, after second-quarter earnings are announced, Akerson said.
\
The Obama administration has made clear it is eager to exit GM -- but hasn't laid out a precise timetable.
\
Asked if GM is considering buying back its stock, Akerson paused for eight seconds before declining to answer directly. ""But we have a lot of cash,"" he added.
\
At the current stock price, U.S. taxpayers would be out more than $12 billion on GM's bailout. Still, Akerson believes that, in the end, taxpayers will see the government made the right call in saving the automaker, as well as crosstown rival Chrysler.
\
""We are in the midst of transforming an iconic American company so 20 and 30 years from now (taxpayers) will look at this company and they'll say, 'Absolutely it was the right thing to do,'"" Akerson said. ""And it shouldn't be measured on did it sell for $43 or $53 (a share) or did they lose a couple billion dollars?""
\
GM was saved, he said, because of the extreme generosity of Americans -- a spirit that helped restore Europe and Japan after World War II and rebuild cities such as New Orleans after natural disasters.
\
""We're the most generous country, even in terrible times,"" Akerson said. ""We don't walk to the disaster as a nation. ... We can't wait to help.""
\
Things are looking up for GM's image, he said. Pollster Peter Hart, conducting research for GM, found 16 percent had a positive view of GM before the bailout. But that had risen to 65 percent early this year, Akerson said.
\
""I couldn't believe the press we got on the IPO -- it was like a $100 million gift,"" Akerson said.
\
GM's rebound, he believes, was a ""proxy"" for the U.S.
\
""OK, we took the blow as a nation, we weathered the worst, and my God, we're back,"" Akerson said. ""It's why I came here. It was a story of underdog that tripped as we all have in our lives -- it was a good feel-good story.""
\
Call for tax hikes
\
In his interview with The News, Akerson also weighed in on the nation's debt ceiling, saying Congress should raise it from its current $14.3 trillion mark. The government could default on its debt on Aug. 2.
\
""We're too good a nation to let ourselves be a banana republic,"" Akerson said, warning that a default would be ""unimaginable"" and could hurt auto sales.
\
But he agrees with those who say the country has been spending money it can't afford.
\
""Now, we need practical decisions,"" Akerson said. ""I think you need to cut the hell out of the budget and you've got to increase taxes ... on everybody -- including the middle class and the rich people.""
\
Akerson, who describes himself as ""a Colin Powell Republican -- not a Sarah Palin Republican"" -- said President Barack Obama has ""done a pretty good job on the economy,"" which, he said, was ""a nightmare.
\
""I don't think he can fix it in four years and I think we just have to stay the course,"" he said.
\
Despite his Republican stripes, Akerson is frustrated with the political climate and the media.
\
He was invited to appear on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" but said: ""I can't go on it. I'm toxic. I'm like a lightning rod. I couldn't have an intelligent discussion without someone saying, 'He's a welfare guy from the bailout.'""
\
But he noted the bipartisan spirit of GM's rescue and the rest of the U.S. auto industry.
\
""If we had gone down,"" he said, ""the supply chain would have gone down. ... And Ford was hanging on by its fingernails, too.""
\
GM's failure also would have led to Detroit's collapse, Akerson said. ""I have not seen a city in this bad a shape since I went to East Berlin in 1969.""

Tech investment
\
General Motors said Monday it will invest $130 million to consolidate global data operations to its technical center in Warren.
\
The company said the move will create 25 jobs. GM will renovate an administrative building to house the company's computer infrastructure. The automaker said the center will help it keep pace as computers are used more to design vehicles and for safety, fuel economy and other functions.
\
The project is part of a $2 billion investment announced last month at 17 GM facilities in eight states.

The governor keeps pushing for more gas tax funds to build our roads.
\
During the summer of 2008, the Department of Transportation paved M-79 from Charlotte west to M-66. This asphalt paving should last 15 to 20 years.
\
I recently drove over this section of road. The road looks like it is 20 years old already. Sections of the pavement have popped out. There are cracks everywhere. I really doubt if it would make it through another winter.
\
And the road is not yet a year old.
\
Is this the kind of work we can expect if a gas tax increase is pushed through?

Izzo is 'lifeblood'
\
I'm sure some of you heard the comments by analysts during the Michigan State-Kansas game about Tom Izzo not feeling appreciated and going elsewhere.
\
I do not believe this is true, but I think anyone who watches MSU owes Izzo a sincere thank you.
\
Izzo has turned our sleepy little community into a college basketball mecca. I, and many others, crave the doldrums of the winter, watching our team fight their way through the Big Ten, all in anticipation of warm March days and thrills.
\
If you are a hard-core fan, a casual fan or any fan of our school, write another letter here.
\
Let's let Izzo know we appreciate him; let him know that what he does is the lifeblood of our community.

Protest Mason bridge plan
\
I was recently stunned to learn about the city of Mason's intention to blow the entire street maintenance budget for two-plus years on a new road and bridge.
\
The proposed roadway would cross Willow Creek, connecting Franklin Farm Drive to Kipp Road. It is projected to cost well over $1 million.
\
Given the road's location, it would serve only a handful of residents and is of no benefit to the vast majority of Mason residents.
\
Because the roadway is positioned in the worst location available, it will require extensive floodplain and wetland fill, increasing the project's cost and damage to the environment.
\
To add insult to injury, the city has less damaging options that would achieve the same objectives at virtually no cost.
\
For some reason, however, Mason officials insist that this project is essential and more important than repairing our crumbling streets.
\
I would encourage all residents to contact the city of Mason in writing or at (517) 676-9155 to voice their opinion regarding our own little ""Bridge to Nowhere"" project.

U.S. needs more nukes
\
Barack Obama is going to stand up in front of all Americans and claim that by destroying all of our nuclear weapons the world will be a safer place. In the perfect world, this would be the case.
\
But, you have to use common sense when it comes to dealing with terrorists and communist countries.
\
I know for a fact that North Korea, China, Russia, Pakistan and al-Qaida extremists will not reason with the United States.
\
Our stockpile of nuclear weapons ended the Cold War and prevented World War III. In fact, we need to build more. Russia has 5,000 more nukes than we do. If they decide to drop one on us, it will be no more America, no more freedom.

Over-rule insurers
\
What is more important: Americans' access to health care or insurance companies' profits? AIG executives' greed pales beside the greed of health insurance executives.
\
Private insurers object to any efficient Medicare-style government program for all Americans because it would control costs and compete too effectively with private companies (LSJ, April 7).
\
It is outrageous to consider rejecting quality low-cost health care for all Americans just because insurance companies object. Why should we all pay more for health care and for insurance, just to protect private insurance profits?
\
How can health insurance lobbyists ask Congress to require inefficiencies in new Medicare-style health insurance, to match the inefficiencies in private insurance?
\
How can insurance lobbyists argue with a straight face against controlling health care costs?
\
People in Michigan want dependable access to quality health care at reasonable cost. Congress must include a strong public program among our health insurance choices.
\
Will Congress again protect and enrich private insurance companies? Or will Congress listen this time to their human constituents?

Liberals need help
\
Since many liberal letter writers seem to have missed some news:
\
George Bush is no longer president. Rush Limbaugh never was president.
\
Bush and John McCain called for a new regulatory department in treasury to oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003 and 2006. Democrats Barney Frank and Barack Obama (in 2006) said not to worry, everything was OK.
\
Banking deregulation started under Bill Clinton with Obama's current advisers, Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers.
\
While Obama slams Bush's policies and actions in every speech, both here and abroad, he maintains many of the same policies.
\
While pledging not to increase taxes on the poor, he signed into law the $.62/pack cigarette tax increase that is really a poor tax, not a sin tax. And, he asks for a CO2 cap and trade law that is nothing more than an energy tax designed to fund his liberal agenda.
\
The scientific consensus on global warming is shifting to one of CO2 not being a significant issue and that man has not caused global warming.

114,"WASHINGTON - The Washington Auto Show doesn't have the cachet of Detroit, and often not even the same vehicles that were introduced in the Motor City just a week ago.\But governmental decision makers who passed through the Washington Convention Center heard a series of environmental pitches Wednesday from the U.S. auto industry and a phrase that has almost become extinct in the nation's capital: tax increase.\The head of the nation's largest car dealership chain said Americans would support far higher gasoline taxes if the money were spent on reducing U.S. energy imports.\Since October, AutoNation Chairman and CEO Mike Jackson has called for a gas tax increase of as much as $1 per gallon - offset with credits for low-income drivers - to push American car buyers toward more fuel-efficient vehicles.\In a panel on energy issues at the Washington Auto Show, Jackson said, while he is concerned about a consumer backlash, company research found that 60% of buyers would be willing to pay those taxes if they were a part of an energy independence policy.\Jackson said such taxes are necessary because market forces won't demand higher fuel economy otherwise. Despite record fuel prices last summer, he said, fuel economy ranks just above cup holders in terms of consumer demands for new vehicles.\""The American consumer is fairly sophisticated, and going off to war for oil every 10 or 15 years is not where they want to be,"" Jackson said.\In other developments:\*General Motors Corp. decided not to bring its Camaro concept to the show, but it did have a new hybrid vehicle to tout, one that seats 41 people.\The company announced the first delivery of a hybrid bus to Washington's transit authority, part of 216 buses set to be delivered to six cities this year. Through a partnership with bus maker New Flyer, GM has about 380 hybrid buses on the road.\Like smaller hybrids, the GM diesel-powered bus hybrids get better fuel economy, about 20% to 40% according to New Flyer. They also produce far better emissions than conventional diesel buses, reducing some pollutants by up to 90%.\GM estimates that each bus can save more than 1,500 gallons of fuel a year, which it notes is far more than the typical passenger car hybrids that some automotive companies have become so popular for building.\*Speaking of hybrids and hype, Ford Motor Co. will give its Escape Hybrid sport-utility vehicle a starring role in a Super Bowl XL commercial.\Ford spokesman Jon Harmon said an ad featuring the Escape Hybrid and a ""new spokesperson"" will run during game time Feb. 5. He declined to dole out more specifics.\Ad experts estimate ABC is charging $2.5 million for a 30-second spot. Of course, Ford doesn't have to pay to have the name Detroit's Ford Field, mentioned repeatedly to some 100 million viewers for free.\*General Motors said Wednesday that it would open an aggressive marketing campaign to highlight its vehicles capable of running on ethanol blends, hoping to drive public awareness of the fuel made from corn.\The campaign, called Live Green Go Yellow, will be unfurled during next month's Winter Olympics and tout the benefits of E85 vehicles. The vehicles can run on fuel that has 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, reducing the dependence on foreign oil and helping Midwest farmers.\GM will offer nine models with E85 capability this year, bringing an additional 400,000 of the vehicles into its fleet.\About 1.5 million GM vehicles in the market currently have E85 capability, including the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon.\Ford plans to produce 250,000 ethanol-capable vehicles this year, including the Ford F-150 pickup truck, Ford Crown Victoria, the Mercury Grand Marquis and the Lincoln Town Car.\""The American consumer is fairly sophisticated, and going off to war for oil every 10 or 15 years is not where they want to be.""

115,"""Right now, we have crumbling bridges with hundreds of temporary supports holding them up. Buses of school kids\and families travel over them — and under them. Chunks of concrete have slammed through windshields.""\Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, saying in her State of the State address in February that we can't forget about the bridges\Michigan's bridges are in such bad shape — more than one in 10 are rated poor — that fixing them at the current pace could take an estimated 92 years. As of 2018, there were 62 bridges around the state that were actually closed to traffic, including 13 in Wayne County. Overall, it's a nightmarish portrait that requires attention.\""There's plenty of opportunity if you have some information to point your finger here or there or somewhere else,"" said Bill Heil, 77, who lives on Grosse Ile, a Wayne County community on the Detroit River beset by bad bridges. ""The real question is, where do we go from here? We need a bridge fix.""\Michigan's new governor, who made fixing ""the damn roads"" a rallying point of her campaign, said in her State of the State address in February that we can't forget about the bridges.\""Right now, we have crumbling bridges that have hundreds of temporary supports holding them up. I want you to think about buses of kids and families traveling over those bridges — or under them,"" Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said. ""Chunks of concrete, slamming through windshields.""\The governor's assessment was not hyperbole. Our problem is that serious.\You can blame the weather. Moreso, you should blame the funding, which is tied to state transportation spending. Michigan, historically, has not put enough money into fixing its bridges.\In 2015, Michigan ranked 42nd nationwide for road spending for every 10,000 vehicle miles traveled, according to the Citizens Research Council of Michigan. Spending has gotten more generous since, but we are still below the national average.\Meanwhile, the latest figures show the number of bridges in good condition across our state began plunging in 2015 after years of being fairly stable. Across the state, 11% of bridges were in poor or worse condition in 2018 compared with 8% nationwide.\Here's more bad news: Unless a fix comes soon, our bridges are likely to get even worse — fast.\Federal regulations require inspections at least once every two years of all bridges longer than 20 feet on public roads, more frequently for seriously deteriorating bridges. Counties, cities and villages own a majority — 59% — of the 11,000-plus bridges in Michigan. The Michigan Department of Transportation owns most of the rest and roughly three-quarters of those bridges are associated with freeways.\Bridges are very costly and really can affect the budget, said Tom Bruff, transportation manager at the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments.\Taking intermediate steps to slow deterioration such as putting weight restrictions on a bridge can help, Bruff said.\""But eventually that's going to impact things,"" he said.\Bridges that are closed or restricted for weight can affect things like garbage pickup or, worse, the flow of first responders or people driving to hospitals.\In 2018 there were more than 500 bridges across Michigan in poor condition that have posted weight limits for vehicles passing over them.\Matt Chynoweth, director of MDOT's bridge program, said restricting bridge weights does not mean they're dangerous.\""The reason that we post a bridge, it doesn't mean that if a big truck were to go across it the bridge would fail. What it means is that repeated big trucks going over it will reduce the service life of a bridge,"" Chynoweth said.\Across the U.S., Michigan ranked 10th in 2018 for the highest percentage of bridges in poor condition. Among Great Lakes states, only Pennsylvania had a higher percentage. In Ohio and Indiana, just 6% were rated poor. Minnesota had the best bridges, where 5% were rated poor.\Money is probably the biggest issue. But you can thank Mother Nature, too.\Habib Tabatabai, professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, said battling our winters takes a toll on bridges, and more needs to be done to preserve our bridges that are in better condition.\""The northern United States in general and the Midwest in particular have some of the harshest environments for bridges because they are exposed to the environment directly and they are exposed to traffic and most importantly the use of deicing salts, which can do, over long term, tremendous ... unavoidable damage to structures,"" Tabatabai said.\All parts of a bridge are susceptible to age and weather.\A bridge listed in poor condition does not necessarily mean it is unsafe — but it does indicate the bridge needs attention. In order to be rated poor, at least one component of the bridge — such as its deck, substructure or superstructure — will have a rating of 4 or less on a 0-9 scale. If the structure is a culvert and more than 20 feet in length it receives one rating.\To help extend the life of a bridge in good or fair condition, the Federal Highway Administration's bridge preservation guidelines outline the importance of preventive maintenance like cleaning the bridge and joints, along with deck sealing to help slow the deterioration of concrete and steel.\""The payoff in extending the service life of a bridge structure is far higher than demolishing and building a new one,"" said Tabatabai. One of the important things sometimes neglected is to ""take maintenance and prevention steps from day one, when you open the bridge to traffic.""\The deck of the bridge is not the only part that needs to be protected from the elements. Other areas are subject to splashes from deicing salt, too.\""If you are traveling under a bridge, let's say a snow plow takes the material that has salt in it and splashes on the columns of the bridge above ... they start to rust and when they rust they start to expand and causes cracking and spalling,"" Tabatabai said.\According to MDOT, the total cost to replace Michigan's roughly 1,200 bridges that are in poor or worse condition is about $3.4 billion — of which $1.5 billion is needed for state-owned bridges and $1.9 billion for those owned by local agencies. The costs are limited to the physical parts of the bridge and do not include a long list of items also necessary, such as engineering and design, demolition and lighting.\Those costs also do not include funds to maintain or rehabilitate bridges not yet listed in poor condition.\At the current pace — without an infusion of cash — fixing our bridges will take roughly 92 years, said Alison Black, chief economist for the American Road & Transportation Builders Association.\On top of these challenges, costs have risen dramatically over the last two decades.\""Everything is up,"" said MDOT'S Chynoweth. ""It's the materials, but then also think about the labor, health insurance rates have gone up, liability, pension liabilities. You name it. It's everything.""\Aging bridges also contribute to increased costs. The average Michigan bridge was built in 1973 — 46 years ago. If you calculate a bridge's age by the last date of major rehabilitation, the average Michigan bridge is 36 years old.\""As they get older, they require more vigilant attention, just as people get older you have to take care of your health more,"" said Jerome Lynch, professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.\There are more than 700 bridges in Michigan that have not had any rehabilitation in at least 75 years, according to a Free Press analysis of state data. Most, three out of four, are locally owned.\Bridge funding is tied to state transportation spending and Michigan's has been low when it comes to spending per capita.\On top of that, as part of transportation spending, Michigan allocates a smaller piece of that pie to bridges. Between 2014 and 2017, Michigan's overall transportation contract awards devoted just 20% to bridges.\Ohio earmarked 26%, New York, 57%, with the national average 27%, according to Black of the American Road and Transportation Builders Association.\MDOT's budget for bridges has hovered around $200 million annually for the last two decades.\""It becomes a function of the same funding levels for 20 years and the expectation that those funding levels can buy what they did 20 years ago, "" Chynoweth said.\Even with the thrifty historical spending on bridges, over the last two years, Michigan's overall transportation budget has been the highest on record, according to the Senate Fiscal Agency.\The transportation budget's growth from $3.9 billion in fiscal year 2015-16 to $5 billion this year is the result of a road funding package successfully pushed by the administration of then-Gov. Rick Snyder. The road funding package called for an additional $1.2 billion for Michigan's transportation budget by fiscal year 2020-21.\Republicans and Democrats agree it's still not enough.\But plans to address that in the upcoming annual budget are at a standoff. The Republican-controlled Legislature has turned up its nose to Whitmer's proposed 45-cent gas tax increase; the Democratic governor maintains she will veto any budget that doesn't include more money for roads and bridges.\A proposal currently in the Michigan Senate puts next year's transportation budget at $5.1billion.\The governor's road funding plan, with the extra money generated by the proposed gas tax hike, would put the transportation budget at $5.8 billion, according to a Senate Fiscal Agency analysis. MDOT, as part of her plan, wants to include additional money specifically for local bridges.\But that's a long way off.\When asked recently about Whitmer's plan, state Sen. Wayne Schmidt, R-Traverse City, said he prefers not to deal with additional revenue, at least for this budget year. Regarding new money, he said, ""It could happen next year.""\T.J. Bucholz, president and managing partner of Vanguard Public Affairs in Lansing, said we could be in for a long battle.\""The days right now of passing a budget in June as Gov. Snyder did when Republicans controlled every branch of government — that's over,"" Bucholz said.\""I think unless there's some massive sort of release of the logjam, I think that we are in for a long summer. ... The sad part about that is, that's another summer of citizens driving on dangerous roads and crumbling bridges.""\Local communities in 2018 had a higher percentage of bridges in poor condition compared with the state, 14% compared with 5%. And far less money to deal with them.\The main source of funding for local bridges are dollars from the Michigan Transportation Fund.\The fund, created by Public Act 51, is revenue raised primarily from motor fuel taxes and vehicle registration fees.\A formula determines how dollars are distributed.\Statewide, in fiscal year 2017, county road commissions in total received $900 million from Act 51. The share to cities and villages was about $450 million. These funds can be used for roads and bridges. In 2017, the latest data available, road commissions spent a paltry $42million from the fund on bridges, according to the Transportation Asset Management Council, a legislated body made up of transportation officials. Cities and villages spent just $15 million.\""Generally, the funding that we do receive like other agencies it comes as one lump funding. It doesn't say, 'Hey, you are going to put $50million toward the roads, $10 million toward your ditches and this much for your bridges,'"" said Beverly Watts, director of public works for Wayne County. She says they have budgeted about $10 million each year for bridges since 2017. In fiscal year 2017, Wayne received $77million in Act 51 funds.\Another way to fix local bridges in poor condition is the state's Local Bridge Program, which is funded through one-half cent of the current gas tax. Local communities and counties with bridges put together applications to the state for funding for bridge projects, including maintenance, that typically cost no more than $5 million. The program requires local communities to pay toward their project, including at least 5% of the construction costs, and limits the number of applications yearly to five per locale. With the exception of last year, the fund has been relatively flat at $48 million.\The fund received 427 applications last year that would have cost $308 million. In the end, 105 bridge projects were selected to receive a total of $53 million.\One piece of Whitmer's budget proposal calls for an increase in the amount of money dedicated to local bridges. Specifically, the Local Agency Bridge Bundling Program would generate $85 million annually through a dedicated 4 cent gas tax, which, if approved, may result in bonding of up to $1 billion — enough to address all of the locally owned serious or critical bridges in the state by 2025, according to MDOT.\The idea is similar to one MDOT started in the early 2000s to fix up its own bad bridges.\MDOT says it would partner with the local agencies to streamline designs and reduce overall engineering and administrative costs. It cites similar bridge bundling projects as success stories in Missouri, Pennsylvania and New York.\Last December, the County Road Association of Michigan voted unanimously in support of the program.\Bridges do fail.\Last month in Chattanooga, Tennessee, a large concrete section of a bridge on I-75 crashed onto the road below, injuring a motorist. That bridge had been rated in fair condition prior to the accident.\In Minneapolis, Minnesota, the I-35W Mississippi River bridge carrying eight lanes of traffic during rush hour collapsed in 2007, killing 13 people and injuring 145.\Whitmer's comments about bridges during her State of the State address weren't hypothetical. In the photo near the top of this report, that's a real bus from Dearborn Public Schools, crossing an actual bridge held up with temporary supports.\It's the Miller Road bridge, which is owned by Wayne County and carries traffic into the Ford Rouge plant in Dearborn. This bridge would be a candidate for the program the governor proposes, according to newly appointed state Transportation Director Paul Ajegba. The bridge is currently rated in poor condition and has more than 400 temporary supports holding it together.\""Can you imagine that bridge being shut down — the impact not just on Ford but the state as a whole?"" Ajegba asked. The cost to fix the bridge ranges from $40 million to $50 million, roughly the same size of the Local Bridge Program's current annual budget.\""We have three projects that we need to do now,"" Wayne County Executive Warren Evans said during his State of the County speech in March, according to a transcript. ""The collective cost of those three projects is a hundred million dollars. ... You don't get that out of your yearly allocation of 51 road funds. We have to have an influx of cash to allow that to happen.""\Ken Sikkema, a retired Republican legislator who is in a bipartisan group advocating for a higher gas tax for roads and bridges, said fix bridges now or fix them later at an even higher cost.\""They deteriorate year by year, that's sort of what's unique and important about this debate is whether it's bridges or roads, the longer you wait, the more expensive it gets.""

116,"On Wednesday, Gov. Jennifer Granholm will make the last State of the State address of her 4-year term.\Today, the Free Press examines what the governor faced on several key issues when she took office in January 2003, and how she and the Legislature have dealt with them. For more, see story on Page 1A.\ISSUE: MEDICAID\*What the governor inherited: Medicaid was an expanding burden, consuming about a fourth of state's general fund budget.\*What she said/did in 2003: She said medical care for elderly and poor people should be a top priority.\*What has happened since: Medicaid increased by $570 million, to $2.8 billion. The state has done little to address one of the fastest-growing demands: long-term care for elderly people in nursing homes. Money from a 2004 cigarette tax increase was largely earmarked for Medicaid.\*What she's saying now: She's angry about proposed federal Medicaid cuts to states.\*What's likely to happen: Medicaid costs could jump $400 million by 2007. Republicans are to propose requirements that Medicaid recipients quit smoking and eat healthier. No proposal from the governor.\Chris Christoff\ISSUE: ROADS\*What the governor inherited: A 1997 state gas-tax increase led to record road funding to help make strides in fixing freeways.\*What she said/did in 2003: She announced she was deferring all road expansion to meet an Engler-era goal of having 90% of Michigan roads in good condition by 2007.\*What has happened since: Doubts remain about whether the 90% goal can be met. The governor and GOP lawmakers, concerned that congestion would stifle economy, opted to restore half of the 34 deferred projects.\*What she's saying now: Last year, she accelerated more than $500 million in roadwork to stimulate the economy.\*What's likely to happen: Metro Detroit may have $30 billion in road needs in next 25 years; there is little appetite in Lansing for another gas-tax increase.\Matt Helms\ISSUE: THE BUDGET DEFICIT\*What the governor inherited: A $920-million budget deficit.\*What she said/did in 2003: She partly blamed tax cuts in previous years for the shortfall. She called for suspending scheduled cuts in the state income tax and Single Business Tax. She balanced the budget without a general tax hike.\*What has happened since then: In 2004, a scheduled partial rollback of the income tax rate was halted for six months. The cigarette tax went up 75 cents a pack. Counties got to collect annual taxes six months earlier to offset their loss in state revenue sharing.\In 2005, Granholm proposed cutting the Single Business Tax, largely for manufacturers, while raising the tax on insurance companies. The plan faltered, but in December, she agreed with lawmakers to reduce the personal property tax on businesses.\*What she's said since then: Further budget cuts could erode education spending and state services.\*What she's saying now: More tax cuts must be accompanied by state budget cuts.\*What's likely to happen: Senate Republicans led calls last week for a tax cut for small businesses. She is likely to resist as the state faces yet another deficit for the 2006-07 fiscal year. Republicans will continue calls for more business tax cuts, saying it will stimulate the economy.\Chris Christoff\ISSUE: EDUCATION\*What the governor inherited: A $360-million deficit in the School Aid Fund.\*What she said/did in 2003: She vowed to protect K-12 funding, and in her first budget proposal (in March 2003), she kept per-pupil funding at the previous year's level - $6,700; funding for adult education was cut by about two-thirds.\*What has happened since then: She continued to protect K-12 school funding, but she and the Legislature cut university aid by 14%, then some schools raised tuition. In 2004, funding in the state's wealthiest districts was cut by $74 per pupil. In 2005, a $175-per-pupil increase was passed.\*What she's saying now: The governor said last week that she wants all K-12 public schools to get an immediate funding increase of $25 per pupil. She says she opposes an effort by the K-16 Coalition for Michigan's Future that guarantees annual state spending increases to keep up with inflation. *What's likely to happen: Expect wrangling over the coalition's effort.\Lori Higgins and Chris Christoff\ISSUE: THE ENVIRONMENT\*What the governor inherited:\A legacy of gentle oversight of industry and other pollution-producers, whose free-market philosophy eschewed many of the regulatory protections for the state's natural resources that environmentalists view as critical.\*What she said/did in 2003: She promised to restore the Department of Environmental Quality's powers, to reduce the state's mercury emissions from power plants, a cleanup of Dow Chemical Co.'s dioxin pollution near Midland, new protection for Michigan's water and land-use reform.\*What has happened since then: She has tackled the issues, she said she would, and been a breath of fresh air to an environmental community grown weary of war with Engler. But because of distractions, such as a moribund economy and other political realities, she hasn't pursued the issues with the fervor many had hoped. Uneasiness grows that Granholm's governance by collaboration and consensus aren't sufficient to tackle environmental issues with entrenched and powerful interests.\*What she's saying now: Her language is careful on most environmental issues, with occasional exceptions. Aides say that she is still working to resolve tough issues such as dioxin and mercury.\*What's likely to happen: She is unlikely to unveil major environmental initiatives, which could be criticized as harpooning economic development.\Hugh McDiarmid Jr.\ILLUSTRATION: February 2005 photo by AL GOLDIS Associated Press;Photo ERIC SEALS Detroit Free Press;Photo J.

117,"LANSING – Just recently, officials in Roscommon County in northern Michigan were finalizing the 2020 budget and worrying over about how to erase a projected $200,000 deficit.\But that was before Monday, when Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued 147 line-item vetoes and killed a range of payments affecting the county general fund, the sheriff's patrol, and the jail, among other areas.\Now Roscommon, which has 24,000 residents and a budget of just over $9 million, is looking at an $800,000 shortfall.\""There is definitely going to be a reduction in staff, if this thing sticks,"" Robert Schneider, chairman of the county board of commissioners, said Friday.\Schneider, a Democrat and retired supermarket manager who is in his 13th year on the county board, said the only saving grace for Roscommon is that, unlike many other counties, its fiscal year does not start until Jan.1. He hopes that allows time for resolution of the budget impasse between Whitmer, also a Democrat, and Republican legislative leaders.\""As it stands right now, I'd probably put it on the governor,"" Schneider said when asked where he places the blame. ""They did have (the funds) in there and she's the one who cut it out. Nobody else did that.""\As Michigan's political leaders gauge the reaction to Monday's historic use of the governor's veto pen and pundits wonder who will blink first, Schneider and tens of thousands of others around the state, suddenly and unexpectedly affected by the budget fight, can only hope that both sides are willing to move and force a resolution.\""We're at the mercy of the state,"" he said.\Whether they place the blame mostly with Whitmer, as Schneider does, or with House Speaker Lee Chatfield, R-Levering, and Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, as Whitmer and many Democrats do, remains to be seen.\Where that blame is placed will likely impact how this ends.\For now, most analysts say it is Whitmer who will take most of the heat. But they say that could change over time because only an act of the Legislature — not the governor acting alone — can reverse the cuts.\To briefly recap, Whitmer campaigned on a pledge to ""fix the damn roads,"" won with 53% of the vote, and built her first budget around a 45-cent-per-gallon increase in the state fuel tax. Central to that plan was that it would not only increase annual road funding by $1.9 billion, but it would allow the state to stop spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year on roads that Whitmer said should instead be spent on other priorities, such as education and the environment.\Whitmer spent months touring the state to sell her vision, but the gas tax proposal never caught on. Republicans never made a public counter-offer. Whitmer, who had pledged to veto any budget that did not include a comprehensive road funding plan, retreated on that pledge Sept. 9, to head off a government shutdown. But budget talks broke off a few days later. Whitmer said GOP leaders would not withdraw an ""ultimatum"" about continuing to use general fund dollars to pay for roads, and she promised vetoes and other executive actions if they followed through.\Last Monday and Tuesday, after only receiving most of the budgets the previous  Friday, Whitmer used line-item vetoes to cut $947million from the $59 billion budget and used State Administrative Board powers to shift more than $600 million within 13 state departments. She also declared unconstitutional or otherwise unenforceable 72 boilerplate items that set conditions or gave direction on how certain money could be spent.\She declared the budgets ""a mess,"" and said her actions were needed to protect public health and safety in areas such as prisons, Medicaid and cybersecurity. The cuts, many of which appeared targeted at Republican causes and districts, eliminated the Pure Michigan tourism campaign and scholarships for private colleges while also hitting charter schools, rural hospitals, county road patrols, and funding for autism services, among others. Despite her emphasis on infrastructure, she vetoed $375million in general fund money allocated for roads and bridges, saying it was a Band-Aid fix that would cost the state more in the long run, while hurting other priorities.\Other vetoes canceled spending of $16 million for career and technical education equipment, $40 million in payments to hospitals, and millions more in rate increases for pediatric psychiatrists, neonatologists, and private duty nurses. Whitmer also cut $10 million from the Rural Jobs and Capital Investment Fund, $3 million for the Michigan Animal Agriculture Alliance, $1 million for county fairs and exhibitions, and $500,000 for the Farm Stress Program.\""I know there are things they care about in this budget that are no longer a reality,"" Whitmer said in calling on Republicans to negotiate a supplemental spending bill.\The response from Chatfield and Shirkey?\""The budget is done.""\Who is to blame for the impasse?\On the governor's side of the ledger:\Michigan is recognized as one of the most politically gerrymandered states in the nation, and Whitmer, who received more votes than any previous candidate for governor in state history, believes she has a strong mandate to follow through on her campaign promises.\The Republicans promised a summer road funding plan and never produced one.\At least some of Whitmer's criticisms of the budget approved by the Legislature are valid. For example, Republicans, who earlier introduced new and controversial work requirements for Medicaid recipients, did not follow through by including money to inform affected people about the changes and help them find jobs.\Supplemental appropriation bills are passed every year. To the extent any of the line-item vetoes should be reversed, only an act of the Legislature will accomplish that.\On the Republican side:\The state constitution grants exclusively to the Legislature the power to appropriate public funds\Whitmer ""walked away from the table"" during budget negotiations.\Whitmer built the budget around a proposed 45-cent gas tax increase that never won popular support. During the 2018 campaign, she dismissed as ""ridiculous"" the idea that she would propose a gas tax hike less than half that large.\Many of her cuts are aimed at Republican causes and districts, arguably treating citizens who benefit from the impacted services as pawns in a political chess match over which they have no control.\""This is a monumental mistake on her part,"" said Republican pollster Steve Mitchell. ""She clearly underestimated and miscalculated what Mike Shirkey and Lee Chatfield would do"" — which he said is essentially, nothing.\Republican lawmakers are ""beyond mad"" that Whitmer targeted rural areas and services, Mitchell said. But when they get complaints, they will explain that their budget funded those areas, and Whitmer removed the money. ""Here is her number; please call her,"" Mitchell said they will say.\Mitchell said he believes that just as Whitmer vetoed $600,000 for traffic control at Michigan International Speedway because it's in Shirkey's district, she vetoed more than $1.1million in autism services because Chatfield has a child and a sister with autism.\Gideon D'Assandro, a spokesman for Chatfield, did not answer directly when asked whether Chatfield felt his family was targeted by the autism vetoes.\""He thinks it's wrong to use any of these groups — students, veterans, drivers, people with autism — as political pawns to get her pet projects and a gas tax hike,"" D'Assandro said.\Whitmer said Friday it's a ""lazy analysis"" to say her cuts were aimed at Republican causes and districts. She had to make hard choices and there were multiple reasons for each of the cuts, she said. Spokeswoman Tiffany Brown declined comment on whether Chatfield's family was targeted by the autism vetoes, suggesting the question was not worthy of a response.\Adrian Hemond, the Democratic partner and CEO of the bipartisan Lansing consulting firm Grassroots Midwest, views the situation completely differently than Mitchell.\""There have been plenty of mistakes on the executive and legislative side, but the great balance of the mistakes resides with the Legislature,"" Hemond said.\By pushing Whitmer to exercise the full extent of her executive powers, despite warnings, Chatfield and Shirkey have forever changed the way state budgets are prepared, with the Legislature only able to dictate how much each state department will receive, and the governor free to move funds at will within each department, he said.\Hemond, who agreed Republican causes and districts were targeted in Whitmer's cuts, said that's why ""Republican lawmakers are going to be under a lot of pressure back home to come back to the table,"" once the impact of the cuts begins to sink in.\Whitmer is not on the ballot again until 2022, but Republicans will feel the sting of the budget impasse in the 2020 state House elections if they do not negotiate a budget fix, Hemond said.\The governor did not expect to get approval of a 45-cent gas tax hike, but that was an opening gambit for expected negotiations that never happened, Hemond said. One thing she should have done differently was to pivot sooner from trying to sell the gas tax plan to hammering Republicans for failing to come up with a plan of their own, he said.\John Truscott, CEO of the Lansing public relations firm Truscott Rossman and former press secretary to Republican Gov. John Engler, said that although the sides appear very far apart currently, he believes the situation is ""still salvageable"" if the governor and GOP leaders continue talking and work at gaining trust.\""When you are dealing with a budget, you don't walk away from the table,"" Truscott said in a criticism of Whitmer.\""Once you walk away from the table, you lose control of the process.""\That applies, he said, even if Whitmer is correct when she says that Republican leaders issued an ultimatum about using general fund money to pay for road repairs and were not truly negotiating.\""Take what you can get, and come back and get more next time,"" he said. ""She didn't do that. It was an all or nothing approach.""\It was also a mistake for Whitmer to initially say she would not sign a budget that did not include a comprehensive road funding plan, said Truscott, who believes Whitmer did the right thing in later retreating from that position.\""I think any time you issue ultimatums in a process like this ... that boxes you into a corner,"" he said.\For now, the pressure is ""on her,"" Truscott said, but ""I do think eventually pressure will go to the Legislature"" because ""they're the ones who are ultimately responsible"" for passing a supplemental spending bill.\Susan Demas, editor of the online political news site Michigan Advance, said it's unprecedented for the Legislature to send a governor a budget that has not been negotiated and she believes the fact Whitmer is a woman and the Republican leaders are men contributed to that.\Shirkey's constant references to Whitmer as ""my governor"" are weird and condescending, and Chatfield's recent comments that Whitmer should admit she made a mistake as a first step to any action on a supplemental spending bill reveals an interest in making the governor ""grovel"" and trying to ""show she has no idea what she is doing,"" despite the fact Whitmer has more legislative experience than either of the Republican leaders, Demas said.\Shirkey spokeswoman Amber McCann said he refers to Whitmer as ""my governor"" out of respect ""and to show a public embrace of the governor, regardless of their political or ideological differences."" D'Assandro said Chatfield was shocked that the items Whitmer requested in a supplemental ""had all of her pet projects and none of the terrible vetoes that have Michigan residents enraged.""\Lansing pollster Ed Sarpolus, executive director of Target-Insyght in Lansing and a former Democratic staffer, said he's not convinced Republicans are going to budge on the budget any time soon.\""The Republicans are kind of happy with what Gretchen did — it kind of fits with their plan,"" he said. ""They don't want her to succeed.""\He believes Republicans feel they are in a stronger position in the budget fight because they would rather ""eat the pain"" of public unhappiness over cuts and crumbling roads than give Whitmer a win.\""This is a blood sport — this is winner take all,"" he said.\Contact Paul Egan: 517-372-8660 or pegan@freepress.com.

118,"Regarding Gov. Rick Snyder's budget proposal calling for big gas tax and fee increases: What happened to the longstanding claim that Republicans were the anti-tax party?\I recall that when the oil companies first pushed prices above $3 and $4 a gallon during the Bush years, the Republicans called on then-Gov. Jennifer Granholm to suspend the gas tax whenever prices were above $3. Now prices remain above $3 all the time, and this governor is calling for higher taxes. His claim, ""You use the roads; you should pay for the roads,"" sounds to me like Snyder making the average citizen pay the extra cost again.\Oh, you might say businesses use the roads also and will pay these increases. However, some who use the roads the most, no doubt, will be able to write off the cost as an operating expense against their income tax and come out even.\The governor says that businesses should have tax parity with the individual taxpayer. Why not a dedicated increase on the income tax (individual and corporate) to fund road and bridge repairs only? This would lower the increase, spreading it across a much wider area -- not car and truck owners only.\If we will all share in the benefit, as Snyder says, we should all share in the cost, and that includes businesses.\Chuck Tindall,\Novi\State taxes high already\What is going on with Michigan?\(According to Jan. 1, 2012, information from the Tax Foundation) at 39.4 cents per gallon gas tax, Michigan has the fifth-highest state gas tax in the country -- and it will still have crummy roads. This increase will put Michigan at 53.4 cents and firmly in the No. 1 spot. New York will slip to the No. 2 spot with 49 cents per gallon.\Illinois, No. 7, is 38.9; Ohio, No. 20, is 28.0; and Wyoming is 14.0. What do these states know that Michigan doesn't? Looks like a lot.\Mike Masalin\Livonia\I've been retired for three years now. My small pension is now taxed, and my health care premiums have doubled since last year.

I encourage all members of the Legislature to back away from these ideas. Kentwood\A better plan\The three criteria I propose for a tax to support highway construction and repairs are these:\* The tax should be on users of the roads; they are the beneficiaries.\* The tax should be related to the miles driven and weights of the vehicles; these are the factors that impact wear on the roads.\* The tax should be related to inflation. This is to avoid the wasted energy of lawmakers reviewing the taxes needlessly every year, and to avoid our current problem of having income from fuel usage based on a static formula from 16 years ago.\The proposal: The tax should be based on the dollar consumption of gasoline or diesel fuel (or other fuels). It should be paid at the pump and built into the price displayed on the pump.\Perhaps there is some other plan needed for all-electric vehicles.\Paul A.

And none of these tax increases are temporary.\All of this is happening in an environment in which property values have plummeted. Either these factors weren't taken into consideration or they were considered and dismissed.\The governor claims he has a plan to reinvent Michigan.

\
$1.4B needed for roads
\
Southfield -- Michigan needs another $1.4 billion for roads annually, and Gov. Rick Snyder on Wednesday suggested hiking vehicle registration fees to help come up with the money.
\
In an address on infrastructure at Lawrence Technological University, the Republican governor said an extra $120 a year -- $10 a month -- on each registration would raise $1 billion a year. More money could be raised if voters approve allowing counties and regions to assess their own vehicle registration levies of up to $40 annually.
\
""Michigan's infrastructure is living on borrowed time,"" he said.
\
Snyder cautioned that the proposed $10 monthly fee is not finalized. ""I want a public discussion on these issues,"" he said. ""I'm not proposing anything specific to the Legislature.""
\
The $1.4 billion target is based on the findings of a House Republican road study released in September, but Snyder's strategy to reach that goal is expected to meet with resistance from Republicans who control the House and Senate and have vowed they will resist any tax increases.
\
The registration fee funding would be needed on top of revenues to be generated by a Snyder proposal to switch from a 19-cents-per-gallon retail gas tax to a tax on wholesale fuel prices. Revenues would be held at their current level by initially setting the wholesale fuel tax at 6.7 percent, Department of Transportation Director Kirk Steudle said later.
\
The proposals were part of a far-reaching strategy Snyder unveiled to stabilize transportation funding and improve Michigan's roads, public transit, Internet and sewer systems.
\
Among his ideas:
\
Rapid transit that would connect Detroit with its suburbs, Ann Arbor and Detroit Metropolitan Airport.
\
A new fiber optic cable across the Mackinac Bridge to increase Internet access in the Upper Peninsula.
\
Competitively bidding out maintenance services, engineering or construction of roads.
\
Accessing federal money for dredging ports around the state.
\
Helping communities maintain or improve water quality.
\
Giving counties the option to take over their road commissions, or consolidating local commissions. Snyder noted Michigan has 617 independent road agencies and 79 independent transit agencies.
\
""We are the only state in the country that has county road commissions -- 81 of them in total -- and 35 of those are not accountable to the rest of county government,"" he said.
\
Changing the way road money is distributed from the state to local governments so it's targeted to needs. Thirty-nine percent of state and federal road funds goes to the state, while 39 percent goes to county road commissions and 22 percent to cities and villages.
\
Surrounded by a half-dozen graphs and charts, Snyder said Michigan's infrastructure is deteriorating from a lack of investment, and state and local road programs are organized on an antiquated model devised when the Legislature wrote the state's main road act in 1951.
\
""It's wise to update things every 60 years, right?"" he quipped.
\
Snyder called for an end to county road commissions, which he said are ""unneeded"" -- a proposal that dovetailed with bipartisan legislation introduced Wednesday in the House that would allow county commissions to take over their road planning.
\
""The world has changed,"" Snyder said.
\
Snyder also put in a plug for a new bridge between Detroit and Windsor. The New International Trade Crossing suffered a setback in the Legislature last week when a Senate committee voted against legislation setting up a public-private authority to build and run the bridge.
\
Senate Majority Leader Randy Richardville of Monroe has said the issue is on hold until the end of the year at the earliest.
\
He also supported construction of a new Soo Lock to accommodate larger Lakes freighters.
\
Some cite plan's problems
\
Convincing Republicans in control of the House and Senate may prove challenging for the governor. Former Gov. Jennifer Granholm, a Democrat, had proposed a tax on the wholesale price of fuel, but the Legislature was cool to the idea.
\
State Rep. Rick Olson, R-Saline, co-chairman of the bipartisan House work group that reported the $1.4 billion shortage, said he supports Snyder's plan to change the way gas tax revenue is collected.
\
""The gas tax is insufficient and unreliable and, meanwhile, the cost of road construction and reconstruction is going up,"" Olson said following Snyder's talk.
\
But his Republican colleague, Sen. Tom Casperson of Escanaba, sees problems with the plan.
\
""The switch of the gas tax is concerning, just because nobody wants to come out swinging and say let's raise taxes,"" Casperson said.
\
Vehicle registrations are based on the value of the vehicle for models 1984 and newer; older vehicles are taxed on their weight. The Secretary of State's office estimates vehicle registration fees bring in about $950 million a year.
\
Franklin resident George Haddad nixed the idea of a county vehicle registration fee.
\
""My answer is 'no,'"" he said. ""I think they're trying to dissect the problem from the wrong end. There is still plenty of fat in the cumulative budgets ... rather than tax for more money.""
\
Mike Nystrom, executive vice president of the Michigan Infrastructure and Transportation Association, said his group is happy the governor offered long-term solutions to the state's infrastructure problems.
\
""We hope the House and Senate will follow the governor's bold leadership, and we look forward to working with the governor and Legislature to pass this long-awaited, long-term funding solution,"" he said in a statement.
\
Cutbacks hurt road funds
\
Jim Shea of P.K. Contracting, a Troy road-painting company, said he's ""energized"" by Snyder's plan.
\
""I think it's really great,"" said Shae, who attended the Snyder presentation. ""He's looking for input from every party and is interested in road construction.""
\
Michigan's road funds have declined as consumers have cut back on purchases due to gasoline prices spiking as high as $4 a gallon. A wholesale tax would allow revenues to rise or fall with changing fuel prices instead of tying gas tax revenue to consumption. Michiganians still would have to pay an 18-cent federal tax and a 6 percent Michigan sales tax on every gallon purchased.
\
Tim Fischer, deputy policy director with the Michigan Environmental Council, said he liked what he heard, but isn't sure if the recommendations will fly with in the Legislature.

""He's quite right that the funding scheme we're dealing with right now was built for the 1950s,"" said Fischer, whose group represents environment and public health groups across the state.

""But we have a block of legislators who have made pledges against new taxes.""

120,"LANSING – With just a week to spare, the Michigan Legislature finished work Tuesday on a $59.9 billion budget for the 2020 fiscal year that includes $120 million for water infrastructure improvements and treatment of PFAS and other contaminants in water systems across the state.\But the most controversial budget approved Tuesday in both the House of Representatives and Senate — the $5.3 billion transportation budget — puts an additional $400 million in general fund money into roads and bridges. That's on top of the $325million in income tax revenues that would have already gone to roads in 2020 under a 2015 road funding deal, which hiked fuel taxes and vehicle registration fees.\The budget now heads to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who called the budget ""a mess,"" and normally has 14 days to sign it, veto it, or use a line-item veto on selected items. The start of the next fiscal year on Oct. 1 effectively shortens the time the governor has to finalize the budget while avoiding a partial state government shutdown.\""This budget funds vital services while increasing funding for roads, schools and water protection without a massive $2.5 billion tax hike on Michigan's families,"" said Sen. Jim Stamas, R-Midland. ""We do not agree with the governor on a 45-cent (per gallon) gas tax hike.""\Democrats in the Republican-controlled Senate and House were united in their opposition to the plan, which they said didn't provide a long-term solution to Michigan's crumbling roads.\""Michigan has some of the worst roads in the country. That is abundantly clear to me when I make the long and treacherous drive once a month to Columbus, Ohio. And it's so clear because driving back into Michigan is like driving on rumble strips,"" said Sen. Adam Hollier, D-Detroit. ""And I think there is never a time when we want the Buckeyes to be better than us.""\In the House, which passed the budget on a party-line 58-51 vote, Rep. Leslie Love, D-Detroit, said, ""Fixing the roads and infrastructure is a matter of life and death. ... I'm sure the people are sick of the Legislature nickel and diming them. It's like putting Oil of Olay on the Wicked Witch's face.""\Whitmer's plan, which called for a 45-cent per gallon gas tax increase, would have stopped using general fund money to pay for roads, and instead directed those hundreds of millions of dollars annually to other priorities such as education and the environment. Once fully implemented, Whitmer's plan would have raised $2.5 billion a year through additional fuel taxes and increased road spending by $1.9 billion annually, with essentially all state money spent on roads coming from fuel taxes or vehicle registration fees.\The budget spells bad news for public transit in Michigan, said Clark Harder, executive director of the Michigan Public Transit Association. The Legislature cut capital funding by $10 million as transit agencies try to replace aging fleets, Harder said.\Operating funds were frozen at about $166million, despite the fact costs for fuel and other essentials are increasing, he said.\Harder said the budget leaves unappropriated about $27 million in funding that can only be spent on public transportation, meaning Michigan will lose the 5-1 federal spending match that goes with it.\Unless it is included in a supplemental appropriation, ""that money will go to other states,"" he said. Transit agencies ""will see some cuts coming, whether it's going to mean cut some staff or cut some routes.""\The GOP budget does give Whitmer some items she asked for related to roads, however:\$71 million to fix bridges on Miller Road and Rotunda Drive near the Ford Rouge plant in Dearborn\$18 million to fix a bridge, currently closed, on Spring Lake Road over Smith Bayou in Ferrysburg, on Ottawa County\$10 million to fix the North River Street Bridge in Harrison Township\$4 million to fix the Elm Street bridge over the Red Cedar River in Lansing\All four distressed bridges had been highlighted by Whitmer as she toured the state to sell her proposed gas tax increase.\A conference committee removed some controversial items from the transportation budget proposed by the House, such as taking a look at the sale of the Blue Water Bridge from Port Huron to Sarnia.\The budget includes language that could lead to the sale of other state assets. They include:\Soliciting proposals for the sale of two state-owned airports, one in Romeo and one in Linden.\Soliciting proposals for the sale of the state-owned rail line between Grayling and Gaylord. The line is operated by Lake State Railway Co. and is still in use.\Requiring the sale of one of the department's state-owned airplanes — a Cessna — plus any airplane that logged fewer than 50 flight hours the previous year.\The budget approved Tuesday also bars the state from awarding jobs to contractors who require union subcontractors.\The votes came after negotiations between the Republican leadership in the House and Senate and Whitmer broke down without an agreement. Many of the budgets received virtually no support from Democrats.\""This is unprecedented to have budgets being passed by one party and sent to the governor's desk with almost no negotiations,"" said Sen. Curtis Hertel, D-East Lansing, noting Whitmer has the option to veto entire budgets or line items. ""And I expect her to take strong actions and response.""\And in a statement released after the budget votes were done, Whitmer called the financial plans ""a mess.""\""After taking time off for a two-month summer vacation and a weekend getaway on Mackinac Island, Republicans are playing more shell games with the state budget so they can buy a phony talking point that they're spending record money on roads. ...

It also requires Attorney General Dana Nessel to report to the Legislature whenever she decides to sue the federal government.\The Great Lakes, Environment and Energy budget, which was one of the few budgets to receive unanimous support in the Senate. It includes $120 million for water infrastructure improvements and funding to help clean up PFAS and other contaminants in water systems around the state. ""Residents in my communities have grave concerns about the quality of our water. What happened in Flint is not an anomaly,"" said Sen. Mallory McMorrow, D-Royal Oak. ""This budget is a step in the right direction, to show that we're committed to water quality for all of our constituents.""\The Higher Education and Community Colleges budgets were passed, mostly along party lines, with increases of 0.9% for higher education and 0.8% for community colleges, despite Whitmer's proposal for a 3% increase for each.

123,"LANSING – Her first year in office began with a record cold snap that exposed a weakness in Michigan's energy grid.\It ended with sickly green liquid oozing onto a major freeway near Detroit, raising fresh worries about long-standing environmental failures now bubbling to the surface.\In between, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed into law bills intended to reduce Michigan's highest-in-the-nation auto insurance premiums, legalize internet gambling and sports betting, and reform the criminal justice system by raising from 17 to 18 the age at which accused offenders are routinely treated as adults.\But Whitmer fell far short of fulfilling her signature campaign pledge to ""fix the damn roads,"" ultimately approving a 2020 budget that allocated $375 million less to repair roads and bridges than the version recommended by the Republican-controlled Legislature.\Analysts' appraisals of Whitmer's 2019 performance vary widely. Some say Whitmer fared better than could be expected in advancing her priorities in the face of GOP opposition. Others view her handling of the state budget negotiations, in which she sought to pressure lawmakers by vetoing close to $1 billion in spending — not all of which has been restored — as disastrous. The most common view is somewhere in between.\But the events that bookended Whitmer's first year demonstrate how the governor in many ways spent the year responding to crises — including crumbling roads — that predate her administration. What she does in 2020 to shape events and circumstances while confronting new challenges may prove a more instructive test.\Those tests include whether she can:\Pass a new road funding plan, expected to be announced around the time of her State of the State address this month, to replace her proposed 45-cent gas tax hike, which was widely panned.\Begin to make changes to Michigan's K-12 education system to reverse years of underperformance on basic subjects such as reading and math.\Implement the new auto insurance legislation in a way that brings true rate relief, as promised, especially to hard-hit Detroit residents, and ends rate discrimination based on where one lives. Since the law does not take effect until July 1 and because rate-setting is complex, Whitmer's Department of Insurance and Financial Services can play an important role in ensuring that reductions for medical coverage are not offset by hikes in other parts of the premium, such as liability coverage.\Parlay either public approval of her performance or unhappiness with Republican inaction on her key priorities into a flip of state House control from Republican to Democratic in the November 2020 election.\Help restore Michigan and its 16 electoral votes to the Democratic column in November after President Donald Trump won the state for Republicans in 2016 for the first time in a presidential election since 1988.\Faced with GOP majorities in the House and Senate, Whitmer tested the limits of her executive power, issuing a record 147 line-item vetoes during the extended fight over the budget and making unprecedented use of the State Administrative Board to shift funds within state departments away from the purposes the Legislature intended.\She announced an executive directive intended to make 200,000 more workers eligible for overtime pay, angering large sectors of the business community, went to court to try to stop a crude oil pipeline plan through the Straits of Mackinac approved under her predecessor, and in a move that has been temporarily frozen by judges, used emergency administrative rules to try to ban the sale of flavored vaping products as a public health measure.\Whitmer's actions brought accusations of overreach.

124,"LANSING – Her first year in office began with a record cold snap that exposed a weakness in Michigan's energy grid.\It ended with sickly green liquid oozing onto a major freeway near Detroit, raising fresh worries about long-standing environmental failures now bubbling to the surface.\In between, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed into law bills intended to reduce Michigan's highest-in-the-nation auto insurance premiums, legalize Internet gambling and sports betting, and reform the criminal justice system by raising from 17 to 18 the age at which accused offenders are routinely treated as adults.\But Whitmer fell far short of fulfilling her signature campaign pledge to ""fix the damn roads,"" ultimately approving a 2020 budget that allocated $375 million less to repair roads and bridges than the version recommended by the Republican-controlled Legislature.\Analysts' appraisals of Whitmer's 2019 performance vary widely. Some say Whitmer fared better than could be expected in advancing her priorities in the face of GOP opposition. Others view her handling of the state budget negotiations, in which she sought to pressure lawmakers by vetoing close to $1 billion in spending — not all of which has been restored — as disastrous. The most common view is somewhere in between.\But the events that bookended Whitmer's first year demonstrate how the governor in many ways spent the year responding to crises — including crumbling roads — that predate her administration. What she does in 2020 to shape events and circumstances while confronting new challenges may prove a more instructive test.\Those tests include whether she can:\Pass a new road funding plan, expected to be announced around the time of her State of the State address this month, to replace her proposed 45-cent gas tax hike, which was widely panned.\Begin to make changes to Michigan's K-12 education system to reverse years of underperformance on basic subjects such as reading and math.\Implement the new auto insurance legislation in a way that brings true rate relief, as promised, especially to hard-hit Detroit residents, and ends rate discrimination based on where one lives. Since the law does not take effect until July 1 and because rate-setting is complex, Whitmer's Department of Insurance and Financial Services can play an important role in ensuring that reductions for medical coverage are not offset by hikes in other parts of the premium, such as liability coverage.\Parlay either public approval of her performance or unhappiness with Republican inaction on her key priorities into a flip of state House control from Republican to Democratic in the November 2020 election.\Help restore Michigan and its 16 electoral votes to the Democratic column in November after President Donald Trump won the state for Republicans in 2016 for the first time in a presidential election since 1988.\Faced with GOP majorities in the House and Senate, Whitmer tested the limits of her executive power, issuing a record 147 line-item vetoes during the extended fight over the budget and making unprecedented use of the State Administrative Board to shift funds within state departments away from the purposes the Legislature intended.\She announced an executive directive intended to make 200,000 more workers eligible for overtime pay, angering large sectors of the business community, went to court to try to stop a crude oil pipeline plan through the Straits of Mackinac approved under her predecessor, and in a move that has been temporarily frozen by judges, used emergency administrative rules to try to ban the sale of flavored vaping products as a public health measure.\Whitmer's actions brought accusations of overreach. Whitmer pointed to her election mandate and said that while she prefers to work collaboratively with lawmakers, she won't hesitate to use the full extent of her executive powers when she deems it necessary.\""In your first year, you set a tone for what you're going to accept, and how you're going to operate, and we did that,"" Whitmer told the Free Press.\Amid some signs of a softening economy, Whitmer touted announcements by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Ford Motor Co. that together are expected to bring 10,000 or more jobs to Detroit and southeast Michigan.\But just as Whitmer could not be blamed for energy supply problems that prompted her to ask Michiganders to lower their thermostats during a record January cold snap, following a fire at a Consumers Energy compressor station, Whitmer can take little credit for automotive industry announcements that have been years in the planning.\In fact, the leaking detected in December of highly contaminated water from an I-696 embankment in Madison Heights, traced to a nearby former metal-plating factory, could mark Whitmer's transition from the ""not on my watch"" variety of issues to those that mostly are.\Pollution at Electro-Plating Services dates back several years.

""January and February are when they get torn to pieces.""\""I don't see anything really outstanding or breathtaking going on,"" said Marks, who works at a manufacturing facility in Elkhart.\Marks said he would love to have lower auto insurance premiums, but it remains to be seen whether he will get them as a result of legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed into law by Whitmer.\""Saying ain't doing, as the saying goes,"" said Marks, who describes himself as disillusioned with both major parties. So far, ""they haven't gone down a bit.""\Cheri Kuslick, 65, a retired steelworker who lives in Plainfield Township in Iosco County, said she feels Whitmer is more interested in public relations and taking credit than getting things done.\""I don't think she understands the plight of the people of Michigan,"" Kuslick said. ""Most of the people I know are pretty much poor.""\Kuslick said she is hopeful the auto insurance legislation Whitmer signed in 2019 will reduce her premiums in 2020, but would like to see Whitmer focusing on issues related to improving health care. That includes pushing for a single-payer health care system, which is a federal issue, as advocated by Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination supported by Kuslick.\She said she does not support Whitmer's position in favor of more immigration.\""We don't have the jobs for our own children,"" she said.\Michael McIntosh, 69, a retired elementary schoolteacher, said he feels Michigan's state government is broken under term limits, with lawmakers more interested in laying the groundwork for future lobbying jobs than working for the people.\GOP lawmakers in Michigan's Legislature are ""doing to her what the Republicans (in Congress) did to Obama,"" McIntosh said. ""They're not going to help,"" and that fact makes it difficult to form a judgment about Whitmer's performance, he said.\""They're just going to make it very difficult for her to do anything"" that she would get credit for, he said\As for the auto insurance legislation, McIntosh, of Chelsea, expects premiums will not come down much and many accident victims will not receive the health care treatment they need.\Though he blames Republican lawmakers for their unwillingness to work with Whitmer, McIntosh said Whitmer also made a mistake by proposing such a high gas tax increase. Whitmer should have foreseen that the GOP would be unwilling to negotiate with her or offer a reasonable counterproposal, he said.\""She boxed herself into a corner,"" he said.\Jonathan Chapman, 32, a business owner who lives in Huron Township, said he's not impressed by Whitmer's performance in her first year.\""I think she wants to raise taxes quite a bit,"" said Chapman, who believes he voted for the Republican candidate, former Attorney General Bill Schuette, in 2018.\Instead of significantly raising gas taxes, Chapman wants the state to spend existing road dollars more effectively and efficiently and wants to know what happened with the money generated from a 2015 road funding agreement that hiked registration fees 20% and increased the fuel tax by 7 cents per gallon.\Chapman did not approve of the line-item vetoes Whitmer used during the budget impasse with legislative Republicans.\""She basically threw a temper tantrum and didn't get anything for it,"" he said. ""I'd honestly like to see her recalled.""\A former smoker who used e-cigarettes to help kick the habit, Chapman did not approve of the ban Whitmer imposed on flavored vaping products. ""I think what she did to the vaping industry was horrible,"" he said.\He does not believe the auto insurance legislation will significantly reduce premiums and believes a better solution would be to scrap Michigan's no-fault system.\Michael Martin, 33, a Farmington Hills musician, said he has not formed an opinion about Whitmer.\Martin feels there has been no progress on roads, but he approves of the recent legalization of Internet gaming.\He would like to see less regulation of the recreational marijuana industry to allow for more retail outlets.\Contact Paul Egan: 517-372-8660 or pegan@freepress.com.

Higher gas mileage standards will save fuel
\
The recently announced fuel efficiency standards are indeed ambitious, which is exactly what this nation needs to improve vehicle fuel efficiency, reduce our dependence on oil, protect the environment and save American drivers money at the pump (""New fuel economy rules unfair to auto industry,"" April 23).
\
The proposed standards will save drivers 55 billion gallons of fuel - that's more than $100 billion in fuel costs - over the lifetime of the vehicles covered by the rule. This is not chump change.
\
Technology has been central to the ability of automakers to meet and exceed previous standards, and we expect that this proposal, once finalized, will spur further technological innovations to increase fuel economy. I want to emphasize that these standards are proposals, and we look forward the public's comments and input.
\
Raising the gas tax, as suggested by this paper, simply means sending more money to Washington, where it will be sliced, diced and spread thinly over hundreds of programs -- doing nothing to reduce congestion or ease traffic. We need to aggressively explore alternatives to petroleum-based taxes, not increase our dependence on them.
\
I believe in American ingenuity, and I know our automakers will make great strides over the next several years to protect our environment and reduce emissions - without sacrificing safety. Our approach ensures that consumers can enjoy the freedom to purchase the cars they want while requiring all manufacturers to do more.
\
Indeed, the president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers -- representing General Motors Corp., Toyota Motor Corp., Ford Motor Co. and others -- called our proposal ""an aggressive, single, nationwide standard"" and noted that ""automakers are prepared to meet (the) challenge"" our proposed rule presents.

Lansing -- Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Andy Dillon would revitalize Michigan's blighted urban areas as part of a five-pronged plan to fix the state's economy, Dillon told The Detroit News Editorial Board on Friday.
\
Dillon, who met with the board on the same day he rolled out his ""Renewing the Michigan Dream"" plan in Southfield, said Michigan needs a governor who can overcome partisan bickering to carry out structural reforms to the tax structure, education, state government and Michigan's regulatory environment.
\
His plan would focus on growing jobs and the economy; reforming the budget process and streamlining government reform; bolstering education; expanding clean energy while protecting the environment; and revitalizing urban areas, preventing foreclosures and encouraging young people to stay in Michigan.
\
Dillon said he would build on the state's strengths, which he said include research and development prowess, a skilled work force, advanced manufacturing expertise and industrial infrastructure.
\
Michigan also has a plethora of universities and strong tourism and agricultural industries that should be further developed, he said.
\
""The economic development in this state is completely fragmented; there's no coordination,"" Dillon said. ""We need to get the private sector together with economic development and sit down and say here are the assets to build on, what's the 10-year mission, where are we going to take this state, and what's the strategy to get there?""
\
Among his positions, Dillon:
\
*Would restructure the Michigan Business Tax and eliminate the MBT surcharge.
\
*Supports temporarily increasing the gas tax until Michigan finds a permanent solution to its road funding problems.
\
*Would increase investment in the 21st Century Jobs Fund and No Worker Left Behind programs.
\
*Wants to streamline the state's purchasing system to save money.
\
*Would increase investment in preschool and work toward a K-14 education system.
\
*Would strengthen protection of the Great Lakes.
\
*Is pro-life; would not seek to overturn stem cell research.

\
Grand Rapids -- Michigan's next governor should be someone who makes tough, bold decisions, works better with legislators and helps find ways to spur immediate job growth for a moribund economy, five gubernatorial candidates agreed at a forum Friday.
\
The men -- four Republicans -- and one woman who is the only declared Democrat often found common ground on reforming taxes, expanding business and keeping residents from fleeing the economically troubled state. And although she was not mentioned by name much, they all talked about being a better leader for a state with challenges than they implied Gov. Jennifer Granholm has been.
\
""The issue in this election comes down to really job creation,"" Ann Arbor businessman Rick Snyder said. ""How do we make our government create an environment where jobs can flourish and let small business go out and innovate?""
\
Joining Snyder on the stage at the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel at a forum sponsored by the Michigan Press Association were U.S. Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Holland; Oakland County Sheriff Mike Bouchard; State Sen. Tom George, R-Kalamazoo; and Democratic state Rep. Alma Wheeler Smith, D-Salem Township.
\
Attorney General Mike Cox, a Republican candidate for governor; Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero, a Democrat; and House Speaker Andy Dillon, D-Redford Township, declined to attend. Bernero and Dillon haven't formally declared they're running but have launched exploratory committees.
\
The next governor, they said collectively, must make unpopular decisions to straighten the state out and regain the trust of the public. And that person needs legislative experience to know how Lansing works, they said.
\
""I think the next governor has to be willing to be a one-term governor and make the decisions that are necessary and not worry about being popular, but worry about being effective,"" said Bouchard.
\
Others agreed, but said the focus has to be taxes.
\
""The state needs bold, innovative tax reform if we expect to get this economy moving again,"" said Hoekstra.
\
The candidates were mostly not in favor of a ballot proposal to convene a constitutional convention, calling it a waste given all the problems the state faces, agreed unanimously the state has too many school districts and rejected raising the gas tax to help repair roads.
\
All but Smith called for a part-time Legislature.
\
George, a medical doctor, said his priorities would be reforming health care and Medicaid and getting spending under control.
\
Smith said her goal would be to ""generate capital from human growth.""

$4 gas fuels critics and supporters
\
Promote lifestyle changes
\
The May 11 ""Regular gas hits $4.09 in Romulus"" has some good points about carpooling and driving practices. When it comes to alternative fuel, we don't have any at this time. Corn ethanol results in a net energy loss, has less energy per gallon than gasoline and is already driving up the price of corn on our kitchen tables. The fact of the matter is that we need lifestyle change. The era of cheap gas is over, and we need more alternatives to cars. Our federal and state governments need to make a real commitment to high-speed rail.

Fuel mandates require aid
\
It is appropriate that government give tax relief when requiring businesses to take a given action. This help would not be an issue if the government would stop trying to be social manipulators rather than performing its main role of safeguarding the populace (""Feds should help with new fuel economy rules,"" May 12).
\
The marketplace will take care of fuel economy needs, and it will not require tax credits to do so. Repeal any mandates and render moot any need for tax credits. Keep it simple and avoid opportunity for fraud and abuse.

Don't copy Europe's taxes
\
I agree with the editorial that the new fuel economy rules are unfair to the auto industry, but I cannot believe The News is advocating a dollar tax on top of the $3.65 we're already paying for gas (which is supposed to go higher). Say goodbye to tourism and visiting mom and dad out of state and say hello to lots of people losing their jobs from the trickle-down effect.
\
Just because Europe has high taxes, does not make it a good idea. There are some great minds in this country. Surely they can come up with better solutions.

Stop skewering oil firms
\
The high price of oil remains a heavy load on all aspects of the American economy. It will never be admitted congressional politics has been the true and certain cause of this oil supply problem. Competitive markets do not lead to the highest prices, supply restrictions do. Congress allows phony political interests to block oil production in the United States. Governments, of course, are twisted in grief as trillions of dollars in gas sales also act as money machines.

Senators fuel high gas prices
\
The time has come to acknowledge the contributions Michigan's two U.S. senators, along with their Democratic colleagues, have made in raising our gas prices. They have prevented drilling for oil in the Alaska National Wildlife Reserve and offshore. Neither the wildlife or the environment have been harmed at Prudhoe Bay. Along with radical environmentalists, they have prevented the building of new refineries and nuclear power plants. So, if you appreciate the high gas prices, be sure to thank Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow.

Bring on high gas prices
\
In regards to high gas prices, I welcome them. We didn't learn our lesson 35 years ago with the Arab oil embargo in 1973? Back then we imported about a third of our oil; now we import about two thirds of it. So what next? More drilling and exploration in environmentally fragile areas? I'd rather not.
\
But if anything, we cannot go back to having gas go below $4 a gallon. Yes, it's painful. But if we ""get used to it"" or accept any politically pandering options, such as gas-tax holidays, we won't have the incentive to get our country off petroleum. We need concerted efforts to change our cars and trucks to hybrids, electrics or even other technologies.

High prices prompt solutions
\
Slant-drilling can pump oil from the Great Lakes, oceans and Alaska, but ""greens"" fear an accident. Blending corn-based ethanol with gasoline is a poor solution. Open land is being plowed into cornfields, raising the cost of both food and fuel. Ethanol reduces mileage and is expensive, subsidized by government.
\
Mandating more miles per gallon requires manufacturing small vehicles (unprofitable for American car companies). High prices are the best solution being offered. Expensive gasoline encourages resource development and reduces the popularity of unnecessary trips or vehicle size.

Higher taxes won't work
\
U.S. Sen. Carl Levin's answer to rising gasoline prices? More domestic production and domestic oil exploration? No, Levin desires to hammer the suppliers of this vital fuel with more taxes. Good feelings won't fill the gas tank while emptying one's pocketbook of disposable income.
\
Besides, $4 per gallon puts us on par with Europe, and the Democrats said that was a good thing.

130,"I am very happy that Michigan has expanded the availability of absentee ballots. As a person of a certain age, I have enjoy this service for several years. However, I have one recommendation for all the municipalities. The one thing we do not get is an ""I Voted"" sticker to wear proudly on Election Day. Could all city clerks consider adding one in with the absentee ballot, so that we too can show off our patriotism?\Karen Swiderski\Troy\I read (a recent Free Press article on nonprofit CEO compensation) with strong interest as I am the CEO of a nonprofit in southeast Michigan. Your article only tells part of the story, as you only focused on large nonprofits. The smallest budget in your analysis was $25 million. However, most nonprofits are much smaller. For example, the agency that I work with has a $3 million budget. There are many more nonprofits with budgets below $10 million in Michigan than those with larger budgets.\My agency is a nonprofit, faith-based social service agency that primarily serves low income individuals and families. My annual salary pales in comparison to the ones that you cited in your article. And, I am not alone. I know many nonprofit CEOs who look more like me than those who you highlight.\I do not begrudge the salaries cited in your article, but please tell the rest of the story. Will potential donors and taxpayers read your article and decide that their favorite nonprofits don't need their gifts because of the high CEO salary? The 990 for my agency is posted on my agency's website and my salary is included there. I hope that donors will not stop with your article, but will dive deeper into the budgets and salaries of other nonprofits.\Mark Robinson, Executive Director\Livingston County Catholic Charities\I am writing in regard to the article, ""U.S. proposes looser methane emission rule"" on page 10A Aug. 30. I know this article came from USA TODAY, but you still should take some responsibility for editing it.\First of all, your headline writer got it very wrong, this proposal does not ""loosen"" the methane emission rule, it does away with it entirely.\The article also failed to mention that methane is a 25 times more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, making the EPA's acting Assistant Administrator Anne Idsal's comment that the rule offered ""minimal environmental benefit"" laughable, if it weren't so tragic.\And finally the article failed to mention that giants in the industry, including Exon-Mobil and Shell oppose the rollback — a very major oversight!\James Bull, Environmental policy coordinator\Detroit Audubon\The renaming of the former Cobo Center to TCF Center is certainly intriguing. Former Detroit Mayor Albert Cobo clearly promoted policies that negatively impacted African-American residents. At the same time, given that TCF Bank won the naming rights for the facility to the tune of $33 million, a sidebar comes to mind: I hope that TCF Bank's financial commitment to the local community includes foreclosure relief programs, as African-Americans in Detroit have been disproportionately affected by housing foreclosures for a number of years now.\Christopher Currie\Detroit\How does it feel to be in President Donald Trump's shoes? You can't get a 45-cent gas tax increase that you want to ""fix the damn roads"" from the state Legislature with an opposition majority. Like the current gas tax that is not specific to maintain roads but includes money for schools, and local projects that politicians love to get their hands on, you want the same thing.\Counties get road tax money to fix county roads but if you live in a subdivision or on a non-designated major road, the roads belong to you and I paid $5,000 additionally to have mine fixed.\You were elected to ""fix the damn roads."" That includes working with the opposition party to accomplish the task. ""Fix the damn roads"" means its now your job to find a way to do it by negotiating a budget with those other guys in the Legislature.\And that result may not be what you want but it is way better than shutting down the state government. You said you were the person to do it if elected governor. Are you up to the job?\Dimitri Popov\Grand Blanc\Michiganders already pay some of the highest gasoline taxes in the country, yet we have some of the worst roads. So what have these taxes been used for? Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's 45-cent tax increase for road repairs isn't the solution.\Before any new taxes are considered, let's find out where these taxes have gone. I have no problem paying a little extra to fix our crumbling infrastructure, but any increases put on the working tax payers of this state needs to be fair and equitable.\I am against paying one cent more until our government addresses the problems of the overweight trucks destroying our roads. For whatever reason, our politicians are keeping this issue off the table. Is it because of the trucking industry lobbyists?\If we are expected to pay more in taxes to fix our roads, then all contributing factors that are destroying them such as truck weight limits, overuse of road salt, lack of warranties for new projects, inferior materials being used, etc., need to be addressed.\Ken Sellers\Flat Rock\When is it going to end? Every year it is the same old story, those people in Lansing are crying that they have to raise taxes because they need more money. I say enough already.\We are taxed too much now. Before any budget is made every department that receives tax dollars needs to be audited by an independent auditor.

131,"Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vetoed 147 line items totaling more than $500 million in spending Monday, while signing all 16 budget bills sent to her last week by the Republican-controlled Legislature.\Whitmer's vetoes included $375million in proposed spending on roads. Fixing the roads was a major plank of Whitmer's campaign, but she said she's opposed to using general fund money, as the Legislature proposed, rather than revenues from increased fuel taxes.\Whitmer's actions — the most aggressive use of the veto power by a Michigan governor in recent memory — are the latest salvo in a fight over spending priorities between the first-term Democratic governor and GOP state lawmakers.\Whitmer's cuts are expected to prompt a new round of negotiations between her and Republican leaders on a supplemental appropriation, as Whitmer seeks to restore funds Republicans cut from her own priorities, including $185 million she said was cut from K-12 spending plans.\She announced the vetoes and other actions, including her budget signatures, just five hours before the start of the 2020 fiscal year. If she had not signed the budget bills by midnight, a partial government shutdown would have resulted. The total budget is $59billion, of which less than $11 billion comes from the general fund, the state's main checking account.\Whitmer said she cut pork from the budgets, as well as $375 million in one-time money Republicans appropriated from the general fund to fix Michigan's roads. Complete details on the vetoes were not immediately released.\""The Republican budgets were a complete mess, and today I used my executive powers to clean them up to protect Michiganders,"" Whitmer said in a news release. ""The state's budget is a reflection of our values, and make no mistake that public health and safety, access to health care, and protecting classroom spending is more important than handouts to lobbyists and vendors.""\There was an irony in Whitmer cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in spending on roads, as she campaigned in 2018 to ""fix the damn roads"" and built her budget around a proposed 45-cent gas tax hike to fix crumbling roads and bridges. But Whitmer said the one-time money Republicans want to spend hurts other priorities and is not a long-term fix. She said she's ready to go back work on a long-term road funding plan.\Budget action is expected to continue into Tuesday, when a special meeting of the State Administrative Board has been scheduled. That's a signal Whitmer intends to use — in addition to her line-item veto powers — her power to shift funds within individual departments from one program to another.\Governors can't move money from one department to another without approval of the Legislature. But the power to shift money within departments was upheld by the Michigan Supreme Court, in a 4-3 decision in 1993. That case arose after Republican Gov. John Engler shifted money within departments and was sued by legislative leaders.\House Speaker Lee Chatfield, R-Levering, called the budget impasse ""silly and completely avoidable.""\""Instead of working this out together, the governor decided to play political games and walk away from negotiations,"" Chatfield said in a news release. ""Her tactics wasted everybody's time and manufactured a crisis out of thin air.\Whitmer's budget, presented in March, was built around a bold but unpopular call for a 45-cent-per-gallon hike in the fuel tax that would generate an extra $2.5 billion annually, once fully implemented. Whitmer's plan would have spent that extra money fixing Michigan's crumbling roads and bridges, allowing her to take $468 million to $600 million in general fund money now targeted for roads and shift it to other state priorities, such as education and the environment.\The governor's proposed huge hike in the gas tax was widely seen as an opening gambit for negotiating a deal with GOP legislative leaders. But House Speaker Lee Chatfield, R-Levering, and Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, rejected the plan. They said they spent much of the summer working on a Republican counter-plan for roads, but they never publicly unveiled one. Whitmer said the proposals they did put forward involved generating extra cash by borrowing against, or delaying payments on, state teacher pension obligations, which she would not endorse.\The 45-cent gas tax hike, which Democrats never introduced in the form of a bill, was officially declared dead in late August, when House Minority Leader Christine Greig, D-Farmington Hills, described the plan as ""extreme"" and unlikely to happen.\Whitmer repeatedly said she would not sign a 2020 budget that did not include a comprehensive road funding plan, but she abandoned that position Sept. 9 in the face of a looming state government shutdown. At that time, she and Republican leaders agreed to focus on finalizing the budget first and return to road funding talks later.\GOP leaders said Whitmer walked away from budget negotiations Sept.11. She denied that and accused them of wasting most of the summer, when the Legislature was on an extended break.\Greig went on to negotiate with House Republicans, without the governor's involvement, a plan for funding K-12 schools. That agreement, which was announced Sept. 18 and boosted special education funding by $30 million, intensified speculation about fractured relations between Whitmer and Greig, whom some accused of undercutting the governor.\The House and Senate ultimately sent a budget to Whitmer's desk last week without her prior sign-off.\On roads, the GOP approved $400million in one-time spending from the general fund on top of the $468 million in general fund spending on roads called for in the a 2015 road funding agreement. The budget also called for record spending on K-12 schools with a 2.4% boost, but that was less than the 3.5% increase proposed by Whitmer.\CREDIT: Paul Egan"
132,"FREE PRESS LANSING BUREAU CHIEF\Michigan's new governor will take the wheel of a state that's speeding toward a $1.6-billion deficit with little room to maneuver.\He'll share the Capitol with perhaps the most inexperienced Legislature in modern times thanks to term limits, as well as a new secretary of state and attorney general.\He must hit the ground running with a team that will shape the way Lansing does business for the next four years.\Compared with eight years ago, when Jennifer Granholm swept into office on wings of hope and history as the first female governor, Michigan is shell-shocked by economic decline driven by the near-collapse of the U.S. automotive and financial sectors.\Republican Rick Snyder says he'll cut business taxes. Democrat Virg Bernero says he'll revive manufacturing. Either will tackle a government and tax system that can no longer coexist as they are.\""Without a doubt, the challenges facing the new governor are going to dwarf the problems any new governor confronted in the past,"" said Dennis Cawthorne, lobbyist, ex-legislator and Michigan devotee. ""In the past, there have been nooks, crannies and cookie jars available to somehow fill the billion-dollar deficits.\""It truly appears this time we have run out of them.""\Tough tasks await new leader\A lot of big decisions await the next governor, starting the day after Tuesday's election.\He even should start planning his State of the State address in January, said Bill Rustem, president of Public Sector Consultants of Lansing.\""It's the articulation of a vision -- where does he want to take the state?"" said Rustem, who was an adviser to former Gov. William Milliken.\""It's a brand-new Legislature. It's important setting the tone for the first 100 days, and for the administration beyond that.""\But before the big speech, the next governor will have his hands full putting that administration together.\And scouting the Legislature, with whom he'll dicker and deal.\And making plans to tackle the worst financial picture in many decades.\The economy drowns out other issues that usually have more exposure in gubernatorial campaigns, such as the environment and funding for public schools, said Doug Roberts, a former state treasurer and now director of the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at Michigan State University.\Michigan has lost 10% of its jobs since 2007 -- among the worst losses in the nation, according to the Economic Policy Institute. (Nevada lost more than 14% of its jobs, and Arizona lost 10.3%.)\The state budget avoided massive cuts since 2008 thanks to $3.9 billion in federal stimulus money -- money that won't be there next year.\State budget director Bob Emerson said this downturn is deeper and different than past recessions.\Emerson served in the Legislature for 26 years. In 1983, he cast a decisive vote in the House to increase the income tax by 38% to help new Gov. James Blanchard erase a projected $900-million deficit caused by a severe recession.\But the auto industry and the economy recovered, and the income tax eventually was lowered (after two recall elections cost Democrats control of the Senate).\That kind of turnaround isn't in the cards in the term of the next governor, Emerson said.\""Now, the changes are permanent,"" he said. ""We will grow from where we're at, not recover to where we used to be.""\Among the issues the new governor and Legislature must address:\Whether to cut or freeze pay and benefits for state employees and public school teachers.\The soaring cost of Medicaid, which rose 110% in 10 years.\Prison costs increasing beyond the state's means.\How to fix deteriorating roads, including a possible gas tax increase.\Whether to restore the Michigan Promise college scholarships, increase the Pure Michigan tourism campaign advertising budget and maintain the nation's most generous tax credits for movie makers.\Here's a rundown of what the new governor will face.\The budget\The projected deficit is at least $1.6 billion for 2011-12, and it could be even bigger. That's largely because $977 million in federal stimulus funds and emergency aid to schools that balanced this year's budget won't be available.\A common conservative refrain is that the budget has grown uncontrollably. Much of that is hype, although some costs, such as Medicaid and employee pay and benefits, have risen dramatically.\There are about 55,300 full-time state employees -- 13% fewer than in 2000. But the cost of wages and benefits has risen nearly 38%, according to the Senate Fiscal Agency.\Rising health insurance costs for state and school employees are straining the budget, as well.\Medicaid rolls have grown by 11,000 per month during the past year and consumed $10.7 billion in Michigan, mostly federal money. Nearly one of every five Michigan residents is eligible for Medicaid health coverage of some kind.\But total state spending from Michigan taxes -- income, sales and business taxes -- rose only 3.1% in the past decade, according to the Senate Fiscal Agency. Meanwhile, the rate of inflation was 33%.\That means tax revenue badly trailed the cost of state government. The budget has been constantly plugged with temporary fixes and federal aid to avoid mass layoffs and major cutbacks.\The state general fund dropped 16% (to about $8.3 billion). The general fund consists of state tax revenues and pays for much of state government's operations.\Total state spending on public schools rose by 18% from 2000-10. But that includes $1.5 billion in federal stimulus funding during 2008-10.\The Legislature\The governor and Legislature will be under pressure from a restive public to put aside partisanship and solve problems.\Both gubernatorial candidate profess their willingness to work with the Legislature. That will be tested, depending on which party controls the House, Senate or both.\Regardless of which party has control, the new Legislature will be newer than ever.\There'll be at least 81 new faces among the 110 House and 38 Senate members, thanks to term limits.\At least 93 will have two years or less of experience, Emerson said. There could be more if incumbents are defeated Tuesday.\And by late next week, both chambers are expected to choose new leaders.\""It's a massive education experience for a new governor at a very difficult time,"" Emerson said. ""On top of having to figure out what he wants to do with state government, what his vision is, how to formulate a new budget by March 1, a budget that has massive problems.""\Besides dealing with the budget and taxes, the Legislature will begin drawing new boundaries for political districts for the Legislature and Congress.\The project, called reapportionment, is based on population changes from the 2010 census. Depending on which party controls the Legislature, governor's office and the state Supreme Court, the outcome will likely give either Republicans or Democrats a boost in holding House and Senate majorities for the next decade.\Lynn Jondahl, a former longtime Democratic House member, said it's important that the next governor appoint an effective liaison to work with the Legislature.\He said Gov. Jennifer Granholm continually butted heads with conservative Senate Republicans. That could even happen with a governor and members of his own party in the Legislature.\""If you have a governor who's a problem solver, not an ideologue, you can have something close to stalemate if the Legislature is more ideological,"" Jondahl said.\The team\Jondahl led Granholm's transition team after she was elected in November 2002. Transition teams assemble the new administration and work with the outgoing governor to assure a smooth hand-off of power.\With election victory come the spoils. But among 55,000 state employees, the next governor can directly appoint only 136 to lead departments or to his own staff.\""Your own supporters don't appreciate this,"" Jondahl said. ""You can appoint less than 200 people. They want to see a takeover.""\Doug Roberts, state treasurer under Republican Gov. John Engler, said the most important appointments are a budget director and treasurer -- the two in charge of state money -- and they should be named as soon as possible, along with their deputies.\Roberts advised that the budget director be a Michigander familiar with state finances to shorten the learning curve for the coming fiscal crisis.\And the new governor should avoid surprises.\Roberts said he discovered in the first months of Engler's administration that the state treasury had $150 million less than expected. He had to give his new boss this sheepish explanation:\Someone had discovered a drawer full of business tax refund checks that were never mailed or accounted for -- $150 million in all.\""The lesson,"" Roberts chuckled, ""is check all the drawers when you get there."""
133,"At first blush, using sales tax would appear to be an evenhanded way of raising revenue for our decrepit roads, but in essence, that would mean that tens of thousands who don't drive would be paying more for the use of the roads by others.\I guess the conservative mind-set has always been that an increase in sales tax is equitable, because that way, everybody is paying their share. But, in reality, a penny spent by someone who has only three pennies is impacted far more than the person who has 1,000 of them.\Not being an economist, my humble suggestion would be to raise the fees for car and truck licenses. These are the people and the businesses who use and destroy our roads and bridges.\Jerry Soble\Orchard Lake\Increase the gas tax, not the sales tax, for roads\I would like for those who support raising the sales tax for fixing roads to explain why they think the little old lady who doesn't even own a car should pay more for what she buys just so the guy with the huge Escalade doesn't have to pay more for gas.\The gas tax does a near perfect job of taxing the people that use the roads most. Why change that?\Wayne M. Brehob\Dearborn\Deficit is down, but we have a long way to go\The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released revised figures stating the fiscal 2014 federal deficit is $486 billion. That represents a reduction from the 2013 deficit of $681 billion.\Americans need to remember how bad it was in 2008, with hundreds of billions of dollars used to bail out Wall Street and insurance giants; federal loans to GM and Chrysler; stock markets in a virtual free fall, and unemployment rates in low double digits. It is scary to think where our country would be if those controversial actions hadn't been taken.\Now is not the time for the president and Congress to bask in a job only started. There are decades of sensible budget management ahead to pay off our $18-trillion national debt. Hopefully, this wonderful trend will be allowed to continue without Congress and the president trying to figure out how to ""improve"" it.\William D. Krull\Roseville\Netanyahu has a lot of nerve criticizing Obama\To his credit, President Barack Obama continues to stand on principal, ignore the powerful pro-Israeli special interests, and not capitulate to the likes of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. For Netanyahu to go on American television and criticize our president is the height of arrogance and disrespect. He needs to be reminded that the United States is one of a few nations left in the world who welcomes him, and that more than 120 nations have already thrown their support for Palestinian statehood.\Walter C. Shamie\Farmington Hills\Here's how to boost MSU football crowds\Graham Couch's article about the lack of student attendance at Michigan State football games misses an important point. While there may be some apathy regarding the football program, I don't think it is a lack of support or school spirit.\As an MSU student in the 1960s, we looked forward to every football Saturday. Almost every game started at noon, and tailgates for students began in the dorms and Greek houses sometimes as early as Friday night. The games lasted maybe 21/2 hours and postgame parties followed.\Now, with ESPN manipulating the schedule to fit its TV slots, games that start at 8p.m. and last until midnight are a burden to most students, as well as most alumni. Eastern time zone teams should play early, leaving late-night slots to Western teams. While football is still an interest, it is not the only interest -- a fact today as it was when I was in attendance.\Make it fun for the students and those in attendance, not a burden because of ESPN money.\James L. Terlecki\Grand Rapids\It's time America does away with plastic bags\There is no doubt that plastic bags are destroying our environment and aquatic life.\In Europe, they do not give out paper or plastic bags at the stores. When shopping, you have your own cloth or mesh bag that is reusable, and if you forget to bring it, you buy another or go home to get it.\Once again, we show the ""ugly American"" to the world by polluting the environment.\Paul A. Heller\Washington Township"
134,"LANSING – Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vetoed 147 line items totaling $947 million in spending Monday, while signing all 16 budget bills sent to her last week by the Republican-controlled Legislature.\Whitmer's vetoes included $375 million in proposed spending on roads. Fixing the roads was a major plank of Whitmer's campaign, but she said she's opposed to using general fund money, as the Legislature proposed, rather than revenues from proposed increased fuel taxes.\""The governor campaigned on a promise to fix Michigan roads — yet she just rejected $375 million to boost repairs without tax increases or cuts to essential services,"" said Rep. Shane Hernandez, R-Port Huron, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.\Though her news release only itemized about $500 million in cuts from line-item vetoes, Whitmer spokesman Tiffany Brown said the vetoes total $947 million in cuts.\Whitmer's actions — believed to be the most aggressive use of the line-item veto power by a governor in Michigan history — are the latest salvo in a fight over spending priorities between the first-term Democratic governor and GOP state lawmakers.\Whitmer's cuts are expected to prompt a new round of negotiations between her and Republican leaders on a supplemental appropriation, as Whitmer seeks to restore funds Republicans cut from her own priorities, including $185 million she said was cut from her K-12 spending plans.\She announced the vetoes and other actions, including her budget signatures, just five hours before the start of the 2020 fiscal year. If she had not signed the budget bills by midnight, a partial government shutdown would have resulted. The total budget is $59 billion, of which less than $11 billion comes from the general fund, the state's main checking account.\Whitmer said she cut pork from the budgets, as well as $375 million of the $400 million in one-time money Republicans appropriated from the general fund to fix Michigan's roads. Complete details on the vetoes, plus veto letters prepared for the Legislature, were not immediately released.\""The Republican budgets were a complete mess, and today I used my executive powers to clean them up to protect Michiganders,"" Whitmer said in a news release. ""The state's budget is a reflection of our values, and make no mistake that public health and safety, access to health care, and protecting classroom spending is more important than handouts to lobbyists and vendors.""\Whitmer built her budget around a proposed 45-cent gas tax hike to fix crumbling roads and bridges. Whitmer said the one-time money Republicans want to spend hurts other priorities and is not a long-term fix. She said she's ready to go back to work on a long-term road funding plan.\""It's a record,"" Bill Ballenger, a former Republican state senator and publisher of The Ballenger Report, a Capitol newsletter, said in reference to the number and size of the line-item vetoes. ""Nobody else is even close.""\More important to know is the details on the cuts and how Republican lawmakers respond, Ballenger said.\Budget action is expected to continue into Tuesday morning, when a special meeting of the State Administrative Board has been scheduled. That's a signal Whitmer intends to use — in addition to her line-item veto powers — her power to shift funds within individual departments from one program to another.\Governors can't move money from one department to another without approval of the Legislature. But the power to shift money within departments was upheld by the Michigan Supreme Court in a 4-3 decision in 1993. That case arose after Republican Gov. John Engler shifted money within departments and was sued by legislative leaders.\House Speaker Lee Chatfield, R-Levering, called the budget impasse ""silly and completely avoidable.""\""Instead of working this out together, the governor decided to play political games and walk away from negotiations,"" Chatfield said in a news release. ""Her tactics wasted everybody's time and manufactured a crisis out of thin air.\Whitmer's budget, presented in March, was built around the bold but unpopular call for a 45-cent-per-gallon hike in the fuel tax that would generate an extra $2.5 billion annually, once fully implemented. Whitmer's plan would have spent that extra money fixing Michigan's crumbling roads and bridges, allowing her to take $468 million to $600 million in general fund money now targeted for roads and shift it to other state priorities, such as education and the environment.\The governor's proposed huge hike in the gas tax was widely seen as an opening gambit for negotiating a deal with GOP legislative leaders. But Chatfield and Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, rejected the plan. They said they spent much of the summer working on a Republican counter-plan for roads, but they never publicly unveiled one. Whitmer said the proposals they did put forward involved generating extra cash by borrowing against, or delaying payments on, state teacher pension obligations, which she would not endorse.\The 45-cent gas tax hike, which Democrats never introduced in the form of a bill, was officially declared dead in late August, when House Minority Leader Christine Greig, D-Farmington Hills, described the plan as ""extreme"" and unlikely to happen.\Whitmer repeatedly said she would not sign a 2020 budget that did not include a comprehensive road funding plan, but she abandoned that position Sept. 9 in the face of a looming state government shutdown. At that time, she and Republican leaders agreed to focus on finalizing the budget first and return to road funding talks later.\GOP leaders said Whitmer walked away from budget negotiations Sept. 11. She denied that and accused them of wasting most of the summer, when the Legislature was on an extended break.\Greig went on to negotiate with House Republicans, without the governor's involvement, a plan for funding K-12 schools. That agreement, which was announced Sept. 18 and boosted special education funding by $30 million, intensified speculation about fractured relations between Whitmer and Greig, whom some accused of undercutting the governor.\The House and Senate ultimately sent a budget to Whitmer's desk last week without her prior sign-off.\On roads, the GOP approved $400 million in one-time spending from the general fund on top of the $468 million in general fund spending on roads called for in a 2015 road funding agreement. The budget also called for record spending on K-12 schools with a 2.4% boost, but that was less than the 3.5% increase proposed by Whitmer.\Whitmer said the extra general fund money lawmakers put into roads came at the expense of other state priorities. Both state universities and community colleges received increases of less than 1%, and Whitmer and her officials said the budget also left funding for state prisons and information technology programs, among others, woefully short.\Contact Paul Egan: 517-372-8660 or pegan@freepress.com.

PORTLAND - Residents in Ionia and Barry counties will take the first step toward selecting their next state representative during the Aug. 3 primary election.
\
Brian Calley, current State Representative for the 87th District, is stepping down to contend for the 33rd District State Senate position. Three Republican candidates and one Democratic candidate have stepped forward to contend for the representative seat that Calley is vacating.
\
Voters will go to the polls on Aug. 3 to select one Republican candidate from a list that includes Michael Bremer of Middleville, Mike Callton of Nashville and Steve Fabiano of Portland. The winner advances to the November general election to face Democrat Greg Grieves of Saranac.
\
The Portland Review & Observer sent a questionnaire to each of the three Republican candidates for the 87th House seat. The responses are below.
\
Michael Bremer
\
Background information/experience
\
Bremer: ""I have lived in the Middleville area since 1952. I was raised on a farm and learned early what a good work ethic is. I have a B.A. in elementary education and a B.S. in health, physical education, and recreation. My broad range of ""life experiences"" include teaching elementary school, adult education classes, and working as a substitute teacher for over 20 years.
\
""I spent 17 years at Bradford White Corporation with the last five of those years as the personnel manager. I have worked for Barry County Mental Health, Hearthstone Assisted Living, and spent five years as the program director for the Thornapple Area Parks and Recreation Commission. I am currently a Barry County Commissioner.""
\
Why are you running for the position of State Representative?
\
Bremer: ""I am running for this position because I believe one person can make a difference! I am very tired of the political rhetoric surrounding nearly every issue. It would seem that 'politicians' are more concerned about what's best for their careers or their party than they are for what may be best for the people of Michigan. I am a good listener and mediator. As a House of Representatives we can work together for the betterment of this great state.""
\
What are your thoughts on the current state of funding education in Michigan, both public education and higher education?
\
Bremer: ""The better educated and informed we are the better for all of us! There is no place in our society that ignorance is an asset. I believe that we must make every effort to maintain and/or increase funding to education.""
\
How do you think the state should solve its structural deficit problem within its budget?
\
Bremer: ""Admittedly I don't have an answer to the budget mess. We simply have to stop spending more than we take in. Education (which includes such areas as MSU Extension, local D.A.R.E. programs, adult drug courts and their related rehabilitation programs), economic development (jobs), roads and infrastructure, agriculture and tourism, and the condition/protection of our environment are in my 'No cut zone'...everything else is open for discussion.""
\
Roads and infrastructure at the state and county level have deteriorated as revenues that fund those repairs have decreased. How do you feel this problem should be solved?
\
Bremer: ""Roads and infrastructure are critical to the 'reinvention' of Michigan! We cannot expect to be successful if we don't have appropriate routes to get our products out to a hungry and needy world. I would support a 'small' increase to the current gas/diesel tax that was 100 percent dedicated to be distributed to the county road commissions for use at local discretion. That may not 'solve' the problem but it will certainly help.""
\
If elected, what issues or areas would you like to address?
\
Bremer: ""I would like to address the small business tax structure and make it much more economically feasible for the inventors and entrepreneurs that live among us (that are currently working from their barns, basements, and garages), to get to Main Street and start growing their businesses.
\
""I would also like to address the way we dispense monies from our educational fund. The 'gap' is too big - some schools get $4,000 per student per year while others get close to $8,000 per student per year.
\
""I would like to hammer on: reduce - reuse - recycle, energy efficiency and sustainable energy sources.
\
""And finally: No more unfunded mandates!""
\
Mike Callton
\
Background information/experience
\
Callton: ""I have served in the U.S. Army from 1982 to 1985, serving as a Petroleum Laboratory Analyst. I also have earned a bachelors degree and biology and a doctorate in chiropractic. I have been a practicing chiropractor for 20 years and own the Nashville Chiropractic Center in Nashville.
\
""I have also served as on the Nashville Village Council for five years, Maple Valley School board for eight years, including six as president, Eaton Intermediate School District Board for 10 years and have served on the Barry County Board of Commissioners for six years, including three years as chairman.""
\
Why are you running for the position of State Representative?
\
Callton: ""Michigan has serious fiscal issues that I can contribute to the solution. Jobs, the economy, unemployment, foreclosures, lack of road funds, lack of school funds are intertwined problems that can be addressed together.""
\
What are your thoughts on the current state of funding education in Michigan, both public education and higher education?
\
Callton: ""I never liked the way Proposal A linked school funding to the roller coaster sales tax. What is happening now was predictable. Schools need steady, consistent funding.""
\
How do you think the state should solve its structural deficit problem within its budget?
\
Callton: ""We can no longer afford the government we had. Raising taxes on families to keep the government from taking cuts is wrong. Government is supposed to work for us. We are not supposed to work for government.""
\
Roads and infrastructure at the state and county level have deteriorated as revenues that fund those repairs have decreased. How do you feel this problem should be solved?
\
Callton: ""Like my complaint with school funding, whoever hitched road funding to the roller coaster of gas sales had to know that lack of funding would be the eventual outcome when gas sales dropped.""
\
If elected, what issues or areas would you like to address?
\
Callton: ""Jobs and the economy. We have to make Michigan a better place to do business and create jobs.""
\
Steve Fabiano
\
Background information/experience
\
Fabiano: ""I have been married to my lovely wife, Cindy, for 32 years. We have three adult children and seven grandchildren. I have lived in Portland for over 30 years. I have been a successful small business owner since 1979, opening our first business, Fabiano's Restaurant & Lounge in Portland. We have successfully operated two restaurants, three grocery stores and one storage facility. This has given me experience on how to control expenses when revenues are down and still be successful.
\
""I have been a firefighter for 31 years starting as a volunteer for the Portland Fire Dept. and for the last six years I have been the Fire Chief of the Looking Glass Regional Fire Authority. I create and maintain budgets and I am proud to say that the last six years the fire dept. has been under budget.
\
""I am currently a councilman for the City of Portland.""
\
Why are you running for the position of State Representative?
\
Fabiano: ""I believe with my unique view of both the private and public sector, I can offer critical decision-making, leadership and common sense. From my door-to-door campaigning, I have found people do not want 'politics as usual.' I am not accepting contributions from any lobbyist groups. I am financing my campaign myself and with help from friends and family.
\
""When you vote for me, you will be voting for a voice of the people from Ionia and Barry counties. That is the job of a State Representative, to represent you!""
\
What are your thoughts on the current state of funding education in Michigan, both public education and higher education?
\
Fabiano: ""We need to have a 'No Child Left Behind' initiative. With the state drop-out rate hovering at 35 percent, we need to readjust our thinking and address the current requirements for graduation. I do think that math and science (and now Spanish) are extremely important for many to further their education and keep up in today's world but there are too many of our children (and many adults) who are just not math and science people. I feel that these are our children whose needs are not being met and are just getting too frustrated trying to make it. We need to make an investment in these 'left-behind' children.
\
""I think colleges should have a diversity of employers helping to create curriculum and programs to train students in their fields. Schools need to start early intervention with Pre-kindergarten. Graduation rates are 41 percent higher for those who participate in a pre-kindergarten program.""
\
How do you think the state should solve its structural deficit problem within its budget?
\
Fabiano: ""I have a simple plan and I am not even a nerd. First, we need to control expenses, too much money is being wasted and every program needs to be looked at. It needs to be understood that the government is not the answer to all the problems. A perfect example is why do we need MIOSHA when there is already a Federal OSHA?
\
""Second, we need to extend the sales tax to junk food. The Governor's plan to lower the sales tax to 5.5 percent and add it to services would just be another tax on businesses. By extending the sales tax, it would bring in enough revenue to balance the budget, repeal the Michigan Business Tax and help fully fund School Aid.""
\
Roads and infrastructure at the state and county level have deteriorated as revenues that fund those repairs have decreased. How do you feel this problem should be solved?
\
Fabiano: ""Roads and infrastructure have been deteriorating because monies have not been appropriately distributed. This goes back to the need to control expenses and make hard decisions on what gets funded and what does not.
\
""Under a Federal highway program, Michigan can receive 80% of the funding as long as the State commits 20%. It would be a shame to lose funds that we have already paid in Federal gas taxes.
\
""Eventually, we will need to increase Michigan's gas tax. It would have to be a limited increase and funds would need to go to both the state and local governments.""
\
If elected, what issues or areas would you like to address?
\
Fabiano: ""Elimination of the Michigan Business Tax.
\
""Support revenue sharing to local communities.
\
""Implement the new sales tax structure.
\
""Ensure fiscal responsibility and common sense spending.""
"
136,"LANSING – Her first year in office began with a record cold snap that exposed a weakness in Michigan's energy grid.\It ended with sickly green liquid oozing onto a major freeway near Detroit, raising fresh worries about long-standing environmental failures now bubbling to the surface.\In between, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed into law bills intended to reduce Michigan's highest-in-the-nation auto insurance premiums, legalize Internet gambling and sports betting, and reform the criminal justice system by raising from 17 to 18 the age at which accused offenders are routinely treated as adults.\But Whitmer fell far short of fulfilling her signature campaign pledge to ""fix the damn roads,"" ultimately approving a 2020 budget that allocated $375 million less to repair roads and bridges than the version recommended by the Republican-controlled Legislature.\Analysts' appraisals of Whitmer's 2019 performance vary widely. Some say Whitmer fared better than could be expected in advancing her priorities in the face of GOP opposition. Others view her handling of the state budget negotiations, in which she sought to pressure lawmakers by vetoing close to $1 billion in spending — not all of which has been restored — as disastrous. The most common view is somewhere in between.\But the events that bookended Whitmer's first year demonstrate how the governor in many ways spent the year responding to crises — including crumbling roads — that predate her administration. What she does in 2020 to shape events and circumstances while confronting new challenges may prove a more instructive test.\Those tests include whether she can:\Pass a new road funding plan, expected to be announced around the time of her State of the State address this month, to replace her proposed 45-cent gas tax hike, which was widely panned.\Begin to make changes to Michigan's K-12 education system to reverse years of underperformance on basic subjects such as reading and math.\Implement the new auto insurance legislation in a way that brings true rate relief, as promised, especially to hard-hit Detroit residents, and ends rate discrimination based on where one lives. Since the law does not take effect until July 1 and because rate-setting is complex, Whitmer's Department of Insurance and Financial Services can play an important role in ensuring that reductions for medical coverage are not offset by hikes in other parts of the premium, such as liability coverage.\Parlay either public approval of her performance or unhappiness with Republican inaction on her key priorities into a flip of state House control from Republican to Democratic in the November 2020 election.\Help restore Michigan and its 16 electoral votes to the Democratic column in November after President Donald Trump won the state for Republicans in 2016 for the first time in a presidential election since 1988.\Faced with GOP majorities in the House and Senate, Whitmer tested the limits of her executive power, issuing a record 147 line-item vetoes during the extended fight over the budget and making unprecedented use of the State Administrative Board to shift funds within state departments away from the purposes the Legislature intended.\She announced an executive directive intended to make 200,000 more workers eligible for overtime pay, angering large sectors of the business community, went to court to try to stop a crude oil pipeline plan through the Straits of Mackinac approved under her predecessor, and in a move that has been temporarily frozen by judges, used emergency administrative rules to try to ban the sale of flavored vaping products as a public health measure.\Whitmer's actions brought accusations of overreach. Whitmer pointed to her election mandate and said that while she prefers to work collaboratively with lawmakers, she won't hesitate to use the full extent of her executive powers when she deems it necessary.\""In your first year, you set a tone for what you're going to accept, and how you're going to operate, and we did that,"" Whitmer told the Free Press.\Amid some signs of a softening economy, Whitmer touted announcements by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Ford Motor Co. that together are expected to bring 10,000 or more jobs to Detroit and southeast Michigan.\But just as Whitmer could not be blamed for energy supply problems that prompted her to ask Michiganders to lower their thermostats during a record January cold snap, following a fire at a Consumers Energy compressor station, Whitmer can take little credit for automotive industry announcements that have been years in the planning.\In fact, the leaking detected in December of highly contaminated water from an I-696 embankment in Madison Heights, traced to a nearby former metal-plating factory, could mark Whitmer's transition from the ""not on my watch"" variety of issues to those that mostly are.\Pollution at Electro-Plating Services dates back several years. But Whitmer's Department of Environment, Great Lakes & Energy has also acknowledged that it said in March — incorrectly — that there was little likelihood that contaminated chemicals would migrate beyond the site of the plant on 10 Mile Road.\Asked recently to grade herself on her first year in office, Whitmer said this:\""I'm humble enough not to give myself an A+, even though I think our effort has been an A+.""\Here is how others see it.\Julie Metty Bennett, CEO of Public Sector Consultants, a nonpartisan public policy consulting firm in Lansing, said Whitmer's first year was mostly about establishing a relationship with the Republican-controlled Legislature.\""It takes two to tango and get things done,"" Bennett said.\Though that relationship was at many times ""rocky,"" Bennett said that Whitmer and Republican leaders ""spent the year testing each other's limits"" in ways that will prove important for 2020.\Whitmer showed ""she isn't afraid to wield the powers of the executive office,"" and ""is not going to get rolled,"" Bennett said.\In the process, she ""notched a few wins,"" including the deal to reform no-fault auto insurance, she said. Getting an early deal on that exceeded the expectations of many observers, she said.\Whitmer's proposed 45-cent gas tax hike was ""definitely a bold move"" that would have given Michigan the highest fuel taxes in the country, Bennett said.\But ""starting out bold can be a wise move,"" she said. In terms of testing boundaries and getting to know Republican leaders, ""she played her biggest card with her first hand, and I don't criticize her for that.""\With the groundwork that was laid in 2019, Bennett said she is optimistic for 2020 on two key Whitmer priorities — infrastructure and education.\Heather Lombardini, president of the Republican political consulting firm, Sterling Corp., said she gives Whitmer an F grade.\""She talks a good talk when it comes to working with both sides, but her lack of leadership and skills showed through"" during an extended impasse with Republican leaders over the 2020 budget, Lombardini said.\""She is definitely still in the learning phase of transitioning from Senate minority leader to our leader,"" she said. ""I am hoping 2020 shows improvement.""\Karen Dumas, a Democratic communications strategist in Detroit, said she respects and supports Whitmer and wants to see her succeed.\""Any time you have someone who is new, your expectations are probably increased,"" but Whitmer took office facing many challenges, including a Republican-controlled Senate, and ""it would be almost unfair to give her a grade,"" said Dumas, who was communications chief for former Detroit Mayor Dave Bing.\""I would have liked to see her be a little bit more aggressive,"" and push back harder against Republican lawmakers on several issues, including roads, she said.\""Republicans don't like potholes any more than Democrats do.""\Proposing a 45-cent gas tax hike ""was shortsighted,"" and ""wasn't really well thought out,"" partly because it would be felt the most by those least able to afford it, Dumas said.\""Maybe her team isn't adequately preparing her,"" and could have helped to produce a proposal that was more realistic and better researched, she said.\Dumas doesn't believe Michigan's problem of excessively high auto insurance premiums has been solved, either.\""Detroiters are disproportionately carrying a burden that other parts of the state don't bear,"" she said.\Under the new legislation, people may get relatively small savings on their premiums, but they will lose far more in the event of a catastrophic injury from a car accident, she said.\Dumas noted that Ann Arbor-area businessman Shri Thanedar — not Whitmer — got the most Democratic gubernatorial votes in Detroit. She said it remains to be seen whether Whitmer can motivate Detroiters to show up at the polls in large numbers.\Choosing Garlin Gilchrist, who was a 2017 candidate for Detroit city clerk, as her running mate and lieutenant governor was ""a pretty smart move"" which has helped Whitmer in Detroit, Dumas said.\But so far, ""as a resident, we don't see the results. We're still talking about roads,"" Dumas said.\""I want to see the toughness that I know exists.""\Whitmer signed 178 public acts in 2019. That's the fewest since 1960, when 163 bills were signed into law, Michigan Information & Research Service, Inc. reports.\But most would agree that the volume of new laws is not a good measure of a governor's performance, especially when the governor and the Legislature come from two different political parties.\Whitmer's approval and job performance ratings in her first year, as measured by Lansing pollster EPIC-MRA, generally exceeded the first year numbers of Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, who unveiled an unpopular tax on pension income in his first budget.\But Whitmer's numbers have never topped 50%. In the most recent poll, conducted in August, 46% of respondents said they had a favorable impression of Whitmer, while 27% said they had an unfavorable impression, and the rest did not know or would not say. On Whitmer's job performance, 43% gave her a positive rating and 45% gave her a negative rating.\Since Michigan governors generally receive strong support from members of their own party, how Independent voters view them can be crucial.\Contact Paul Egan: 517-372-8660 or pegan@free press.com.

He doesn't believe that politics are a popularity contest, but rather an intellectual tool -- and sometimes a weapon to reorder the social landscape in keeping with his vision.

Gov. John Engler's latest focus is education. He wants it improved, and for those not able to meet state standards, he has announced that he is willing to provide state assistance. Not everyone applauds his efforts and probably even fewer want the help that Engler will likely supply.
\
We do not believe that the governor wants to become the superintendent of Detroit Public Schools or, for that matter, any other school system in Michigan. He should not have to.
\
No one doubts that our youth are at risk. The public school systems of many of our rural and urban communities throughout the state are woefully inadequate in providing a proper education to our children.
\
Parents, children and the business community cry out for action on this issue. It should not come as a surprise, then, that the governor joins them. We all should. His State of the State speech confirmed that over half of this year's state budget would be dedicated to improving the education of our youth.
\
In past Mackinac Island editions the governor has always held to his belief that the state should not micro-manage local government -- a ""less is best"" philosophy. But he sees his role in public education in Michigan much differently. As governor and as a father, John Engler believes that it is his obligation to speak out wherever children are being put at risk. It is his stated goal to strive for changes in our public educational system so that Michigan youth can survive in the global employment market. It is his premise that if we fail our youth, we ensure the eventual failure of the state. That, he says, is something he will not allow to happen.
\
We applaud the governor, as we do all who put education first in our communities. The future of Detroit and, indeed, the nation begins and ends with education. It is time to put aside partisan feelings that focus on future political careers and, instead, give top priority the education of our youth. They have the smallest voices in politics, yet have the greatest impact on the future direction of our state.
\
The cooperation of state and local government is essential for Michigan's survival.
\
Gov. Engler's vision -- less government, more emphasis on self-reliance and entrepreneurship -- has its critics, both Black and White. But it is a vision and, to some degree, a map that will at least for now navigate through a greater reality of a rapidly changing world.
\
CHRONICLE: Regarding the regional transportation issue in metro Detroit, do you see yourself intervening to bring some closure to this problem? Could you provide some incentive for the perspective players to resolve this issue?
\
ENGLER: I think that they already have all the incentive in the world to solve the regional transportation issue. There is a real need for the expansion of the service between Oakland County, Detroit and Wayne County. You can work together and fill the needs of residents for jobs or you can continue to work separately and reduce the service and continue to cripple your local economy. It is really not something that the state has a seat at the table with regard to. I'm putting my focus on improving the roads and infrastructure on which the buses run. Proponents say this is an impossible issue to resolve, especially in an election year. But I say that increasing service would be a popular thing to do in any year.
\
CHRONICLE: Many business leaders and proponents to the roads issue say we should have proposed a gas tax long ago to address the issue. Were you hoping to avoid this gas tax?
\
ENGLER: That was my hope. I hate raising taxes. I want to cut taxes. That is evident in the 21 tax cuts we have already had in Michigan. In many ways the fuel tax is a tax that hits those who would be least able to pay. We have tried to be careful in the steps we are taking. We have had the road commission in Lansing asking for a 10 to 12 cent gas tax for roads. I think it is unrealistic and wrong. We are asking for 4 percent, but that is only after every other avenue has been exhausted to raise the funds. That is why we went to Washington to fight for more dollars.
\
We are continuing to make progress on roads. In urban areas like Detroit, we are expecting completion of the Davison Freeway, an $80 million renovation, this year. This road before three years ago was a local road and under the control of Wayne County, with no hope of salvation when the state came in and took it over and will soon be done. That's progress. We continue to repair bridges in the metro Detroit area that are crumbling and plan to complete 200 bridges before we are done. We are also working on I-75 and I-94 and the connectors at the Ambassador Bridge to make it more accessible for traffic using our international gateway.
\
We do think that there are some things that we can do to create a more rational system of management for Michigan's highways and roads. That will result in some significant savings that can be put back into picking up the pace of repair. We think that there are some policy changes that we can make that will also save money. The Michigan Department of Transportation will be 25 percent smaller next year than it was in 1991, yet we are better able to build and repair roads than we were then.
\
That is the commitment that we made to make efficiencies from a state level, and I believe that it is an example for our local road commissions to follow. We have had a decentralized system of road repair and construction and I feel that it has been a very ineffective one that needs to be changed. There needs to be more clarification on what the issues are and who is responsible. We need to hold our local road commissions accountable for the condition of the roads they are responsible for.
\
There has been much said in the press about the condition of many roads and, more often than not, they are not state funded roads. And, frankly, the public doesn't care, they just want them fixed. But the reality is that if it is not a road funded by the state, we can't fix it. The public should be aware of who is accountable for the roads in their area, and if it is a state, city, or county-run road, take it up with the party that is responsible.
\
CHRONICLE: You have taken a strong stance on public education in the state, but particularly in our urban areas. What is your ultimate goal for public education and do you see yourself as a superintendent of Detroit Public Schools?
\
ENGLER: First, I don't think that the state should micro-manage local government but when it comes to education, I believe the state plays a different role. Public education in Michigan is really a state system that is carried out by locally created school districts. Those districts are a creation of the Legislature; they're districts that exist outside of their defining role.
\
Were the Legislature to decide tomorrow that there would be 83 school districts based on county boundaries, that would be a perfectly rational system to impose. So the relationship is different between the state and local school districts. Having said all of this, I am still a supporter of local control for school districts.
\
I think that there is a lot of misinformation about what my intentions are. My objectives are simple: Every child deserves the opportunity to have a world class education regardless of where that child is growing up, regardless of their family situation and regardless of their neighborhood surrounding the school. I believe that when a child walks through that school door, they should have a safe, secure environment conducive to learning from competent, talented teachers. It will involve the families within the community to nurture this behavior and encourage its growth and success. That's what I want.
\
Now, when I don't see that existing I get concerned. When I see a level of violence in our schools that is so bad that the teachers fear for their lives, if that is the case, imagine how fearful the children are. If the level of programming is such that the money is being wasted at the administration, and consumed in the bureaucracy and not reaching the classroom, then I'm concerned.
\
Learning takes place in the classroom and that is where the resources should be. The maximum should be spent in the classrooms and the absolute minimum should be spent in administration. I am dedicated to reducing these unnecessary expenses in order to free up these dollars to put to work where they are most needed -- in the classrooms. And I believe that as governor I have an obligation to speak out where I see children being put at risk because their school isn't safe or is slipping behind academically.
\
I think that the rationale is very simple: If kids fail in school, they are much more likely to trail those who stayed in school and succeeded and are more likely to end up dependent upon the state and commit crimes.
\
CHRONICLE: In the past you have criticized Detroit for not having an urban development plan for the city. What is your viewpoint today? Is there a plan in place?
\
ENGLER: I think that the stadiums are a reality. I admit that I did not foresee the passing of the casino issue, but now you have the casinos. But, more importantly, you have Chrysler expanding their facilities in Detroit. Other businesses are announcing that they are locating in Detroit. We passed the Renaissance Zone legislation, which Detroit has wisely taken advantage of, and reduced the unemployment rate in the state. I think that is the kind of development that is lasting. I still have reservations about the idea that casinos industry is going to be the economic savior of Detroit. I believe that it is not going to generate any significant wealth and will ultimately end up hurting families in Detroit.
\
CHRONICLE: Image is everything. As the image of Detroit improves, so does the economic viability of the state. Do you see a new and improved image for Detroit?
\
ENGLER: Yes, I see the image of Detroit continuing to improve. There is no question about that. Is there still room to improve? Sure, but the direction is right and Detroit is making tremendous progress. That has to continue to be a priority for everyone. I am committed to seeing Detroit cleaned up. We need to get the publicly held property back in the hands of private development and have progress continuing to take place.
\
CHRONICLE: Are you pleased with the initial success of Renaissance Zones in the state, and what factor do you see them playing in future development?
\
ENGLER: I think we are going to continue to see increased interest in the zones. At the Michigan Jobs Commission we have been bombarded with calls from out of state for more information concerning the Renaissance Zones. I think that many businesses see this program as attractive; being tax-free zones, understanding that they are located in some rather rough areas of the state.
\
I think that many businesses see the long-term opportunity for success in rehabilitating these communities and making them economically sound again. That kind of economic revival will mean nothing but good things for the city of Detroit.

138,"
Since Democrats took control of Congress in January, Washington has targeted automobiles to reduce the alleged threats of energy dependence and global warming. Solutions have centered on increased government fuel economy mandates (40 percent in 10 years) and gas taxes (50 cents per gallon) to force Americans into smaller vehicles.
\
A test laboratory for the results of these proposals already exists in Europe, where the European Commission a decade ago mandated a 35 percent increase in miles-per-gallon standards and where gas taxes have driven fuel to nearly $7 a gallon.
\
If Europe is the future, have Democratic goals been achieved? The answer is decidedly no.
\
Europe's oil dependency
\
Europe's major economies are still more than 90 percent dependent on foreign oil and well short of their fuel economy goals as European buyers demand bigger vehicles.
\
On a trip this summer to France, I rented a four-door Renault Clio, Europe's No. 2 bestseller, for my family of four. I got the advertised 35 miles per gallon driving the compact sedan, which is a class smaller than America's best-selling midsize Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.
\
Yet, even the Clio's impressive fuel mileage does not meet the European Commission's 2008 fuel efficiency standard.
\
In 1998, the global warming-panicked commission set a goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions and raising fuel economy 25 percent to an equivalent of 39 miles per gallon by next year with the ultimate goal of raising fuel efficiency 35 percent to 45 mpg by 2012. The measure is similar to the U.S. Senate's goal of a 40 percent increase to 35 mpg by 2020.
\
Europe is nowhere close to meeting the goal. Makers of small cars like Renault are near the goal, while larger carmakers like Audi are off 25 percent.
\
Europe is missing its targets because even with $7-a-gallon gas (bolstered by a $3-a-gallon gas tax in France and similarly high taxes elsewhere), European Commission bureaucrats cannot control consumer tastes.
\
Consumers stage SUV revolt
\
The fastest growing segment in Europe these days is -- gasp! -- the SUV. Even as he lectures manufacturers to make smaller cars, European Commission President JosZ Manuel Barroso drives a Volkswagen Touareg SUV -- the highest carbon dioxide-emitting vehicle in Europe. Customer demand for light trucks is so strong that even holdouts like Renault and Peugeot this year started selling SUVs.
\
The 45 mpg target has led to heated debates in Europe that echo concerns here. Just like its U.S. counterpart, the European vehicle manufacturers trade association (ACEA) estimates the average vehicle retail price would increase nearly $4,500 to achieve the 2012 goal.
\
Says Fiat Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, the European Commission's aims are ""not doable at the Fiat level and not doable at the European level.""
\
Like their American peers, European greens think it's all an industry conspiracy to withhold better technologies. Jos Dings, director of the influential environmental lobby group, Transport & Environment, protested recent efforts to postpone the 45 mpg goal by arguing that the European Commission shouldn't be ""conned by the hysterical lobbying of ACEA.""
\
Other predictions also haven't materialized. Higher gas taxes have not jump-started an alternative biofuels revolution.
\
Europe's only viable alternative to gasoline remains another oil byproduct: diesel. The Clio's stingy fuel economy comes from a clean diesel power plant. With their 30 percent efficiency advantage over gas and a favorable federal policy that taxes diesel 40 percent less than gas, diesels make up more than 50 percent of French car sales.
\
Diesels beat hybrids
\
Though these turbocharged, direct-injection engines add a $2,000 premium to the price of a new car, buyers quickly make up the difference in fuel savings. Gas-electric hybrids like the Toyota Prius are also available in Europe, but they pale next to diesels with lower gas mileage and a higher $4,000 sales premium.
\
At enormous cost to consumers, European efforts to curb imported oil and reduce greenhouse gases are failing. France, for example, is still 95 percent dependent on foreign oil.
\
Meanwhile, the European transport sector's carbon dioxide emissions have increased 26 percent since 1990, while total greenhouse emissions are rising despite a commitment to Kyoto reductions of 8 percent below 1990 levels. In the United States -- despite congressional rules mandating a doubling of vehicle gas mileage since 1975 -- our oil imports have grown from 35 percent of consumption to 52 percent.
\
What is the goal of toughening auto regulations that have failed on both sides of the Atlantic? The answer is simply the perpetuation of bureaucratic power.
\
Renault Clio
\
Average miles per gallon: 35
\
European fuel economy goal: 39

139,"What are the greatest challenges faced by your constituents and what do you plan to do about it?\Jason Davis: The greatest challenge is of course jobs and the economy. If elected, I would properly invest in technology and innovation to create new jobs. I would support the introduction of improved mass transit options, connecting our largest cities and important city partners in the region. We also need to return support to our education system and provide important cross-training and educational options to our workers, making our state enticing for new businesses.\Gary Eisen: Besides the obvious concern for jobs, lower taxes, housings, good education etc. The greatest challenge to the voters is to elect a candidate they can trust. One who will not ""go with flow."" One who will step up and lead instead of follow. One who will put the people first. One that will make decisions, using common-sense. A candidate who is a warrior and not a wimp. I am that candidate.\Peter Frangedakis: Job creation, education, and creativity: I would like a 0% tax given to those American companies that have left Michigan to bring them back. Fully fund our education system because education and business go hand and hand. Work to repeal the senior pension tax (before they apply this to all senior pensions regardless of income) because this is a ""cash cow"" for the government and is not very creative because this is a slap in the face of seniors who have fought, built, and lived in this state.\Dan Lauwers: In talking with 81st District voters I think housing values are foremost on their minds, which of course, is in direct relation to the state of our economy and a lack of employment opportunities. Many people feel ""trapped"" in their homes and in their jobs. This is what I am hearing at events and in door to door visits with constituents. Addressing Michigan's attractiveness to business is my primary concern.\Dennis Peternel: The greatest challenges are unemployment, declining home values and budget cuts to governmental services. There isn't a quick solution to these problems; they were years in the making. However, I believe I can help create opportunities for growth by reducing regulations on small businesses and promoting our area by lobbying the lobbyists to examine our area as a place that is ripe for growth. This will help fill empty homes, spur entrepreneurship and raise property values, which in turn will increase household income and help our schools, police, fire and DPW's (departments of public work).\Patrick Phelan: The economy and education. Investments in infrastructure provide you with long-term assets that improve productivity and lower costs for businesses and individuals, while creating jobs in the short term. According to Moody's Economy.com, for every dollar of increased infrastructure spending, the economy averages $1.59 growth. Investments in education would put more teachers in classrooms to reduce class sizes, which improves student outcomes to provide a talented workforce for sustainable economic growth.\Thomas Raymond: Jobs are #1, we need to promote our accessibility of distribution of products and services. We are a border county with bridge, ferry and rail access and with I-69 and I-94 trucking. We need to promote the EDA (Economic Development Alliance and support their effort to bring manufacturing and technical jobs to St Clair County.\Stewart Sternberg: Increasing jobs and attracting people to the area. One thing that legislators need to remember is that one out of four jobs in Michigan are related to agriculture. We should be encouraging the export of Michigan's bounty, and we should also be sure that we're using Michigan produce when possible, such as in our school lunches. We also need to make sure that our natural resources are maintained. Outdoor recreation is important to this area, not just for the enjoyment of local residents, but because it makes the Blue Water Area a destination for tourism. People want to come here to hunt and fish. We need to make sure the Department of Natural Resources has the funds necessary to do its job. One other challenge I'll address here, and there are many others, is the quality of education. This isn't a just a local problem, but rather a problem which needs to be addressed statewide. We need to review our curriculum and stop micromanaging local control of school districts. We should recognize that the curriculum being put in place now isn't appropriate for all students. We should consider ways of offering different tracks, remembering not all students are bound for higher learning. Instead, we should make available more tech and vocational programs for students who have different aptitudes. We should also stop trying to teach to a test and instead focus on individuation--something we can't do if we're cutting teachers and raising the number of students in a classroom.\Michigan's roads need fixing. How will we get the money to do it?\Davis: We need to start charging trucks at the same pound rate as we do passenger cars. It is important that all drivers are accepting the same responsibility to maintain our roadways. Also, by equalizing the tax rate on diesel fuel as gasoline, we will increase our revenue while maintaining equality amongst drivers.\Eisen: Michigan gets 19 cents tax per gallon for road repair. Now that the vehicles are getting higher mileage there is less revenue for roads. We can't depend on the federal government, because they are broke. Maybe it's time to get creative with ""A good driver privilege program"" and a ""Road lottery"" these are two of my programs that could bring in hundreds of millions for roads without raising taxes.\Frangedakis: Several ways: Considering driving is a privilege I would like to see diesel tax matched to regular gas taxes because the majority of the damage to our roads are caused by semi's. Toll roads that collect fees only from out of state/country semi's. Michigan non-commercial driving residence could use their valid Michigan drivers licenses to bypass fee collection.\Lauwers: Michigan's infrastructure improvements need to be addressed like any investment for future growth. Funding needs to be part of an overall strategy to make Michigan the best state in the Midwest to locate a business. This means a comprehensive evaluation and reorganization of how we tax and support our businesses and residents. I believe ""through government"" is the least desirable way to do most things, but the best or only way to do some things - roads are one of those some things.\Peternel: I am for making the tax rate for diesel and gas the same. We also must examine what impact hybrid vehicles and alternative energy vehicles are having on our road tax revenues. The money we use for fixing roads comes from the gas and diesel taxes at the pump. If less fuel is sold, less tax is captured. I would like to see a study on how lowering tax rates on fuel might increase sales thus capturing more tax revenue. There has to be a sweet spot.\Phelan: My experience as a civil engineer has shown me that we are going to have to raise revenue by adjusting the gas tax to at least make up for inflation and tax diesel at the same rate. The gas tax was last raised in 1997 to 19 cents per gallon. Adjusted for inflation, that would be about 27 cents today, so we are 8 cents below 1997 levels. The tax should also be changed to a percentage of wholesale in order to make automatic adjustments for inflation and take politics out of the equation.\Raymond: With serving on the county road and bridge committee for the last five years I have seen the decline in funds going to all roads. State, county and local road funds have not been divided fairly for years. Our gas prices have been all over the board with no state gas tax increase in over twenty years. The state has benefited with the 6% sales tax on higher priced fuel however the 19 cents per gallon for roads is still the same. A few cents per gallon dedicated to roads would make a big difference to road repairs and the windfall in sales tax on fuel could have a greater share going to roads. I also feel we need to fix what we have before building new.\Sternberg: We've started addressing this problem by asking that all the money collected from the gasoline tax go toward fixing the roads. We need to make sure we have the revenue so we can collect matching federal funds. We need to act on this and be aware that the longer we wait to fix roads and bridges, the more expensive it becomes.I support the bipartisan package of bills which propose converting the per/gallon gasoline and diesel excise taxes to a single tax based on the wholesale price of gasoline and asking voters to approve a new vehicle registration fee to fund county transportation issues.\How would you assure local officials who face the loss of personal property tax revenue?\Davis: The personal property tax really placed a burden on small businesses at a time where businesses are going through an extreme hardship. Local officials understand the importance of having these businesses within their limits. Yes, the loss of this revenue may hurt now, the loss of the businesses would have a much larger toll. By easing this burden on businesses, you are giving them room to invest in more services, employees and promotion, which would be better for the business and community.\Eisen: Lets start with the personal property tax, it keeps businesses from coming to Michigan. This is a bad tax for job creation. We are one of a few states that tax the equipment (machinery, desks, computers, etc ) of businesses every year. A small portion of this tax goes to schools and the majority of the rest I am told goes to pay pensions. Maybe we ""all' have to look at the bigger picture instead of what is just in front of us?\Frangedakis: As a councilman our municipality needs this revenue to ensure the services provided to our citizens. I would assure ""all"" municipalities any personal property tax revenue cut will be supplemented with a newly well researched and feasible source of revenue. Any cut without a solution to supplement these funds will greatly diminish the needed services to our citizens. I would push for a supplemental source of revenue without raising taxes before any cuts are imposed.\Lauwers: My assurance to the local officials regarding funding would be my philosophy of less is more when it comes to government - and consistent with this line of thought: local is preferable to county and county preferable to state and state before federal. Accountability and accessibility suffers at each level of government. I will support efforts to keep decisions and accountability as close to the citizens it affects as possible. We cannot ""de-fund"" the local government at the expense of state or county government, and I will not support efforts that seek to do so.\Peternel: I alone cannot guarantee tax revenue however I do believe it needs to be replaced and I look forward to working with others to come up with a solution that is beneficial to all.\Phelan: While I support the elimination of the personal property tax, which is a disincentive for business investments, I will only support elimination of the tax if it is completely replaced by a guaranteed revenue source. Additionally, any replacement revenue must come from business taxes and not be added to the tax burden of individuals. The loss of these revenues would have a detrimental effect on the services delivered by communities, particularly cities like Marysville that get over 20% of their tax revenue from personal property taxes.\Raymond: It is awfully hard to make any assurances as the Personal Property Tax effects each municipality differently. In our township (Cottrellville Township) we stand to lose around $4,000 annually, however, there are communities in our county who could lose hundreds of thousands of dollars. Because of this wide range effect there is no same for all that can deal with this issue. I feel a flat tax on profits would be the fairest way to address this issue, the tax rate then will be the challenge.\Sternberg: We needed to change the PPT, but it was handled poorly. Instead of making the local officials face the brunt of the loss of revenue, it should have been the state shouldering the burden in the form of allowing businesses a tax credit.\What actions should be taken to increase job creation in the area?\Davis: As I mentioned in my earlier answer, we need to really invest in technology and innovation. While the auto industry is making a rebound, the recession taught us that we cannot risk all of our worth/revenue in one arena. We must also invest in mass transit, connecting our larger cities together and with those across our region, bringing in businesses and consumers. Lastly, we need to make sure our educational system is sound, making our citizens the most skilled, prepared and competitive workforce, thus making our state a hotspot for new and expanded businesses.\Eisen: Getting rid of the personal property tax is a good start. Then we should go to States that have low unemployment to find out why and what they are doing, that we are not. Why would a business pick Kentucky or Tennessee instead of Michigan? To solve a problem , you must find out, what caused it.\Frangedakis: Fully fund our education system. Education and business go hand and hand. No industry will move to a location if the education system is underfunded or ill managed. Our education system is being pulled in too many directions; schools are closing and this hurting our children and grandchildren and possibly the chances for new industry.\Lauwers: Much of what needs to be done to increase jobs in our area is bigger than just our area - it is the state as a whole. In addition to making our state a desirable destination for business - we need to support efforts to highlight our unique blue water and maritime resources. We need to be emphasizing what people love about our area - which is the fact that this a great place to raise a family.\Peternel: We need to capitalize on tourism and educational institutions available in our area. These two areas create a good environment for job growth. In addition, we need fewer regulations for starting and growing a business. Government doesn't create jobs, entrepreneurs do. We need to encourage them and make training available in emerging technologies.\Phelan: We should increase investment in infrastructure, which provides jobs as well as long-term returns on investment. We should also invest in education to create a talented workforce that employers look for when searching for a new location. Targeted investments should be made in growth industries that provide good paying jobs and support a strong middle class. We need to continue to invest in placemaking and tourism to bring visitors to our naturally beautiful area.\Raymond: Getting the Personal Property Tax issue settled quickly, across the board tax incentives to start up and relocation of companies to Michigan and those currently here wishing to expand. I feel these incentives need to have some strong guidelines and accountability that they will provide the jobs promised or they lose the incentive. We have given long term tax breaks to many companies who at the end of their relief have moved on to other areas to avoid taxes.\Sternberg: I support the Hire Michigan First plan. Reward companies hiring 100 percent Michigan labor; make sure businesses doing state work only utilize Michigan labor; require companies accepting economic development incentives to file reports about who they hire and to make sure they are hiring Michigan labor; penalize companies hiring undocumented workers. I also support making money available for retraining displaced workers. We need to continue offering responsible economic development incentives and to work with existing businesses to filter out unnecessary and redundant regulations and to identify workable means to remove obstacles to job creation.\81st State Representative\Jason Davis (D)\Age: 27\Address: 8009 Marsh Road, Clay Township\Occupation: Assistant director of alumni engagement, University of Michigan-Dearborn\Political experience: None\Family: Father, Donnie; sisters.

Investments in education would put more teachers in classrooms to reduce class sizes, which improves student outcomes to provide a talented workforce for sustainable economic growth.\Thomas Raymond: Jobs are #1, we need to promote our accessibility of distribution of products and services. We are a border county with bridge, ferry and rail access and with I-69 and I-94 trucking. We need to promote the EDA (Economic Development Alliance and support their effort to bring manufacturing and technical jobs to St Clair County.\Stewart Sternberg: Increasing jobs and attracting people to the area. One thing that legislators need to remember is that one out of four jobs in Michigan are related to agriculture. We should be encouraging the export of Michigan's bounty, and we should also be sure that we're using Michigan produce when possible, such as in our school lunches. We also need to make sure that our natural resources are maintained. Outdoor recreation is important to this area, not just for the enjoyment of local residents, but because it makes the Blue Water Area a destination for tourism. People want to come here to hunt and fish. We need to make sure the Department of Natural Resources has the funds necessary to do its job. One other challenge I'll address here, and there are many others, is the quality of education. This isn't a just a local problem, but rather a problem which needs to be addressed statewide. We need to review our curriculum and stop micromanaging local control of school districts. We should recognize that the curriculum being put in place now isn't appropriate for all students. We should consider ways of offering different tracks, remembering not all students are bound for higher learning. Instead, we should make available more tech and vocational programs for students who have different aptitudes. We should also stop trying to teach to a test and instead focus on individuation--something we can't do if we're cutting teachers and raising the number of students in a classroom.\Michigan's roads need fixing. How will we get the money to do it?\Davis: We need to start charging trucks at the same pound rate as we do passenger cars. It is important that all drivers are accepting the same responsibility to maintain our roadways. Also, by equalizing the tax rate on diesel fuel as gasoline, we will increase our revenue while maintaining equality amongst drivers.\Eisen: Michigan gets 19 cents tax per gallon for road repair. Now that the vehicles are getting higher mileage there is less revenue for roads. We can't depend on the federal government, because they are broke. Maybe it's time to get creative with ""A good driver privilege program"" and a ""Road lottery"" these are two of my programs that could bring in hundreds of millions for roads without raising taxes.\Frangedakis: Several ways: Considering driving is a privilege I would like to see diesel tax matched to regular gas taxes because the majority of the damage to our roads are caused by semi's. Toll roads that collect fees only from out of state/country semi's. Michigan non-commercial driving residence could use their valid Michigan drivers licenses to bypass fee collection.\Lauwers: Michigan's infrastructure improvements need to be addressed like any investment for future growth. Funding needs to be part of an overall strategy to make Michigan the best state in the Midwest to locate a business. This means a comprehensive evaluation and reorganization of how we tax and support our businesses and residents. I believe ""through government"" is the least desirable way to do most things, but the best or only way to do some things - roads are one of those some things.\Peternel: I am for making the tax rate for diesel and gas the same. We also must examine what impact hybrid vehicles and alternative energy vehicles are having on our road tax revenues. The money we use for fixing roads comes from the gas and diesel taxes at the pump. If less fuel is sold, less tax is captured. I would like to see a study on how lowering tax rates on fuel might increase sales thus capturing more tax revenue. There has to be a sweet spot.\Phelan: My experience as a civil engineer has shown me that we are going to have to raise revenue by adjusting the gas tax to at least make up for inflation and tax diesel at the same rate. The gas tax was last raised in 1997 to 19 cents per gallon. Adjusted for inflation, that would be about 27 cents today, so we are 8 cents below 1997 levels. The tax should also be changed to a percentage of wholesale in order to make automatic adjustments for inflation and take politics out of the equation.\Raymond: With serving on the county road and bridge committee for the last five years I have seen the decline in funds going to all roads. State, county and local road funds have not been divided fairly for years. Our gas prices have been all over the board with no state gas tax increase in over twenty years. The state has benefited with the 6% sales tax on higher priced fuel however the 19 cents per gallon for roads is still the same. A few cents per gallon dedicated to roads would make a big difference to road repairs and the windfall in sales tax on fuel could have a greater share going to roads. I also feel we need to fix what we have before building new.\Sternberg: We've started addressing this problem by asking that all the money collected from the gasoline tax go toward fixing the roads. We need to make sure we have the revenue so we can collect matching federal funds. We need to act on this and be aware that the longer we wait to fix roads and bridges, the more expensive it becomes.I support the bipartisan package of bills which propose converting the per/gallon gasoline and diesel excise taxes to a single tax based on the wholesale price of gasoline and asking voters to approve a new vehicle registration fee to fund county transportation issues.\How would you assure local officials who face the loss of personal property tax revenue?\Davis: The personal property tax really placed a burden on small businesses at a time where businesses are going through an extreme hardship. Local officials understand the importance of having these businesses within their limits. Yes, the loss of this revenue may hurt now, the loss of the businesses would have a much larger toll. By easing this burden on businesses, you are giving them room to invest in more services, employees and promotion, which would be better for the business and community.\Eisen: Lets start with the personal property tax, it keeps businesses from coming to Michigan. This is a bad tax for job creation. We are one of a few states that tax the equipment (machinery, desks, computers, etc ) of businesses every year. A small portion of this tax goes to schools and the majority of the rest I am told goes to pay pensions. Maybe we ""all' have to look at the bigger picture instead of what is just in front of us?\Frangedakis: As a councilman our municipality needs this revenue to ensure the services provided to our citizens. I would assure ""all"" municipalities any personal property tax revenue cut will be supplemented with a newly well researched and feasible source of revenue. Any cut without a solution to supplement these funds will greatly diminish the needed services to our citizens. I would push for a supplemental source of revenue without raising taxes before any cuts are imposed.\Lauwers: My assurance to the local officials regarding funding would be my philosophy of less is more when it comes to government - and consistent with this line of thought: local is preferable to county and county preferable to state and state before federal. Accountability and accessibility suffers at each level of government. I will support efforts to keep decisions and accountability as close to the citizens it affects as possible. We cannot ""de-fund"" the local government at the expense of state or county government, and I will not support efforts that seek to do so.\Peternel: I alone cannot guarantee tax revenue however I do believe it needs to be replaced and I look forward to working with others to come up with a solution that is beneficial to all.\Phelan: While I support the elimination of the personal property tax, which is a disincentive for business investments, I will only support elimination of the tax if it is completely replaced by a guaranteed revenue source. Additionally, any replacement revenue must come from business taxes and not be added to the tax burden of individuals. The loss of these revenues would have a detrimental effect on the services delivered by communities, particularly cities like Marysville that get over 20% of their tax revenue from personal property taxes.\Raymond: It is awfully hard to make any assurances as the Personal Property Tax effects each municipality differently. In our township (Cottrellville Township) we stand to lose around $4,000 annually, however, there are communities in our county who could lose hundreds of thousands of dollars. Because of this wide range effect there is no same for all that can deal with this issue. I feel a flat tax on profits would be the fairest way to address this issue, the tax rate then will be the challenge.\Sternberg: We needed to change the PPT, but it was handled poorly. Instead of making the local officials face the brunt of the loss of revenue, it should have been the state shouldering the burden in the form of allowing businesses a tax credit.\What actions should be taken to increase job creation in the area?\Davis: As I mentioned in my earlier answer, we need to really invest in technology and innovation. While the auto industry is making a rebound, the recession taught us that we cannot risk all of our worth/revenue in one arena. We must also invest in mass transit, connecting our larger cities together and with those across our region, bringing in businesses and consumers. Lastly, we need to make sure our educational system is sound, making our citizens the most skilled, prepared and competitive workforce, thus making our state a hotspot for new and expanded businesses.\Eisen: Getting rid of the personal property tax is a good start. Then we should go to States that have low unemployment to find out why and what they are doing, that we are not. Why would a business pick Kentucky or Tennessee instead of Michigan? To solve a problem , you must find out, what caused it.\Frangedakis: Fully fund our education system. Education and business go hand and hand. No industry will move to a location if the education system is underfunded or ill managed. Our education system is being pulled in too many directions; schools are closing and this hurting our children and grandchildren and possibly the chances for new industry.\Lauwers: Much of what needs to be done to increase jobs in our area is bigger than just our area - it is the state as a whole. In addition to making our state a desirable destination for business - we need to support efforts to highlight our unique blue water and maritime resources. We need to be emphasizing what people love about our area - which is the fact that this a great place to raise a family.\Peternel: We need to capitalize on tourism and educational institutions available in our area. These two areas create a good environment for job growth. In addition, we need fewer regulations for starting and growing a business. Government doesn't create jobs, entrepreneurs do. We need to encourage them and make training available in emerging technologies.\Phelan: We should increase investment in infrastructure, which provides jobs as well as long-term returns on investment. We should also invest in education to create a talented workforce that employers look for when searching for a new location. Targeted investments should be made in growth industries that provide good paying jobs and support a strong middle class. We need to continue to invest in placemaking and tourism to bring visitors to our naturally beautiful area.\Raymond: Getting the Personal Property Tax issue settled quickly, across the board tax incentives to start up and relocation of companies to Michigan and those currently here wishing to expand. I feel these incentives need to have some strong guidelines and accountability that they will provide the jobs promised or they lose the incentive. We have given long term tax breaks to many companies who at the end of their relief have moved on to other areas to avoid taxes.\Sternberg: I support the Hire Michigan First plan. Reward companies hiring 100 percent Michigan labor; make sure businesses doing state work only utilize Michigan labor; require companies accepting economic development incentives to file reports about who they hire and to make sure they are hiring Michigan labor; penalize companies hiring undocumented workers. I also support making money available for retraining displaced workers. We need to continue offering responsible economic development incentives and to work with existing businesses to filter out unnecessary and redundant regulations and to identify workable means to remove obstacles to job creation.\81st State Representative\Jason Davis (D)\Age: 27\Address: 8009 Marsh Road, Clay Township\Occupation: Assistant director of alumni engagement, University of Michigan-Dearborn\Political experience: None\Family: Father, Donnie; sisters.

141,"Pan Godchaux has a novel strategy for unseating U.S. Rep. Joseph Knollenberg in the 9th Congressional District Republican primary: She's courting Democrats.\The moderate and mother of three from Birmingham figures she's more closely aligned politically with the electorate in the Oakland County district, which encompasses 22 communities, than the more conservative Knollenberg, a seven-term veteran from Bloomfield Township.\She's for abortion rights, opposes the war in Iraq, is a strong environmentalist and, as a former teacher, education is her staple issue.\Knollenberg opposes abortion, supports the war, takes pride in his many votes to cut taxes and scores high on the national pro-business agenda.\Aside from wooing other moderate Republicans, Godchaux, 60, is unabashedly going after Democrats whose candidate, Nancy Skinner, has no opposition in the primary. She's reminding Democrats that a Republican is likely to win the district, which leans 55 percent to her party, so if they want a moderate member of Congress, they'll cross over and vote for her.\""We're also targeting independents,"" said Godchaux, a former state lawmaker. ""People in this district are well educated, they understand how this works.""\Knollenberg, 72, a former insurance agent and father of two, has some advice for his opponent: ""Maybe she should just run as a Democrat. She's more liberal than most Democrats. I think she's wrong about the district. I do fit in well here and I have since 1992.""\John Klemanski, a political science professor at Oakland University, said Godchaux's attack plan is a sound one.\""She may be closer to a lot of the district on choice, education and the environment than Joe Knollenberg is,"" Klemanski said. ""There are two things going on in this district that could help her: There are a lot of moderate Republicans, and a lot of Democrats in the primary who don't have any interesting races to vote in. I don't know if she can win, but she has a reasonable strategy.""\Not all political observers agree. Bill Ballenger, editor of Inside Michigan Politics, figures Godchaux will ""get crushed.""\""If she won the nomination, she might be a better fit for the district than he is, but she's running from the left in a Republican primary against a guy who's not exactly a hopeless right-winger,"" Ballenger said. ""I don't see how that's a winning strategy.""\It's an uphill fight, no question. Knollenberg has $1.4 million on hand to defend his seat in the closing days of the primary election, while Godchaux has $214,000. He raised nearly $2 million overall, she came up with $425,000 -- but $300,000 of it was her own money.\Knollenberg took in more than $600,000 from political-action committees compared to $13,100 for Godchaux, according to the latest Federal Elections Commission campaign finance reports. She makes an issue of that difference. Several Knollenberg donors are transportation industry interests who might have something to gain by currying favor with the chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation.\""His loyalties are to party leadership and special interests, which he puts ahead of the people of the district,"" Godchaux says.\Knollenberg, whose Web site notes that his chairmanship on the subcommittee makes him one of Michigan's most powerful members of Congress, shrugs off such criticism.\""Anytime you do anything for anybody, it perhaps could look like there was a flow of money to a campaign committee,"" he said. ""But scrutiny and sunshine are applied to all of this. I don't make much of that at all. There's no cause and effect. I don't usually even know when the money comes in.""\Knollenberg says his proudest achievement is a bill he sponsored that clamps down on counterfeiters of auto parts and other products, a measure sought by the state's automakers and suppliers.\Godchaux points to the role she played while a state representative from 1997-2002 in forming a pro-education caucus among House Republicans. The group fought off legislation some saw as a threat to traditional public education, including a bill to lift the cap on the number of charter schools allowed in the state.\She says that is another clear difference between herself and Knollenberg: She's a staunch supporter of public schools; he backs vouchers.\But Knollenberg counters that he's also a strong public education backer. He says school vouchers may have a place in the array of options for parents, but says it should be a local decision.\Backers of Knollenberg say it doesn't make sense to toss out a veteran chairman of a key subcommittee, who is in a position to bring dollars for roads and bridges back to Michigan.\But Godchaux notes that Michigan gets back only 92 cents on every federal gas tax dollar it sends to Washington -- despite Knollenberg's position of power.\The Knollenberg file\Joseph Knollenberg\Home: Bloomfield Township\Born: Nov. 28, 1933 (72)\Family: Married, two grown children\Education: B.S., Eastern Illinois University\The Godchaux file\Patricia ""Pan"" Godchaux\Home: Birmingham\Born: Jan. 28, 1946 (60)\Family: Divorced, three children\Education: Bachelor's in American government, American University, Washington, D.C.; master's degree in education from Wayne State University\You can reach Mark Hornbeck at (313) 222-2470 or mhornbeck@detnews.com."

Postwar babies get attacked

As postwar babies growing up in Dearborn, we were told that if another country bombed the United States the prime target would be the Detroit area to take out our factories and manufacturing capability.

Just as the middle class was replaced by foreign, cheaper labor, so should the upper management. If the managers cannot change with the business environment, there are certainly managers in the world of the same experience who can. The Japanese successes are due entirely to a modern upper management structure and stakeholder mentality.
\
Hiring Japanese managers to fix the automotive companies is in the best interest of stockholders, if they can get the job done in this country. Incentives should be limited to stock, and contractual employment to eliminate job hopping.

Fuel rescue with gas tax
\
If higher gas prices are the only way to get Americans to use less oil, perhaps the rescue of the automakers should be financed by a gas tax rather than more deficit spending.

At first, I was all for the bailout loans for the Big Three domestic automakers because of the importance of that industry to our country's economy.
\
However, after finding out that the executives of these auto companies are giving themselves millions of dollars in ""retention"" bonuses, I'm not happy about the situation. The companies should get no taxpayer money until they get back the bonuses. After all, they say they are dangerously close to failing.

Economists are saying bankruptcy will enable creative solutions for the domestic automakers. They point to the recent airline industry's ability to refinance and get their labor costs in line with revenues. It is a completely different thing between a $300 flight and a $30,000 car. You need to believe there are service parts for your vehicle out five years. Bankruptcy leads hurts auto consumers' confidence. Sales will plummet further. A tiny GM is not good for America.

McCain: Boost funding for alternative-fuel vehicles
\
By David Shepardson
\
Detroit News Washington Bureau
\
WASHINGTON - Presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain today will call for more funding of advanced technology vehicles -- but also promises more accountability over government research spending.
\
""We will add to current federal efforts to develop promising technologies, such as plug-ins, hybrids, flex-fuel vehicles, and hydrogen-powered cars and trucks,"" McCain will say in a speech on the environment this afternoon in Portland, Ore., according to advance excerpts of his remarks released by the campaign. ""We will also establish clear standards in government-funded research, to make sure that funding is effective and focused on the right goals.""
\
The Arizona senator has reached out to automakers, attending the North American International Auto Show and meeting with executives in January. On Feb. 21, he toured a Ford plant in Wayne and then met with the CEOs of Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler LLC, along with General Motors Corp. President Fritz Henderson.
\
Automakers were rebuffed by President Bush when they urged him to boost research funding on batteries to $500 million over five years to speed the development of plug-in electric hybrid vehicles.
\
""Our economy depends upon clean and affordable alternatives to fossil fuels, and so, in many ways, does our security,"" McCain said. ""A large share of the world's oil reserves is controlled by foreign powers that do not have our interests at heart. And as our reliance on oil passes away, their power will vanish with it.""
\
McCain and his two Democratic rivals, Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, have all said they support a move by Calfornia and 12 other states to impose their own 30 percent reduction in vehicle tailpipe emissions by 2016. Automakers are strongly opposed to those standards.
\
Mary Nichols, who is chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, noted Monday that all three candidates' support for the California emissions standards ""are in writing.""
\
McCain and his Democratic rival, Sen. Hillary Clinton, were criticized for their support of a gas tax holiday by Dave McCurdy, president and CEO of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. He called their support for both a temporary reduction in gas tax and higher fuel efficiency standards ""hypocritical."" McCurdy, who spoke at a panel discussion at SAE's annual government and industry meeting in Washington, acknowledged his comment was a ""gratuitous dig.""

I urge House Speaker Andy Dillon, D-Redford Township, to stop delaying and allow a concurrence vote on the Senate-passed version of House Bill 4163, a comprehensive bill to make all Michigan workplaces smoke-free. This would protect all Michigan workers, including bar and restaurant employees, from the deadly toxins of second-hand smoke.
\
According to the surgeon general, there is no safe level of exposure to second-hand smoke. All workers deserve to work in a smoke-free environment. Why should waitresses be protected, but not blackjack dealers?
\
As a stepmother, I see the effects second-hand smoke have on my stepdaughter. Her mother smokes around her. My step-daughter constantly has respiratory problems.
\
Michigan should join the 33 other states that have enacted smoke-free legislation and pass HB 4163 now!

Adopt orphans
\
Concerning the May 17 LSJ article regarding parents in China grieving the loss of their only child after the earthquake, and then the parents complaining about their government's policy on there only being one child per family, I have a suggestion:
\
Why don't these parents show some real humanity and take on the care of a child who is now orphaned due to the earthquake?
\
These parents seem to be more concerned with having a mirror image of themselves to look at than having loving children. There is no need for them to have more children when so many kids will end up in orphanages.
\
Parents at least have each other for support as well as an adult understanding of death and earthquakes.
\
Can you imagine being a child and having your parents die while the world is falling down around you?

McCain's bad news
\
For all you drinkers who voted for George Bush because you wanted to have a beer with him, or will vote for John McCain: If he wins, you will get just what you deserve ... like 3 million manufacturing jobs gone, the highest gas prices and the most housing foreclosures ever.
\
McCain says women shouldn't get equal pay and that more women should work in coal mines.
\
He wants a holiday on gas tax for three months, which saves most people about $28, but would contribute to our $9 trillion deficit. The gas tax fixes roads and bridges.
\
McCain will eliminate the estate tax on the first $10 million and make the Bush tax cuts permanent, which only benefits the top 6 percent.
\
He says he'll cut Social Security payments and charge the elderly more for their medicine.

\
Lansing -- The Legislature failed to rescind a scheduled 3 percent Oct. 1 pay raise for state employees this week, but the House cut 3 percent from the salaries in state department budgets it passed Thursday.
\
The action means the raise is safe for now, but lawmakers or the state will have to come up with a way to fund it. The wage hike goes to some 35,000 unionized state employees.
\
Lawmakers have now passed a preliminary budget for nearly every state department in either the House or the Senate. Transportation stalled late Thursday night in the House because it was contingent on a gas tax hike. Each of the budget bills must be approved by both chambers before heading to the governor's desk.
\
The House also passed a preliminary version of a State Police budget bill Thursday that would keep the Detroit post open. The spending bill, approved by a 61-48 vote, calls for finding savings in other areas but doesn't specify how.
\
House Speaker Andy Dillon, D-Redford Township, issued a statement late Thursday saying House Democrats are determined to find revenue for the raise without further cuts to schools or vital services.
\
The House action followed the Senate's third failed attempt earlier Thursday to rescind the raise. ""As the state Senate has failed repeatedly to pass a resolution rescinding the 3-percent raise for state employees, the House today has passed budgets that incorporate those 3 percent savings,"" Dillon said.
\
""We will work with the governor, the Senate, and the state employee unions to ensure that those savings are realized.""
\
In another action, the award-winning Pure Michigan ad campaign will be back this summer, at least in part, because lawmakers agreed to spend another $9.5 million for the TV and radio spots featuring the voice of comedian Tim Allen.
\
But Gov. Jennifer Granholm slammed the Senate for ""shortchanging"" financing for Pure Michigan and failing to come up with a permanent funding source.
\
The House had passed a measure that would have borrowed $20 million from the Michigan Strategic Fund and paid back the loan with a $2.50 surcharge on rental cars at airports.
\
""Michigan's summertime economy will be shortchanged and jobs will be lost because the Senate majority leader has turned his back on Michigan's tourism industry,"" said Liz Boyd, spokeswoman for Granholm. ""His decision to hold new funding at $9.5 million will result in a campaign half the size of last year's, when every dollar generated a $2.23 return on investment.""
\
The House worked late into the evening to pass parts of the state budget before the Legislature's spring break starts Monday. Lawmakers hope to avoid a repeat of last year when they nearly missed the Oct. 1 deadline to pass a budget or risk a government shutdown.
\
The Legislature is months ahead of last year's budget process. They're trying to reconcile a projected $1.7 billion deficit. So far there's no consensus on spending cuts and most lawmakers aren't backing possible tax increases, either.
\
House Democrats Thursday passed budgets for departments of Agriculture; Energy, Labor and Economic Growth, State Police, Military and Veterans Affairs, General Government and Human Services.
\
The Senate passed budgets for higher education, community colleges, Corrections, Community Health, Natural Resources and Environment and School Aid earlier this week.
\
Progress stalled over the House-proposed budget for Transportation, which calls for a gas tax hike to raise $661.4 million in additional revenue.

Obama pursues Indiana workers
\
By Gordon Trowbridge Detroit News Washington Bureau
\
MUNSTER, Ind. -- From a family deep in Indiana farm country to a factory floor worn by five decades of use, Sen. Barack Obama has spent the past two days seeking to boost his appeal with the rural and working-class voters that have boosted Sen. Hillary Clinton's candidacy.
\
Forgoing the rock concert-style arena rallies that have been a hallmark of his campaign, Obama has concentrated on intimate settings and quiet conversations with voters in the days leading up to Tuesday's Indiana primary. The goal: recover some of the damage that may have been done by his controversial pastor and try to cut into Clinton's significant advantage with union members, lower-income voters and the small-town residents he once labeled ""bitter.""
\
""He was just like an average Joe, come home and sit on the front porch and talk"" said Adam Werner, a farmer who along with perhaps 20 other voters talked politics around a picnic table with Obama at a farm near rural Union Mills on Thursday. Werner, who entered the week undecided, said the intimate hour-long visit sealed his support for Obama.
\
The Illinois senator's choice of locations has been quintessential just-folks: a 4-H fairgrounds barn near South Bend, that family farm near tiny Union Mills, and on Friday, a steel plant in this town bordering Chicago.
\
But the Obama campaign is also placing a large political bet on his opposition to a gas-tax holiday -- an idea Clinton advisers predict will cement her advantage with working families.
\
Obama's outreach is significant not only because of Tuesday's primaries here and in North Carolina, but because both the Clinton campaign and that of Republican nominee Sen. John McCain have pointed to his weakness with that crucial swing group as potentially fatal in key states such as Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
\
The Obama campaign argues that white working-class voters already trend Republican and that Obama's appeal to independent and young voters and those turned off by traditional politics can expand the electoral playing field.
\
Poll data, both national and here in Indiana, shows the size of Obama's challenge. A poll released Friday by Survey USA showed Clinton leading Obama nearly 3-to-1 among Indiana primary voters with a high school education or less, and by substantial margins in income groups below $50,000, who make up nearly half the Indiana electorate. The poll, for researchers at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne, showed Clinton leading by seven percentage points in Indiana. Michael Wolf, a political science professor at the school, said it had been unclear whether white working-class voters, who trend Republican in Indiana, would vote Tuesday in the Democratic primary. But they make up a substantial portion of the likely Democratic electorate in the poll, he said. Nationally, a Pew Research Center poll released this week showed Clinton leading 65 percent to 25 percent among white voters with a high school diploma or less -- a 30-point jump in her advantage with that group from a month ago.
\
Geoff Garin, Clinton's chief strategist and pollster, told reporters this week that Obama's weakness with blue-collar voters is ""a settled feature"" of the political environment, one that should make the superdelegates who will decide the nomination question Obama's ability to win in the fall.
\
Obama laid out plenty of policy ideas aimed at working families, from a middle-class tax cut to skepticism on free-trade agreements to tougher enforcement of U.S. labor laws.
\
But it's the gas tax on which he has chosen to fight hardest. Clinton and McCain each has portrayed Obama as insensitive to hard-pressed families for opposing the tax holiday. But economists are almost uniformly dismissive of the idea, saying it will do little to help consumers and could be a windfall to oil companies.
\
""It turns out, people don't want to be for some political gimmick,"" Obama said, tying McCain and Clinton together as ""the two Washington candidates"" offering a politically expedient solution to soaring gas prices.
\
His campaign is airing two ads in Indiana focusing on the issue, hoping the ad blitz and critical media coverage will turn the issue to his advantage.
\
""He sounds genuine, like he's not just trying to do something to get votes,"" said Brian Hightower, a Lear Corp. employee from Gary and a UAW member.
\
David Axelrod, Obama's top strategist, said Friday that the Clinton campaign is gambling voters won't take the time to study the issue. ""Maybe they have a somewhat darker view of voters,"" Axelrod said. ""We've got more confidence in them than that.""

149,"Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told a U.S. Senate committee on Wednesday that increased federal investment in new roads and bridges is desperately needed but stopped short of making any suggestions about how it should be funded.\""I know it's a long-debated question,"" Whitmer told members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which will be part of discussions about how best to reauthorize and pay for infrastructure projects, including whether excise taxes on fuel should be increased for the first time in decades. ""I'm not here to answer the question on the federal gas tax.""\With more than 40% of the state's major roads in poor or mediocre condition, some 1,000 bridges in poor or critical condition and the average annual cost to Michigan motorists of car repairs, depreciation and wear and tear running more than $600, Whitmer said the need is great, however.\""There's no question we need a predictable, sustainable and sufficient (funding) solution,"" she said. ""Festering infrastructure problemsonly get harder to tackle and more expensive.""\Whitmer, Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, Denver Mayor Michael Hancock and Victoria Sheehan, New Hampshire's transportation commissioner and president of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, participated remotely in the hearing aimed at initiating discussion on infrastructure improvements while also addressing other issues, such as climate change.\With Democrats holding the White House and both chambers of Congress, it's expected that a large infrastructure improvement measure will be attempted. Whether it can overcome political differences — not just between parties but also among legislators from different regions and geographic settings — is an unsettled question.\In her remarks, Whitmer recounted briefly how after running on a campaign slogan that she would ""Fix the Damn Roads"" in Michigan, she was unable to reach a compromise with Republican legislators on how to increase the state's gas tax to fund her plans and had to turn to ""Plan B,"" which involves issuing $3.5 billion in bonds to rebuild critical highways and bridges in Michigan.\But with the most recent federal highway authorization expiring in September and no major infrastructure funding additions announced in recent years, it's unclear how a sweeping new authorization can be paid for.\Gas and diesel taxes were last raised in the 1990s and there is no political agreement on raising them again.\Meanwhile, the increased adoption of electric battery vehicles, while combating the emission of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, will further reduce fuel purchases, decreasing tax revenues.\As a result, some policymakers are calling for some way of charging drivers for the miles their vehicles travel. Others have called for increased tolls.\Both face opposition from some legislators and special interest groups, however. There are also questions about how to levy a miles-traveled tax.\Federal dollars typically account for a large percentage of the funds needed by states for road and bridge construction. But in recent years, as revenues from gas taxes have fallen, Congress has moved funding from its general tax receipts into the Highway Trust Fund to shore it up. Meanwhile, several lawmakers — and Whitmer — noted that more investment will be needed in electric vehicle charging stations.\While few policy specifics were discussed, several senators, including the chairman, Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., brought up General Motors' goal to make its entire lineup of new light-duty vehicles be zero emission, meaning they will be powered by electricity or hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.\Carper said when he spoke to GM CEO Mary Barra last year, she told him attaining widespread adoption of electric and electric-hybrid vehicles will require ensuring they can go hundreds of miles on a charge; charging times being brought down to minutes instead of hours; and a network of charging stations be made available across the U.S.\Whitmer said her administration is already working to improve a network of charging stations in Michigan and hopes tax incentives can be used to encourage drivers to adopt electric vehicles, including incentives that would encourage businesses with fleets of cars to start using them. Doing so, she said, would not only cut greenhouse gases but create jobs for automakers and those building that new infrastructure.\""I'll work with anyone who wants to build up our roads and bridges,"" Whitmer said, adding that lacking significant infrastructure investment Michigan business will struggle to remain competitive.\Contact Todd Spangler at tspangler@freepress.com.

150,"Nick Schirripa\The Enquirer\Job creation and fiscal responsibility have captured the attention of two men running for Calhoun County's District 6 board seat.\Republican Jase Bolger and Democrat Jon Schnaitman are campaigning for the seat Ron Ivey, R-Marshall, has held for more than 10 years.\Each candidate said more jobs are needed to boost the economy and relieve some of the financial strain felt by the county.\Bolger, a Marshall resident for the past 10 years, said his company has created 20 new jobs in the region, and he employs several Marshall graduates and other Calhoun County residents.\Although his company, Summit Credit Services, is in Kalamazoo, Bolger said it is vital to the entire region to create new jobs and attract other employers to the area while working within the current economy.\Bolger said the county should look for jobs by creating a competitive business environment and taking a leadership role to convince businesses to move here rather than overseas.\""Let's not let a sharp focus block a broad vision. Let's look at all the opportunities and those certainly include service jobs,"" he said. ""We need to talk to business owners and talk to decision makers. We need to sell Calhoun County.""\Some of the assets the county has to offer, Bolger said, include a lower cost of living than large cities, a talented and skilled work force and a high quality of life.\Schnaitman, a former 12-year employee of Marshall Brass Co., said potential business leaders need to be reassured they will not have to work through a lot of bureaucratic red tape to open an industrial company.\Much of that red tape, he said, is in the form of air quality controls.\Schnaitman said Calhoun County is part of the Kalamazoo Metropolitan Statistical Area and is included in air quality testing done in Kalamazoo.\Air quality in Calhoun County is affected by large cities on the other side of Lake Michigan, such as Chicago, as well as by Kalamazoo, Schnaitman said, which has a larger manufacturing base than Calhoun.\Schnaitman said it could take up to three years for a company to get the necessary operating permits, which would inhibit growth of employment opportunities and tax base.\""If we don't bring better jobs and more people into the district, me and the other people here are going to have to shoulder the burden of the property taxes,"" he said.\State shared revenue has been cut over the past several years, and both candidates said it is important to spend responsibly and closely monitor the budget.\""We have to balance the budget without raising taxes or cutting programs,"" Bolger said. ""It's tough, but it can be done. The key to solving the budget is having a healthy economy.""\Bolger said the key to creating a healthy economy involves job creation and retention.\""In the interim, we ask our families and every business to do more with less,"" he said. ""I think it's only fair to ask our government to do the same thing, and make do with less.""\Schnaitman said he intends to push state and federal legislators for more gas tax funds.\He said Michigan is receiving 88 cents for every $1 of federal gas tax received by the state; he said the state should be getting about 95 cents for each $1.\The additional funding - which would require the approval of the U.S. Congress - would be used for more road construction, he said, as many roads in the rural areas of the district are in disrepair.\Bolger said the senior millage, specifically the prescription program, should be a top priority of the county.\But as the county provides such services as the prescription program, dental services, home-delivered meals, transportation and in-home services, he said, there is a need to continually evaluate the needs and wants of the seniors and community.\""I will work to protect our senior prescription drug program,"" he said. ""The federal and state governments have said they will help our seniors. The citizens and previous leaders in Calhoun County have stood up and done something, and we should protect this benefit.""\Schnaitman said he has not researched the senior millage and related programs yet, but he wants to look into them before deciding how to proceed.\""When my father was in office in 1975 and `76, he spearheaded the committee for the aging,"" he said. ""I learned a lot from him then, and with the baby boomers getting older, we're going to see more seniors than we've ever had.""\BREAKOUT\JASE BOLGER\* AGE: 33\* OCCUPATION: President and CEO, Summit Credit Services Inc., Kalamazoo.\* PARTY: Republican\* EDUCATION: Bachelor's degree in business administration, dual major in finance and political science, Western Michigan University.\* POLITICAL EXPERIENCE: Marshall Area Chamber of Commerce Board; campaign chairman, Mike Nofs for State Representative.\* FAMILY: Wife, Molly, and two children\* HOME: Marshall\* WEB SITE: www.electbolger.com\JON SCHNAITMAN\* AGE: 48\* OCCUPATION: Unemployed, former supervisor and purchaser for Marshall Brass Co.\* PARTY: Democratic\* EDUCATION: Marshall Public Schools; certificates of accreditation in problem solving and project management from Kellogg Community College\* POLITICAL EXPERIENCE: None\* FAMILY: Wife, Sharon, and three children\* HOME: Marshall\* WEB SITE: None"

153,"LANSING – Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Wednesday she won't sign a budget that doesn't include a real plan to fix the state's roads and Republicans have still not presented her with one.\But House Speaker Lee Chatfield, R-Levering, said it is the governor who is holding up the process by refusing to ""drop her insistence on a 45-cent gas tax"" as a budget centerpiece.\And Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, said his caucus is ready to finalize a budget without a road funding deal, which he said can be handled separately.\Whitmer's budget director, Chris Kolb, said the administration is preparing for a possible partial government shutdown on Oct. 1 by determining what critical functions would have to continue and what resources would be needed to support them.\""You should ask the Republican leadership to show you their plan,"" Whitmer said at a news conference.\""It's time for them to offer up something that is a legitimate alternative,"" she said.\""Stop screwing around and get it done.""\Whitmer delivered her message with just over a month to go before the Oct. 1 start of the 2020 fiscal year — the deadline for having an approved budget in place.\Whitmer has repeatedly blasted Republican lawmakers for taking an extended summer break without sending her a budget that includes a realistic plan to fix Michigan roads. House and Senate Republicans, who have each come up with their own budget plans that still need to be melded into a unified proposal, insist they have continued to work on road funding plans throughout the summer and have been in regular contact with the governor.\They also say that each of their budgets include record funding for K-12 schooling.\Republicans presented Whitmer last week with what has been described as a ""menu of options"" for increasing road funding. Whitmer says GOP leaders gave her ""an unacceptable proposal that will cut education spending by $400 per pupil statewide and doesn't raise the revenue we need to fix the roads.""\Chatfield said GOP leaders have presented Whitmer with a range of options for increasing road funding, but Whitmer asked that their conversations be kept confidential. He said he plans to honor his commitment not to discuss the road funding negotiations in the media.\At the same time, ""we cannot hold the budget hostage because of her desire to tax every driver in our state,"" Chatfield said.\Shirkey accused Whitmer of manufacturing a crisis.\""I'm willing to continue to talk,"" Shirkey said. ""But we have to pivot and also progress on a budget because the citizens of Michigan deserve the certainty of a budget being done.""\Shirkey said even without a road funding deal, Republicans will present a budget with ""record spending for ... education and additional funding for roads."" Also, ""she'll have the budget in plenty of time,"" he said.\The governor has specifically rejected proposals to borrow against school pension funds or to free up extra money by delaying some pension fund payments.\Whitmer's proposal to raise Michigan's fuel tax by 45 cents per gallon is estimated to increase transportation funding by $2.5 billion a year. The net increase for roads under Whitmer's plan would be closer to $1.9 billion because she would shift about $600 million in general fund revenues now targeted for roads back into other priority areas, such as higher education and the environment.\Increasingly, Whitmer is citing the significant number of closed or compromised bridges around the state and the potential threat to public safety, not just from a potential bridge failure but from lengthy detours that emergency vehicles are forced to take as a result of bridge closures. She also said lousy roads are a threat to Michigan's business climate generally and its plans to be a national center for development of automated vehicles, specifically.\State Rep. Jason Sheppard, R-Temperance, said Wednesday a 45-cent-per-gallon gas tax hike would ""shutter small businesses, like gas stations, as drivers head to Ohio to fill up their tanks.""\Sheppard said Michigan motorists can't afford Whitmer's plan and it is not a plan for the long haul since gasoline consumption is expected to decline as a result of more fuel-efficient vehicles and ones that are powered by alternative fuel sources.\A key element of the House Republican plan would remove the 6% sales tax from fuel sales, thereby making room for a significant fuel tax hike without increasing the overall price of a gallon of gas.\Michigan is one of only a handful of states that apply their full sales tax to fuel sales. That's seen as major problem by those who believe all revenues raised from taxes on fuel sales should be devoted to transportation. Michigan fuel taxes go to transportation spending. Sales tax revenues mostly support K-12 education and local governments.\Assuming a pump price of $3 per gallon, about 16 cents of the Michigan pump price is sales tax. Removing the sales tax and replacing it with a 16-cent fuel tax hike would raise about $736 million extra for roads, without increasing the price of fuel. Removing the sales tax and using increased fuel taxes to hike the overall pump price by 10 cents a gallon would raise about $1.2 billion extra for transportation.\Of the $840 million in sales tax now collected at the pump, $627 million goes to the School Aid Fund and $81.3 million goes to local governments, according to the Citizens Research Council of Michigan.\Whitmer told the Free Press editorial board on Tuesday she is open to removing the sales tax from fuel sales, but only if the plan includes replacement revenue for schools and local governments. So far, what the Republicans have offered does not come close to doing that, she said.\""If the Republicans were serious about raising the revenue to fill that hole, that's clearly something I would be open to,"" she said.\Whitmer\CREDIT: Paul Egan; Kathleen Gray"
154,"Chrysler LLC's top executives said Thursday they're meeting their internal goals and counseled patience as they re-create the Auburn Hills automaker as a smaller company. They offered no expectation for earning a profit this year and expressed concerns about the economy into 2009.\""There seems to be an expectation or desire that the company will take some elixir or there's some new coat of paint that you can put on the building or something like that, that instantaneously tomorrow it's a different company,"" said Jim Press, Chrysler president and vice chairman.\""Lesser companies would have buckled,"" Chief Executive Officer Bob Nardelli said of the struggles Chrysler has faced in the past year.\During a meeting with Free Press reporters and editors, Press, Nardelli and Tom LaSorda, also a president and vice chairman, said that:\*5,600 to 6,000 of the 10,000 hourly workers the company wants to shed this year were granted buyouts or retirement packages in the first quarter.\*The surprise tentative labor agreement between the Canadian Auto Workers and Ford Motor Co. reached this week appears to fall short of what Chrysler thinks is competitive. CAW President Buzz Hargrove has said the deal would serve as the pattern for new agreements with Chrysler and General Motors Corp.\*The streamlining of Chrysler's product lineup, which is driving dealer consolidation efforts, will not happen in one fell swoop. Think five to seven years.\*A summer holiday from the federal gas tax is unhealthy and inconsistent with new fuel-economy regulations.\Press preached patience, noting that the three leaders are working to stabilize the company and prepare it for growth.\""These are global structural issues where we're competing with companies in other countries, in other worlds, in other environments,"" Press said. ""We can and will be as good or better than they are, but it takes time to develop these products. It takes time to develop the manufacturing. It takes time for the technology. It takes time to shape the dealership organization.""\An eventful year\Nearly a year ago, private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management was ushered in as troubled Chrysler's savior. It gave assurances that the change would provide the automaker's future with strength and stability.\Since August, when the deal was closed, Chrysler has undergone sweeping changes with the addition of new leadership, including Nardelli and Press. The company made more job cuts, as many as 12,000 on top of 13,000 already planned; eliminated four products, and added a new partner. Nissan Motor Co. will build small cars for Chrysler to sell in North America, and Chrysler will make pickups for Nissan.\""As long as you have money, it's OK"" to have patience, said David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor. ""They're doing essentially what I think they have to do, is to try to leverage their assets and be more sharply focused than typically some people have to be in this industry. But they really are faced with a different set of circumstances than some of the others.""\Van Conway, a turnaround expert from the Birmingham-based consulting firm Conway MacKenzie & Dunleavy, agreed it will take Chrysler's new team a while to turn around the business.\""It's a huge company, and if you want to turn around a huge company given what they're facing, it's not going to happen in a quarter or two,"" he said. ""I don't think you can go in there and say, 'Let's fix it.' ""\By the financial, sales numbers\Daimler AG, which kept a 19.9% stake in Chrysler, announced Tuesday that the value of its share in Chrysler had dropped nearly two-thirds since the August deal.\Also, Daimler's financial filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission seem to indicate that Chrysler lost $6.8 billion, primarily in the final five months of 2007, under European accounting standards used by Daimler.\Chrysler argues that using European rather than U.S. accounting standards to gauge how it is doing paints a distorted view of its business. Experts say it provides a relevant look into Chrysler's finances.\Although Chrysler has provided little guidance on its finances, a view more in line with its accounting practices might be to include the $1.6 billion Nardelli has said Chrysler lost in its operations last year plus the $1.3 billion the February turnaround plan was believed to cost.\Chrysler's sales this year are down 18% compared with last year at this time.\Major parts of Chrysler's turnaround plan involve cutting back on workers and streamlining the number of vehicles it makes.\As many as 6,000 UAW members were granted buyout or retirement packages to leave the company in the first three months of this year, LaSorda said. He estimated that those people should be finished departing in the next month or so.\Chrysler is attempting to cut its hourly workforce by as many as 10,000 this year. ""We have never missed a reduction plan target, so I would not expect that we would miss this one, either,"" LaSorda said.\In March, UAW Vice President General Holiefield said he didn't think Chrysler would get 10,000 takers because of the troubled economy.\Lineup reduction to take 5-7 years\Press gave greater insight into how Chrysler's planned vehicle lineup reduction will play out. ""You'll see some of it in five years and seven years. ... It's evolving as the new products come out,"" he said.\Press has told Bloomberg that Chrysler could cut its lineup of 11 SUVs in half and has indicated changes to the automaker's two minivans.\""We don't have - don't need to have - the resources allocated to produce two or three vehicles that really cater to the same customer base,"" Press said Thursday.\""We're one company. So we can expand our footprint, our coverage of our products by adding product in the B-segment and ... over time as we go through the model change cycles, we'll be morphing some products out and bringing some products in, and in general we'll have fewer products in the portfolio.\""By doing that, the three brands will have more distinctiveness and they won't be competing with each other.""\Last month, Chrysler and Nissan announced a partnership to share some specific vehicle platforms, allowing Chrysler to sell a Nissan-made small car - the so-called B-segment - in North America and elsewhere without the expense of coming up with its own platform.\In return, Chrysler will make Nissan a pickup based on the Dodge Ram for the Japanese company to sell in the United States.\""We're excited about that. We're very excited about the continuation of discussions with Nissan,"" Nardelli said. ""I hope ... the industry would see that as a tremendous vote of confidence in Chrysler. ... It speaks volumes, I think, about their confidence in our ability to produce that vehicle and the longevity of Chrysler.""\A bounce in their step\On Wednesday, Chrysler's top 300 executives met to talk about how the company is doing, Nardelli said.\""They went out with a bounce in their step. We shared with them where we are and where we want to go,"" Nardelli said. ""I would hope you see that as a solid message again for Chrysler, for Detroit, for the auto industry, for America.""\Nardelli again noted that Chrysler has met or exceeded every metric provided to investors in August, including ending 2007 with $1 billion more cash on hand than expected.\As the first privately held major U.S. automaker in more than 50 years, Chrysler is not required to provide details about its finances. What little is known comes from Daimler's reporting and occasional statement - or misstatement - from Chrysler executives.\""There is a lot of discussion about the health of Chrysler LLC and the ability to sustain operations, etc. We're not where we want to be over the long haul. But we are exactly on plan or better relative to our return to profitability,"" Nardelli said.\Contact TIM HIGGINS at 313-222-8784 or thiggins@freepress.com.\(SIDEBAR)\Chrysler's Big Three\Bob Nardelli\Chairman and chief executive officer\Responsibilities: Oversees the entire company.\Born: May 17, 1948, in Old Forge, Pa.\Education: Bachelor of science, Western Illinois University, 1971; master's in business administration, University of Louisville, 1975.\Career: General Electric - Went to work at GE in 1971 and rose through the ranks to high-level jobs, such as CEO of GE Transportation Systems in 1992 and CEO of GE Power Systems in 1995.

Do you support the ""complete streets"" concept that advocates planning for appropriate sidewalks and bike lanes as part of road projects?
\
Add fiber optic conduits
\
While they're at it, include fiber optic conduit to make it viable to run broadband to unserved and underserved parts of our state. Michigan Department of Transportation is doing this and local governments should follow suit. Michigan's recovery requires upgrading our state's information technology infrastructure as well as our roads.

Make city accommodating
\
I wholeheartedly support the ""complete streets"" concept because it is an idea that is forward thinking. Complete streets is much more than making bike lanes. It's about sustainable living communities making our roadways safer and more accommodating for seniors, bicyclists, parents with strollers etc. I would love to see many more people biking than riding in automobiles. More information can be found at www.completestreets.org.

An inexpensive improvement
\
Making bike paths and better sidewalks would be a definite plus for Lansing. It would encourage people to exercise more, and help to make it a better looking, more inviting city for folks considering moving here. Since it would be incorporated into projects without any major additional cost, it's an inexpensive way to improve our city.

What's not to like?
\
I like it; I think it's a good idea. We live in Delta Township, a very walker and biker friendly community. We can easily bike or walk to the Lansing Mall, the library and a host of businesses and restaurants along Saginaw. Having sidewalks and bike lanes enhances the safety of pedestrians, bikers and motorists. Biking and walking are healthy activities, not driving short distances saves on gas and helps the environment. What's not to like about ""complete streets""?
\
Dan Lynch
\
Delta Township
\
Make city more cosmopolitan
\
Yes! In order for Lansing to become a community that will draw young families it must become more cosmopolitan. Leaders can begin by making better use of its riverfront, and by creating a walkable/bikeable community that includes neighborhood convenience stores. Many communities have been successful in doing this and Lansing needs to catch up. They should also put more effort into keeping sidewalks and streets cleared in the winter to encourage residents to use public transportation and to walk/bike to work.
\
June Pallottini

\
Coordinate across region
\
Yes, I believe in programs that encourage people to get out and walk or bike. We should also include trail systems in this discussion. A key to success is to establish long range plans for specific routes and install increments as opportunities present themselves. Only designated roads will need the additional facilities. Routes should be coordinated between governmental units so for example, I might be able to bike from DeWitt to MSU.

\
Put it to a vote
\
No. Our streets and roads are paid for by gas tax, which means only by motor vehicles operators. Already money is diverted for public transportation projects and bike paths. If the public (not a vocal few) wants complete streets, then it must be willing to pay the taxes necessary to do the projects. Put it to a vote, just like other millage projects and see how much support it has.

Wait for recovery
\
This could be an idea to consider when the Michigan economy rebounds. The government, like each individual, has only so much income. Our priorities need to be in line with that income. When we spend above our income we wind up with financial turmoil and devastation down the road. As one wise man said, when your outgo exceeds your income, your upkeep will be your downfall!
\
Randy Parlor

\
A misallocation of money
\
No. Our politicians won't even appropriate enough money to patch the potholes or resurface old streets so why should we make new streets more expensive? I have been driving on Pleasant Grove Street since 1967 and just last week for the first time saw a biker using a bike lane. If bikers who want bike lanes were required to pay an annual user fee to provide the entire cost of installing and maintaining bike lanes not a single one of them would want to pay. This is just another example of government misallocation of resources by spending more than users find something is worth.
\
Joe Sanger

\
Good for health and environment
\
I fully support this. Enabling people to drive less can positively impact health, and definitely impact the environment. I recently did a calculation for Meridian Township using 2000 U.S. Census data. If half of the two-car households drove one gallon of gas per week for one year, the township could reduce the carbon emissions by more than 17 million pounds per year. As to property values, premiums are being paid in numerous areas of the United States for less auto dependent residential and commercial properties. A 2006 AAA study found the average cost of owning a car was $7,900 plus per year, in after tax dollars. So in the 20 percent tax bracket, $10,000 needs to be made to support a car; that same $10,000 would support a 30 year mortgage of $135,000 at 6 percent interest. Hard to see a downside to ""complete streets.""

\
Seems like common sense
\
Because roadways, sidewalks and bike lanes go hand in hand, so to speak, it seems like common sense to incorporate them into any planning for road projects. More people are walking and biking and the safety factor alone should be a high priority. Then there is the cost factor. Do it now, not down the road after bureaucrats and whiners and complainers have caused delays. This is a concept whose time has truly come.
\
Bonnie Gurzenda
\
Dansville
\
Not too many bike lanes
\
No, I support sidewalks which has turned into an issue here in our area for people losing lives. I don't necessarily want to see bike lanes as an automatic everywhere. Bike lanes around campus and schools are appropriate but I have noticed that safety and knowing the proper way to ride a bike on the road is an issue. I don't want to see unnecessary injuries in high traffic areas.

Healthy and inviting
\
Spacious well-maintained roads and pathways through a city with equal consideration for motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians. What's not to love? Added benefits include encouraging healthy lifestyles and reducing pollution downtown. As Lansing strives to create more hospitable urban venues with upscale condos, a developed riverfront and trendy nightspots, it only makes sense to continue the ambiance with inviting boulevards.

158,"Michigan has the worst roads in the country.\And virtually everyone — I mean, everyone, from the right-leaning Mackinac Center for Public Policy, to the 21st Century Infrastructure Commission impaneled by former Gov. Rick Snyder, to the new state transportation director appointed by Snyder's successor, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — agrees that it will cost the state about $2.6 billion a year more than it's spending now to fix them.\Now four retired Michigan legislative leaders — two Republicans and two Democrats — have unveiled a plan to raise the whole $2.6 billion, plus an extra $100 million a year for local roads, by hiking the state's fuel tax 47 cents a gallon over the next nine years, beginning with a 7-cent bump in 2020.\Innovative? Hardly: The per-gallon fuel tax is the same well the state tapped the last two times it boosted road funding, in 1997 and 2017.\Forward-looking? To the contrary: Taxing gas and diesel fuel more heavily would exacerbate Michigan's dependency on fossil fuels just as the global auto industry is pivoting to electric vehicles.\And politically, the retired legislators' proposal is bound to disappoint everyone from fiscal conservatives, for whom any tax is anathema, to progressives, who think the financial burden should fall hardest on businesses who enjoyed big tax cuts over the past decade while the state's roads languished.\So why, I asked former Republican Senate Majority Leader Ken Sikkema Wednesday, do he and his former legislative colleagues think anyone will rally around their plan?\""Because Michigan has the worst roads in the country,"" Sikkema answered. ""And fixing them is only going to get more expensive.""\Sikkema has a point. And the straightforward simplicity of the plan he and former Democratic Senate Minority Leader Bob Emerson outlined in a meeting with the Free Press editorial board may be its strongest selling point in a state where anger over roads has reached a boiling point.\The legislative veterans behind the plan — besides Sikkema and Emerson, the quartet includes former Republican House Speaker Paul Hillegonds and former Senate minority leader John Cherry — did not fall off a horse-drawn turnip truck.\As a group, they represent more than eight decades of legislative experience. Cherry and Emerson also served in Gov. Jennifer Granholm's administration: Cherry as lieutenant governor and Emerson as state treasurer.\The four began meeting last June under the auspices of the non-profit Center for Michigan, with the objective of proposing solutions to the state's hairiest public policy challenges that could command the support of elected officials in both parties.\But Sikkema and Emerson, the group's co-chairs, both cautioned me against describing their alliance as bipartisan.\""We're a partisan state, and our government is organized along partisan lines,"" Sikkema said. ""Our challenge is to find consensus in that partisan environment.""\Toward that end, the group set out last summer to find a roads funding solution that would raise the extra $2.6 billion a year everyone agrees is needed, and avoid as many political trip wires as possible.\The per-gallon gas tax was a revenue source with several obvious advantages:\It is an existing mechanism whose proceeds were already allocated according to a long-established distribution formula that took into account both the diverse needs of Michigan residents and the political realities confronting their elected representatives.\It was not tied directly to the price of gas and diesel fuel; although consumer demand tends to diminish during a sustained spike in pump prices, a fill-up generated the same revenue whether dealers were charging $2 a gallon or $4.\History demonstrated that motorists could tolerate incremental gas tax increases, whose impact was sometimes muted, or at least camouflaged, by ordinary fluctuations in the market price of fuel.\Finally, annual increases of just 5 cents a gallon after the first year would gradually generate more and more revenue, allowing the state and private contractors to increase their capacity at incremental pace that moderated the cost of materials and labor.\In the briefing at the Free Press, Sikkema and Emerson suggested that few motorists remember the last time legislators raised fuel taxes 7 cents a gallon, although that increase took effect just two years ago this month.\Even if drivers had to absorb another 7-cent-per-gallon increase today, the ex-legislators noted, most drivers would still pay less for a fill-up than they paid a year ago, when gas prices were higher.\The former legislative leaders did venture one creative tweak — a one-time 2-cent increase to fund a $100-million fund that local governments could tap to rebuild local roads not supervised by the state, provided the locals ponied up funds to match any state contribution.\Beyond assuring adequate funding for road reconstruction, the quartet labored to avoid as many complications as possible.\To objections that a fuel tax hike would be regressive, taking a disproportionate bite of smaller incomes, the former legislators answered: This is about roads; we'll tackle tax reform another time.\To those who pointed out that any tax on gas and diesel seemed likely to generate less and less revenue as manufacturers and consumers moved to more fuel-efficient vehicles, they responded: None of us has a crystal ball. Let's work with the vehicle mix and funding mechanisms we have now, and let future Legislatures adjust to changes in technology and consumer demand as they happen.\And to skeptics who suggested they had grossly overestimated the blowback Michigan's current generation of elected leaders are willing to tolerate in pursuit of better roads, they shrugged: If someone knows an easier way to raise $2.6 billion, we'll endorse it.\But so far, they add, all Michigan's elected leaders have delivered to their constituents are the worst roads in America.\Brian Dickerson is the Free Press' editorial page editor.\Brian Dickerson\Editorial Page Editor\Detroit Free Press\USA TODAY NETWORK\Potholes are plentiful on Charest Street in Hamtramck in 2015.\Ryan Garza/Detroit Free Press\Brian Dickerson\Editorial Page Editor\Detroit Free Press\USA TODAY NETWORK\Former Democratic Senate Minority Leader Bob Emerson.\Romain Blanquart\Former Republican Senate Majority Leader Ken Sikkema.\Salwan Georges/\Detroit Free Press"
159,"Carol Campbell: The middle class is disappearing while the safety net for the poor is being shredded. The new tax law will take away most deductions used by the middle class, especially targeting pensions of seniors, as well as cutting essential revenue sharing to cities, townships and counties. State contributions to public schools as well as funds for public safety have been drastically cut while 1.8 billion dollars was given to corporations without any requirement to create jobs. I will vote to repeal these taxes and restore funding for schools and public safety by asking those whose incomes are at the top levels to pay their fair share.\Bob Eick: The No. 1 challenge is the lingering recession and its impact on the lack of job growth. I plan to work closely with the local business leaders in order to get their ideas and solutions on the table for growth. By working together we can discover the best practices. We can utilize business owner's creativity to begin to deliver results. We must identify whether there is too much regulation and the other ways government hinders growth. Then, by getting government out of the way, we can allow businesses to recover, prosper and create more jobs.\Paul Muxlow: I believe Jobs and the economy are the greatest challenges facing my constituents and the state of Michigan as a whole. I plan to continue on the path we have taken in the legislature to create an environment geared for job creators to thrive and prosper both creating jobs and encouraging residents to remain in Michigan. To date significant progress has been made, however we still have a long way to go and I plan to aid in legislation to continue this positive trend.\Michigan's roads need fixing. How will we get the money to do it?\Campbell: There is no question that Michigan's roads need to be fixed, but fairness must guide our solution. Increasing the gas tax will not be welcomed by tourists, one of the state's main industries, while being an added burden on the struggling poor. At the same time, newer vehicles get better mileage and there are more electric battery-powered cars or non-liquid gas-powered vehicles paying little or no tax. I would recognize and promote local solutions like Sanilac County's road millage program while aggressively working to bring more state tax dollars to fix roads in this area plus more federal money back to Michigan.\Eick: The first step is to stop the diversion of transportation funding to non-transportation activities. Inter-departmental grants to the MDNR, MDEQ and the DOS take away needed transportation dollars from roadway repair. The transportation dollars must only be spent on transportation infrastructure. The fund diversions must be stopped before any tax or fee increase is considered.\Muxlow: The very issue of funding for road and bridge repair was a topic of discussion during the last legislative session. Remedies being considered for the funding shortfall are placing a wholesale tax on gasoline at the distributor level and an increase on vehicle registration fees, with an increase in registration fees being less favored. Myself and the other legislators are conscious of the recovering economy and desire to refrain from a tax increase.\How would you assure local officials who face the loss of personal property tax revenue?\Campbell: I would work to repeal or replace this measure as soon as possible. Although the intent seems to have been to stimulate business growth, it was short-sighted in not recognizing how the personal property tax is helpful to business in the use of this revenue to help established businesses as well as attracting new ones, especially by the support of needed infrastructure. But the real impact is to the whole community in the loss of absolutely essential revenue for public safety (police, prison workers, fire fighters and EMS), public schools and many other services and programs that must be supported.\Eick: The loss of the PPT will again add to the shortfall of revenue at the local level where services matter most. The plan to replace the revenue by the State is still unclear. The formula of replacing all but up to 2% of the locals general fund budget will once again shift the tax burden from the State to the locals. The priority must be the 100% replacement of the PPT in order to maintain vital local services.\Muxlow: Loss of personal and industrial property tax revenue plagues the state and our district is not immune from this phenomenon. In dealing with receding tax revenue we must turn to the general fund of the state government to fill the gap.\What actions should be taken to increase job creation in the area?\Campbell: Companies are attracted to an area not only by the business climate but by the community as a whole; for example, taxes are not the most important consideration in locating a business to a particular community. Continued promotion is essential. Some important assets include: good, safe transportation including access to Canada and the Great Lakes, a pool of skilled workers (importance of good schools, raising the high school graduation rate, technical schools as well as colleges), activities and ambiance for young professionals as well as families (boating and all the wonders of Lake Huron, athletic teams, concerts and lectures at McMorran) a vibrant history including the Fort Gratiot Light House and the Light House Ship, good hospitals and health care, including community services.\Eick: Again, by working directly with the local business leadership we can identify the best way to create job growth. By developing a local dialogue specific to the Blue Water Area we can discover the business sectors for the best growth potential. Local stakeholders can offer the creativity and innovation needed to stimulate growth. Government can work to end ""over the top"" regulations and continue to improve the business environment and needed infrastructure.\Muxlow: Many economists have agreed the Michigan Business Tax (MBT) was a very negative and restrictive tax on job creators. With the removal of the MBT the economy in Michigan has improved significantly over the last year due in part to the creation of a better environment for the people that produce jobs. Thousands of new jobs have been posted and unemployment is at a four year low. Although this is a step in the right direction we must continue to reduce regulations along with also facilitating a business climate that promotes the growth of industry and plants that can process Michigan's raw commodities.\How will you make sure the Blue Water Area's voice is heard in Lansing?\Campbell: I will promote this area by working to get on committees that most affect this area such as Agriculture, Education and Transportation. Our international border crossing could not be more important, not only to this area but to the state's economy as well as that of the nation. I will work to promote the inclusion of St. Clair and Sanilac Counties into state tourism promotion materials. It will also be important for me to communicate what is happening in Lansing via newsletter as well as scheduling times for you to share your concerns with me.\Eick: Of all my priorities, staying connected to the district is critical. I plan to schedule regular office hours, coffee-sessions, participate in local stakeholder meetings on the vital issues and stay involved in the district. The Blue Water Area deserves a stronger voice, one that understands the local issues. The best way to know the local issues is by working directly the constituents in the district.\Muxlow: The interests of the Blue Water Area have always been a priority of mine as the 83rd as our district is largely comprised of its residents. I have been in communication with community leaders and members over the past year and have always made a point of listening and reacting to their questions and concerns. Staying in touch with the areas constituents and leaders will continue to remain a priority for me, as I will continue to introduce and vote on legislation in a way that best represents Blue Water Area residents.\83rd State Representative\Carol Campbell (D)\Age: 73\Address: 7755 Lakeview, Lexington\Occupation: Retired\Political experience: None\Family: Husband, Robert; three children, Anne, Matt and Dave\Bob Eick (R)\Age: 55\Address: 3653 Connie Lane, Fort Gratiot\Occupation: Retired\Political experience: Lexington village councilman 1990-92\Family: Wife, Kimm; son, Travis, 20\Paul Muxlow (R)\Age: 74\Address: 4473 Parkside Dr., Brown City\Occupation: State representative\Political experience: Currently serving as state representative\Family: Wife, Liz; children, Jeffrey, Douglas and Matthew; three grandchildren"
160,"Not until we have someone dear to us wind up in prison do most of us ever care about what goes on inside of one. Stories such as Paul Egan's shed a lot of light on the heartbreaking conditions in Michigan prisons which often lead to suicide.\According to state legislators, prison reforms are underway, but they seem to center more on sentencing rather than actually addressing inhumane prison conditions, and as anyone having direct contact with a prisoner today knows, prison life is positively horrendous. In terms of providing edible food, sensible health care, positive programs and a sense of hope, prison administrators have soundly missed the mark. Little attention is paid to the psychological and physical well-being of inmates.\Due to an inequitable judicial system, there are far too many — young and old, men and women — incarcerated who should not be imprisoned in the first place, and those who cannot afford legal recourse or lack familial support can rot in prison for decades, even when they have proven, beyond a doubt, they are no threat to society. This is barbaric, and who really cares?\One way leaders at the top can correct these injustices is by re-instituting the lost concept of rehabilitation, and adopting all the measures that philosophy embraces. One wonders what it will take to rouse them from their lethargy and inspire them to confront such inhumane conditions head on.\Where there is the will, problems do have solutions!\Pat Hardy\Bloomfield Hills\On April 27, my partner and I (both senior citizens) were traveling to a bridge tournament at the Doherty Hotel in Clare. We were on I-275 when our car blew a tire just south of the Seven Mile Road exit. We attempted to change the tire but the car slid off the jack just when we were attempting to put on the spare. Not knowing what to do about our dilemma we next called 911, which transferred our call to MDOT. In less than 15 minutes an MDOT courtesy vehicle arrived. The driver was courteous and quickly used his equipment to put the spare tire on our car. He refused to take any money for his professional services. Because of his quick and efficient intervention we were able to get to our destination on time.\We want to thank and commend the Michigan Department of Transportation for providing such a helpful and worthy service. We would have gladly paid a fee for this rescuing service. It's great to be a Michigan resident!\Daniel Dankoff\Plymouth\The Republican bill does not fix Michigan's auto insurance problem. Canceling coverage doesn't reduce fraud. Canceling coverage doesn't reduce overcharging and non-driving penalties. Canceling coverage doesn't reduce costs for those unwilling to risk driving without coverage and might increase costs by shrinking the pool. But most pertinent of all, caps on coverage merely dumps victims on the taxpayers once their money runs out.\It would be a lot harder for corrupt legislators to pass bills that protect the insurance industry, rather than the people who elect them if the media would list the donors alongside the legislators who vote for disingenuous bills, such as the Republican auto insurance ""reform"" bill presently being passed. When all we get is quotations from each side, it's the same as social media re-posting the comments of others. Long paragraphs are too intimidating; better is a list of what's in, and a list of what's needed and not in.\And where, may I ask, is the Democrat bill for reforming auto insurance? Yes, the Republican controlled Legislature may ignore it, but the newspapers might print it anyway. Minority rule by gerrymander is coming to an end in 2020 (or sooner if there's any integrity left in the Republican stacked courts). Insurance reform may not be possible until we first get government reform that makes legislators less insulated from the people who elect them.\Dennis L. Green\Farmington Hills\In Michigan, nearly 1 million children benefit from the state's child support program. Child support is vitally important to children and families. To thrive, children need financial support and emotional support from both parents.\A proposal in Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's fiscal year 2020 budget would promote child support collection and result in an additional $2.6 million in child support payments to children and families. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services keeps child support payments that would be paid to parents who receive cash assistance to offset program costs. However, rather than retain that money, federal law permits states to ""pass through"" to the family those payments.\The budget proposal recommends $946,000 to cover child support pass-through payments of up to $200 a month for families with two or more children and up to $100 a month for families with one child for households receiving cash assistance.\Issuing this pass-through will improve the effectiveness of the child support program as a poverty-reducing program and improve the lives of Michigan's children and families. Under this proposal, families would receive an additional $2.6 million in fiscal year 2020, rather than that money going to reimburse state and federal costs.\This modest investment will have a substantial return for Michigan children and families.\Erin Frisch\Director, Michigan Office of Child Support\We've got soldiers coming home in pieces from the Middle East to protect our access to cheap oil and gas, and anyone has the nerve to whine about a gas tax?\Anyone has the nerve to drive gas-guzzling vehicles, ensuring that soldiers have to keep going overseas to enable this addiction?\The price we pay for gasoline is a fraction of what countries in Europe have been paying for decades.\Stop driving vehicles that require gas.

The Detroit News
\
Michigan needs $5.6 billion in the next four years to maintain the roads it already has, let alone build new ones or widen highways that are congested.
\
And by 2023, according to Legislature-sponsored research, the need for more road money nearly doubles.
\
That's a huge obstacle in the way of this state's climb out of a decade-long recession. Good roads tell the world Michigan is open for business. Bad ones boggle commerce and convey the image of a state still living in the past.
\
""Michigan's infrastructure is living on borrowed time,"" Gov. Rick Snyder said in a special message to lawmakers while rolling out a comprehensive plan for improving the state's roads and bridges in late October. ""We must reinvest in it if we are to reinvent our economy.""
\
The solution, however, has remained elusive.
\
A case for bolder investment in Michigan roads was made in a 2010 Anderson Engineering Group report commissioned by the Michigan Chamber of Commerce. The Anderson report said spending $4.37 billion a year on road improvements would provide better support for the state's manufacturing, tourism and agriculture industries, and, as a bonus, create 15,000 jobs.
\
""The results of this analysis are clear: the benefits to the state and its residents are very large, and far offset the cost of the higher gas taxes necessary to support that expenditure,"" wrote company CEO Patrick L. Anderson in a forward to the report.
\
Problems abound
\
The problem increased when a Senate committee last month rejected Snyder's proposed new international bridge linking freeways in Detroit and Windsor. That project included a pact with the White House in which Canada would have paid Michigan's $550 million share of the work, yet the state would be able to count that as part of its matching money for federal transportation funds. The state currently spends $3 billion a year on infrastructure.
\
Now, because of declining road revenue from the fuel tax and vehicle registration fees, Michigan can't raise enough state money to draw its full annual allotment of federal transportation funds. About $2 billion in federal funds is at risk over the next few years unless lawmakers come up with an added revenue source to fill the hole.
\
The state chamber has favored a gradual increase in the state gasoline tax. The Legislature last boosted the gas tax in 1997 -- to 19 cents a gallon from 15 cents a gallon -- with support from then-Gov. John Engler. But neither the GOP legislative majority nor Snyder is interested in reprising that approach this year.
\
Michigan also suffers because of its archaic distribution formula, which favors funding based on road miles over traffic volumes, spreads state money among 617 road agencies in Michigan.
\
The Citizens Research Council found that in 2006, the formula resulted in a distribution of state road funds at a rate of $270 per resident in low-population Baraga County in the Upper Peninsula, while populous Wayne County received the equivalent of $89 per resident. Engler sought a formula revision that would distribute the funding more efficiently, but it was defeated in the Legislature.
\
Wholesale change needed
\
Instead, Snyder's proposals include:
\
Replacing the flat 19-cents-a-gallon state gasoline tax and 15-cents-a-gallon diesel tax with a percentage fuel tax levied on wholesalers. The new tax, with upper and lower limits to reduce volatility, would increase state revenues with inflation.
\
A possible hike in motor vehicle registration fees -- he tossed out the idea without necessarily recommending it. His example suggested the state could realize about $1 billion more in road revenue if everybody's registration fees went up by $10 per month, or $120 per year, per vehicle.
\
Law changes letting counties, municipalities or metropolitan regions tack on their own special vehicle registration fees to raise more money for local road repairs. Local fees of up to $40 per vehicle could be levied, but they'd have to be approved by voters.
\
Updating a 1951 law that governs state transportation revenue distribution, directing more of it to the upkeep of busy urban roads.
\
Holding down costs through expanded bidding procedures; public agencies and private firms would compete for road maintenance contracts.
\
Saving on administrative expenses by letting county governments dissolve county road commissions and assume direct responsibility of local roads.
\
Requiring employees of local road agencies to pay at least 20 percent of their health coverage costs and giving state government the authority to audit spending by the local agencies.
\
Many of Snyder's proposed strategies have been discussed for years, but haven't led to any action by elected officials. Switching from a flat tax to a proportional tax on gasoline, for example, was among suggestions in the 2009 report and was briefly advocated by ex-Gov. Jennifer Granholm, but opposed by fuel wholesalers and ignored by legislative leaders.
\
Wayne State University transportation expert John Taylor, who four years ago called for a 6-cent gas tax increase and 10-cent diesel tax hike, likes a lot of Snyder's proposals. He believes the wholesale fuel tax is a good idea because it would help state revenues keep pace with increasing prices of asphalt, concrete and steel used in road work.
\
Taylor authored a 2007 report for the Mackinac Center for Public Policy in which he noted that Michigan is falling behind other states that have more aggressive programs for improving and expanding their highway capacity, particularly in urban areas. He said fuel taxes here are ""quite low,"" compared with those of other states; the 19-cent gasoline tax ranked 31st, and the 15-cent diesel fuel tax was 45th in the country at the time his report was published.
\
The Citizens Research Council of Michigan says the state would have collected $12 billion more for road work had lawmakers opted for a switch to this type of a tax rather than a 4-cent increase in the flat tax on gasoline 14 years ago, owing to spiraling fuel prices. Researchers at the organization say future fuel prices appear more volatile, however, so having upper and lower limits as Snyder proposes makes sense.
\
Taylor also agrees with Snyder's proposed local-option registration fee proposal. Part of the reason other states have better roads, he said, is because their local governments are able to raise and spend more money on local roads.
\
Snyder's plan has gotten a mixed reaction from lawmakers. Still, he said he welcomes an exchange of views on road funding.
\
Senate Majority Leader Randy Richardville, R-Monroe, and Transportation Chairman Tom Casperson, R-Escanaba, acknowledged the need for better roads and pledged to work with the governor, but spoke cautiously of his ideas. Richardville said they'll ""begin much-needed discussion."" Casperson added that ""simply throwing more money at a problem isn't going to fix it.""
\
Senate Democratic Leader Gretchen Whitmer criticized the plan as ""regurgitated ideas that amount to little more than a shell game.""
\
State can't wait
\
Lawmakers, in fact, are skeptical that added road funding in the billion-dollar range can be approved. They are working on their own, more modest proposals.
\
Meanwhile, the time for sorting through the various options is running short.
\
Keith Ledbetter, legislative affairs director for the industry-based Michigan Infrastructure and Transportation Association, said solutions realistically should come in the remaining weeks of this year's legislative session. Approving more money for roads would be problematic in the politically charged environment of the 2012 presidential election season, he said.
\
""This is our chance,"" he said. ""We've got about two months to get something done. If nothing happens, we have no idea what to do (next).""
\
Knowing this, lawmakers must roll up their sleeves. A decade of reluctance to take on difficult solutions, which likely include use tax increases, has left Michigan with a growing inventory of crumbling roads.

As the Detroit Regional Chamber prepares for its annual conference on Mackinac Island, the Michigan Chronicle asked the leading candidates for governor what issues they feel are of primary importance to Southeastern Michigan, and how they would address them if elected.
\
Granholm: Focus on Detroit's image
\
Michigan Attorney General Jennifer Granholm believes the image of Detroit should be high on the list of regional issues discussed at the Detroit Regional Chamber Conference on Mackinac Island.
\
Granholm, 43, of Northville, and a Democratic candidate for governor, would also like to see more attention given to education, regional coordination and cooperation among entities regarding transportation policy, as well as infrastructure issues in general.
\
""With respect to assisting the mayor in making his plans a reality, he obviously wants and needs to have a vibrant economy in the city of Detroit,"" Granholm said. ""The Detroit Regional Chamber, as well as all other business groups, including the Tourism Council, all recognize that without a rising city of Detroit, the region suffers and the state suffers.""
\
Granholm added that if the state is focused on bringing back its census core communities, such as Detroit, Lansing and Saginaw, then it prioritize its infrastructure development and prioritize where it places businesses and where it incubates businesses.
\
She said Detroit cannot be cut out of Michigan any more than Chicago can be cut out of Illinois, or New York City out of New York.
\
""We all rise or fall on the image of our great cities, and we are the last urban center in the country to come back,"" she said. ""We are no longer a rust belt state. We are a high tech economy. We have to prepare a work force to take over the high tech jobs, which is why education has got to be at the very top of the list.""
\
A former Wayne County corporation counsel, prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney's office, and clerk for Court of Appeals Judge Damon Keith, Granholm is serving her first term as attorney general. She entered the gubernatorial race early last year, on a platform of ""raising the bar.""
\
""I think we expect too little of our government,"" she said at the time.
\
As governor, Granholm would like to see the Mackinac conference place an emphasis on work force development, regional skills alliances, and partnerships between private and public sectors.
\
She'd also like to see a high tech focus laid upon the automotive platform the state already has, and a great emphasis placed on the development of small businesses.
\
Blanchard: Work to improve the community
\
When Jim Blanchard announced his candidacy for governor last year, he emphasized the importance of Detroit's neighborhoods, saying it's one thing to have new stadiums, three casinos and occasional conventions at Cobo Center, but quite another to improve everyday life in the community.
\
To that end, Blanchard, 59, unveiled his urban agenda, the Michigan Community Partnership, at Focus: HOPE last month. He emphasized that the state must be a helpful partner to neighborhood, church and nonprofit groups that are working to improve the community.
\
Blanchard, a two-term governor (1983-1991), had previously been a U.S. congressman from 1975 to 1982. Since leaving office after his defeat by Gov. Engler, he has served as U.S. ambassador to Canada from 1993 to 1996, and has been a partner with a Washington-based law firm. He currently lives in Beverly Hills.
\
When he unveiled his partnership, Blanchard said there needs to be an open and honest dialogue on race relations. He believes encouraging this dialogue is a major step in rebuilding Michigan's cities.
\
""As a state, we have ignored this issue for far too long,"" he said. ""The strength of our state is our diversity. Starting with the governor, our public officials and media executives must lead on this important issue.""
\
Blanchard also believes neighborhood schools should be strengthened and that there should be more parental involvement in early childhood development.
\
Other issues Blanchard believes are important to the region are insurance redlining, transportation, neighborhood cleanup, the environment and seniors' security, housing and health.
\
Blanchard plans to be at the Mackinac conference part of the time. If he is governor next year, he said he would try to get more dialogue going at the conference on some of those other issues.
\
""One area that's been talked about at Mackinac generally, has been transportation,"" Blanchard said. ""We haven't really always dealt with these other issues, which I think are just as important.""
\
Blanchard also advocates a 50-point urban agenda which also includes implementing a service/learning high school graduation requirement, creating state parks within cities, and providing grants to successful community groups.
\
He also said the mayor would need a Democratic ally in dealing with Washington.
\
Posthumus: Rebuild Detroit neighborhoods
\
Dick Posthumus believes the number one issue for the region is the continuing rebuilding of Detroit, because in a global economy, people in other countries don't talk about doing business with Michigan; they talk about doing business with Detroit.
\
""Detroit is the image for the state, and I think it's very important that we all understand that, and that rebuilding the city is critical to all of us,"" he said.
\
Posthumus, 51, hopes to change his title from 1t. governor to governor next year. The Republican from Alto -- one of only two candidates who do not live in southeast Michigan -- is presumed by many to be his party's pre-determined nominee. However, fellow Republican Joe Schwarz of Battle Creek hopes to prove that prediction wrong, and secure the nomination for himself.
\
Posthumus said four things are critical to the success of a community: good schools, good jobs, a safe environment, and decent housing and good neighborhoods.
\
""One of my goals as governor will be the greening of Detroit,"" Posthumus said. ""That involves taking some 45,000 vacant pieces of property that are now in the city's or state's hand, and through an authority make them more accessible to individuals or nonprofits to help rebuild neighborhoods.""
\
He believes the single biggest challenge within the city itself is the rebuilding of the public school system. In the greater Detroit region, the biggest challenge is continued upgrading of the transportation system.
\
Another major goal of his administration will be to rebuild I-94 from the airport to downtown Detroit. Posthumus said many visitors to Detroit take I-94 into downtown, and that it should be in better condition than it is.
\
Prior to becoming 1t. governor, Posthumus served in the state Senate from 1983 to 1999. He also managed Engler's first political campaign in 1972. Engler campaigned for the state house at the time.
\
David Bonior: Cut back on suburban sprawl
\
If he becomes governor, Rep. David Bonior (D-Mt. Clemens), won't allow any changes to state law to give Wayne County the authority to run the proposed 1,800-acre Pinnacle development near Metro Airport.
\
Instead, he'd rather see a new development of that nature closer to Detroit.
\
Similarly, while Bonior agrees with Gov. Engler's plans to create an energy business park where businesses would focus on developing new sources of energy, such as fuel cells, he disagrees that it should be located in the country, 15 miles south of Ann Arbor.
\
""I want to move it in,"" Bonior said. ""I want to move that kind of development and the Pinnacle development in our cities, in Detroit, in Flint, in Saginaw.""
\
Bonior added that there are engineering and business schools in Detroit that could be utilized in moving such projects forward.
\
""It's already there,"" he said. ""We've got the infrastructure there. We have the need and the talent there to do this. So I want to move things in (toward the cities) and not out.""
\
Bonior, 56, has been a U.S. representative since 1977. Prior to that, he served in the state House for four years. Recently, he announced that state. Sen. Alma Wheeler Smith (D-Salem), a former rival for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, would be his running mate.
\
In addition to curbing suburban sprawl, Bonior believes roads in southeast Michigan need to be fixed and that a good public transportation system -- utilizing both buses and rail -- need to be developed.
\
""People spend, on an average, $200 a year in the Detroit area to fix their cars because of bad roads,"" he said.
\
Bonior is also concerned about insurance redlining, and will put an end to discriminatory insurance rates, especially for automobile insurance.
\
He said a person in Detroit can pay from $800 to $1500 more per year than a person in Ferndale of the same age, with the same driving record and same kind of car.
\
Bonior also advocates establishing neighborhood credit unions. He would seed these institutions with state dollars to help them get started.
\
""We need to partner with existing institutions within those neighborhoods,"" he said.
\
Bonior plans to attend the conference, and said that if he's governor next year, he would bring the issues of redlining and rebuilding cities to the table.
\
Joe Schwarz: Offers moderate Republicans an alternative
\
Joe Schwarz, 64, is the other Republican candidate for governor.
\
He hopes to convince Republicans to nominate him and not Lt. Gov. Dick Posthumus for governor at this summer's convention. He is promoting himself as a mainstream moderate conservative.
\
A practicing ear, nose and throat surgeon, Schwarz has been in the state Senate since 1989, and was mayor of Battle Creek from 1985 to 1987. In 2000, he chaired Sen. John McCain's presidential primary campaign in Michigan.
\
Schwarz's campaign focuses on five issues: the economy, education, health care, the environment and responsible government.
\
In terms of southeast Michigan, Schwarz believes the key issues are regional transit, the combined sanitary sewer overflow and water supply problem, education and roads.
\
""My guess, after looking at the Macomb County report, a report done by the Senate fiscal agency, and a report done by the Senate Science Office, we have to be looking at somewhere between $20 million and $50 billion over next 20 years to address the needs of simply putting storm sewers and sanitary sewers and the water supply situation in a condition where growth can continue,"" Schwarz said.
\
Schwarz added that the combined sanitary sewer overflow and water supply problem for the entire region is ""the time bomb waiting to go off.""
\
In terms of public education, he believes Detroit Schools CEO Ken Burnley is doing a fine job in trying to turn schools around. He acknowledged, however, that the project will take a long time.
\
""The proof of the pudding will be after the election of 2004, when I'm certain the public schools will be returned to a traditional elected board,"" he said, adding, ""we won't go back to the bad old ways in the Detroit school district.""
\
In terms of improving the roads, Schwarz says the questions to be addressed are not only what is the best strategy, but also how to best fund such a project?
\
""My personal feeling is that instead of thinking about building more freeways or widening existing freeways, we need to upgrade and improve existing roads,"" he said. ""Even though the state has spent about $1.5 billion per year for the last four years, we need to spend $1.5 billion per year for the next 10 years to get roads in the state -- and particularly in southeast Michigan, up to speed.""
\
He said some roads in Oakland County, which has more than 1 million people, are designed for a county with only 300,000 people.
\
We deferred too much road maintenance in the 70s 80s and early 90s, and now we're paying the piper.
\
Schwarz believes there will need to be some revenue enhancements, such as raising the diesel tax to 19 cents per gallon and/or an additional general increase in the gas tax of 5 cents to 8 cents per gallon, to fund road improvements.
\
He said federal and state dollars are going down because of lower tax revenues, and believes people would be willing to make that expenditure if they know the money would be going into the roads.
\
Schwarz has challenged Posthumus to a series of eight debates to discuss their views on Michigan's future.

"
164,"What are the greatest challenges faced by your constituents and what do you plan to do about it?\Andrea LaFontaine: The greatest challenge faced by residents in the 32nd District is jobs. While our current unemployment rate is 8.5%, compared with 14.2% in August 2009, there are still many people out of work and struggling to make ends meet. The repeal of the Michigan Business Tax in 2011 was a step in the right direction, however there is much more work to be done to truly make Michigan a place for job providers to locate. The repeal of the Personal Property Tax will provide much needed relief to businesses who are being punished for increased investment, and additional reforms to our regulatory structure will make the process of starting a business much easier.\Michael Schmina: The greatest challenges facing the people of the 32nd district are jobs and the stagnant economy. I believe that individuals and business--especially small, local businesses--are over-regulated and over-taxed by a state government that tries to do more than it can and should do; and therefore spends too much of our money. I will strive to create a better business environment by cutting the size and cost of the state government by eliminating redundancies in favor of local control.\Michigan's roads need fixing. How will we get the money to do it?\LaFontaine: Michigan's roads are in need of increased investment to maintain and improve their quality, however I do not support increasing revenues until we have ensured that our current revenues are being used properly. For instance, not all revenues from the gas tax go to roads and bridges, and other funds distributed by the state for road projects are sometimes squandered on administrative costs. Until we have maximized our current investment, I would not support increasing costs or fees on Michigan's hardworking taxpayers.\Schmina: Michigan's roads need fixing. We need to stop diverting transportation to non-road uses and push hard on the federal government to return all of the transportation dollars it raises here without an endless list of conditions. The main form of transportation in Michigan is on our roads, before Lansing asks for one additional dollar in taxes we need to start spending transportation dollars on the roads where it is most needed.\How would you assure local officials who face the loss of personal property tax revenue?\LaFontaine: I support the repeal of the personal property tax, however local units of government should not bear the full cost of the loss of revenue. I understand the importance of this issue and the revenue that local governments rely on, and acknowledge that a quick fix will not work. The legislature has so far proceeded with caution to ensure that the final product makes sense to all stakeholders. Local governments have faced very difficult decisions in recent years due to the decline in property tax revenue and cuts to state revenue sharing. The current proposal to repeal the personal property tax replaces that lost revenue with expiring tax credits, which provides assurances to local governments that Lansing will not continue its record of broken promises. That proposal also includes clauses that stipulate if replacement revenues are not provided, the personal property tax would be phased back in. Lawmakers have been, and continue to work with local governments on a solution that would preserve their revenues, while providing much needed relief to job providers.\Schmina: The PPT is a nightmare--whenever I try to explain it to people who have never paid it, they have a hard time understanding that such a thing exists and even many people in the local governments that rely on it admit that it is difficult and byzantine tax. It needs to be eliminated. In order to grow and flourish, Michigan needs a state government that spends less money, which will free up resources to for local communities without raising taxes.\What actions should be taken to increase job creation in the area?\LaFontaine: To increase job creation in the area, we can continue to promote the Blue Water area and the resources the area has for businesses. The area has tremendous existing infrastructure that make the region attractive to job providers, and we must continue to promote that. Our geographic location as well as the accessibility of the Blue Water Bridge provides many opportunities for businesses to expand to new markets. Additionally, continuing to decrease the regulatory burden that is placed on employers will make Michigan an overall better place for job providers to locate. Finally, Michigan is home to an extremely talented and well-educated workforce, however the changing economy has resulted in shifting needs for skilled workers. Increased access to job training and career technical education programs will provide opportunities for those seeking work to gain the skills needed to compete in the job market.\Schmina: Michigan's business environment is not friendly to small businesses and start-ups. Confusing and onerous taxes, regulations, and labor laws make it very difficult for individuals to follow their dreams and start their own businesses. In today's economy, we need to recognize that our small businesses are what keep our local communities working. The days of one industry providing middle-class jobs for recent high school graduates is long gone, and we should be poised to encourage economic growth by getting government out of the way and allow people to create their own jobs.\How will you make sure the Blue Water Area's voice is heard in Lansing?\LaFontaine: Since taking office, I have maintained a close relationship with community leaders and local elected officials to ensure the Blue Water Area is well represented in Lansing. I will continue to build upon these relationships and as a member on the House Local Government Committee has given me an opportunity to ensure the voices of our local governments are heard. Additionally, since taking office, I have held over 50 'office hours' and met with hundreds of local residents to hear their concerns, and I will continue to maintain close relations with the hardworking taxpayers in the Blue Water Area.\Schmina: I have been a tax paying homeowner in St. Clair County for 10 years. Two kids have graduated from local schools and a fourth is about to enter kindergarten. I am invested in my community, in the Blue Water Area and Anchor Bay, as well as all of the beautiful rural areas in between. I live here and love it here. I have many ties here, including the Immaculate Conception Church, the Pearl Beech Lions, and the St. Clair County Council on Aging. I have no desire to get away from that. As a long-time resident, the policies in Lansing affect my neighbors, my community, and my family. I have a vested interest in making the voices from the 32nd District heard in Lansing. As your state representative, I will continue to live here, listen to my community and share our concerns with the lawmakers in our capitol. While I will work in Lansing, I will not live there. I will not become a part of the pampered ruling class.\At a glance\Andrea LaFontaine (R)\Age: 25\Address: 10317 Big Hand Road, Columbus\Occupation: State representative\Political experience: Serving first term as state representative\Family: Father, Chuck LaFontaine; mother, Cathy LaFontaine; brother, Chuck LaFontaine\Michael Shmina (R)\Age: 45\Address: 7911 Bouvier Bay Road, Fair Haven\Occupation: Project Manager for A.Z.

165,"Dan Gilbert, the billionaire developer who has helped transform downtown Detroit, was supposed to be one of the first speakers Wednesday at the 39th annual Mackinac Policy Conference.\But the three-day conference on Mackinac Island, which is put on by the Detroit Regional Chamber, had an unexpected schedule change Sunday when Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans and owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team, was hospitalized with stroke-like symptoms.\""First, the most important thing is Dan's health. Dan and his family are in our thoughts and we are wishing him a speedy recovery,"" said Sandy Baruah, the chamber's president and CEO. ""The Chamber is grateful that Dan's colleague, Bill Emerson, (vice chairman of Quicken Loans) will be taking his place on stage at the Conference.""\Gilbert's center stage time at noon Wednesday would have been his second speaking appearance on the island. His first was in 2016 when he spoke about his commitment to and hopes for the city where he, his father and grandfather were born.\While Gilbert won't be on the island for the conference, 1,700 of Michigan's top business and political leaders will board ferries Tuesday for the ride to the island for three days of discussions on state and national policy, liberally mixed with parties, cocktails and bountiful platters of assorted crudites and canapes.\For 38 years, the annual Detroit Regional Chamber's Mackinac Policy Conference has become a mix of high-level ideals on the main conference stage and more subtle negotiations on the Grand Hotel's sprawling porch, where business deals get done and political alliances are either brokered or broken.\Consider Detroit's ""grand bargain,"" the 2014 plan that kept Detroit from heading into insolvency. Some of the components of that plan came together on the island. And while former Gov. John Engler dashed hopes with his veto pen on his last day in office in 2002 for a true regional transit plan for Detroit and its suburbs, the beginning of what is now the Regional Transit Authority started in the island in 2001.\The 39th annual version of the conference is sure to be a networking bonanza for all attending. And while acknowledging that both Michigan and the nation are operating under divided and often contentious branches of government, conference organizers believe there are ways to bridge that divide.\""We wanted the umbrella over the conference to be One Michigan,"" said Patti Poppe, CEO of CMS Energy and this year's chairwoman of the conference. ""We're not competing with ourselves, we're competing with the globe.""\Here's what to expect from this year's Mackinac Policy Conference:\The conference officially has a theme that revolves around three pillars:\Prepare Michigan for the challenges of improving educational outcomes for both K-12 and college students while still focusing on training the workforce for the jobs that are available now and retraining workers in jobs that are becoming obsolete. There could be talk on the contentious issue of consolidating some of the 900 school districts in the state as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush addresses the crowd about how that was accomplished in Florida.\Bush was a passionate advocate for school choice, including charter schools, during his tenure as governor. That issue has divided the education community, between teachers who feel increased choice has diverted money away from many school districts, especially in urban areas and choice advocates who believe parents should have every option available for their children. The conference also will take on the subject of free tuition for community colleges, which has become a popular theme on the presidential campaign trail.\Grow Michigan or the spirit of entrepreneurship that thrives in Michigan as evidenced by Ari Weinzweig, co-founder of the Ann Arbor-based Zingerman's Delicatessen, who will talk about the journey from a small deli to a major restaurant, bakery and mail-order business that now has 500 employees.\The conference also will look at the upcoming 2020 Census and how important it is for Michigan in terms of congressional representation and federal funding allocation. Michigan's philanthropic community will join civic and business leaders to make sure that the Census in Michigan is a success and every citizen is counted.\Love Michigan or how businesses in the state are building sustainable models of energy and production to provide stewardship for the state's environment. The pillar, however, is more than just about the physical environment. It's also about the more spiritual psyche of the state and how Michiganders can be more civil to each other during contentious political times.\Sessions will include several on reaching across the political aisle to accomplish public policy and some time to remember the legacy of business leaders who died in the last year, including Richard DeVos, co-founder of Amway and owner of the Orlando Magic basketball team; Art VanElslander, who found the Art Van Furniture store, and John Barfield, a longtime entrepreneur, whose last company was the Bartech Group, a Southfield-based workforce management and consulting firm.\With Republicans holding a majority in both the state House and Senate, and Democrats holding the offices of governor, attorney general and secretary of state, friction has already been standard operating procedure in Lansing. But all the leading players will be on the island with one of the key components of the conference being working across the aisle to get substantial policy passed.\So does that mean that a deal to ""fix the damn roads,"" reform Michigan's highest-in-the nation auto insurance costs and inking a budget deal will happen on the island?\The auto insurance deal got done Friday and could be signed by Whitmer on the island. It will definitely be held out as a historic accomplishment 40 years in the making and proof that bipartisanship can survive in Michigan, even if it is elusive in Washington D.C.\On roads and the budget, the gaps are still fairly wide between the Legislature and Whitmer. She included a 47-cent gas tax hike in her 2019-20 budget proposal and Republicans have said that's a nonstarter. On the budget, Republicans have proposed significant cuts in the budgets for Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Attorney General Dana Nessel, both Democrats who turned the two statewide seats blue after many years of GOP control.\Michigan's congressional delegation, however, will make a concerted effort to present a united front with both Republican and Democratic members scheduled to jointly appear at receptions, news conferences about shared goals and discussions on bringing civility back to politics.\The upcoming presidential election cycle will be front and center with appearances by well-known national political pundits Matthew Dowd and Donna Brazille, as well as Stacey Abrams, the rising Democratic star and 2018 candidate for governor in Georgia who narrowly lost the race. She has become a potent voice on the need to ensure voting rights for all and has been mentioned as a potential presidential candidate or running mate for the eventual Democratic nominee.\Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who also is appearing, was the last Republican presidential candidate standing before Donald Trump secured the GOP nomination in 2016. He has been a vocal critic of Trump since the 2016 election and hasn't ruled out another run in 2020.\Both are expected to address the political fractures that are currently roiling the country.\You can't ignore a Detroit focus from Mayor Mike Duggan, who, in past years, has been one of the most compelling speakers at the conference. In 2017, he laid out a plan to reverse years of urban planning disasters that caused the decline of the city over the past 50 years.\In addition to Duggan's keynote speech on Thursday, a data mapping project at Wayne State University that will gather and disseminate data on underserved populations in order to better target health initiatives will be explored.\And while Gilbert's appearance on the Mackinac stage was canceled, his first appearance during the conference in 2016 was one of the highlights.\""Let's come downtown and not only hopefully do well there but maybe make a difference,"" he said of his decision to locate his company's headquarters in Detroit rather than in the suburbs. ""We wanted to lead from the heart and the brain, not just the brain.""\The decision paid off, he said in 2016, because now more and more young people are deciding to make the move to Detroit.\""There's nobody who gets here who isn't sort of seduced by Detroit. And that's whether they come here from Harvard or Yale or UCLA or Iowa or Michigan or MSU,"" Gilbert said. ""You go to some of these other big cities and you'll do well ... but what you can't do over there is impact the community or the city from day one and that becomes a big selling point here.""\In addition to parties on the porch, tents on the hotel's lawn and inside restaurants, bars and suites at the Grand Hotel, businesses, lobbying firms and special interest groups will be hosting parties at establishments across the island. Not to miss: Horn's, the Pink Pony, the Mustang Lounge for maximum shoulder-to-shoulder packed late-night revelry.\If you're registered for the conference, bring an umbrella and jacket. Rain is in the forecast all three days of the conference and the highs are predicted in the mid-50s. There is nothing worse than having to trudge up the steep hill to the Grand Hotel in a downpour when horse-drawn carriages are scarce.\Contact Kathleen Gray: 313-223-4430, kgray99@freepress.com or on Twitter @michpoligal.\The Grand Hotel's sprawling porch can be a place where political alliances are brokered\or broken.\Kathleen Gray/Detroit Free Press\CREDIT: Kathleen Gray"
166,"This is the first of an occasional series looking at our vanishing green space\and the issues that arise with growth, such as traffic congestion and lake\pollution.\It's 6:40 a.m. on a Thursday, and a stream of headlights marches south on\Lapeer Road in northern Oakland County. They're heading to plants, offices and\retail centers from Pontiac to downtown Detroit.\The endless, winding snake moves toward I-75, another sign of the urban growth\and sprawl that have started to alarm some residents and planners -- and even\developers.\When the four-lane Lapeer Road was completed in the 1950s, it rolled through a\rural expanse of fields, woods and wetlands. Now the road strains to serve\bustling northern Oakland County townships whose populations have jumped\nearly 40 percent since 1990.\Call it sprawl or unmanaged growth, it has become one of the nation's hottest\social, political and economic issues. Vice President Al Gore, who will make\urban growth a central theme in his 2000 presidential campaign, is expected to\bring the spotlight to Detroit at the National Town Meeting for Sustainable\Development at Cobo Hall May 2-5.\The urban area's push outward won't stop, posing big challenges in the next\century: How to balance transportation and housing needs with environmental\quality; how to provide basic services such as sewer and water; how to attract\people back to the older cities, and how to preserve the rustic quality in the\outer suburbs that helped draw people there.\The growth in southeast Michigan is eye-popping to outer suburban residents\who like a rural flavor.\""I know I'm going to lose it,"" said Deanna Burns, 35, of Addison Township, who\lives on Rochester Road. In the last five years, southbound traffic in the\morning has become unrelenting, said Burns, who works in Oxford and is\thinking about moving north. Getting out of her driveway takes up to five\minutes.\The Southeast Michigan Council of Governments estimates that, in the next 25\years, southeast Michigan's population will grow by 15 percent -- but that\extra 15 percent will consume at least 33 percent more land. Two-thirds of the\region's growth will take place in 32 communities in the outer suburbs,\converting 250,000 acres from rural to suburban uses.\The same process occurred 30 years ago closer to the urban core.\""I grew up in the farmlands of the north end of Troy,"" said Dan Roe, 45, of\Leonard. ""We lived on Coolidge, and it was gravel.""\Michigan is losing more than 100 acres of farmland a day. In Washtenaw County,\development -- mostly residential -- gobbles up about 3,200 acres of farmland\a year, said Douglas Woolley, supervisor of Pittsfield Township. Still,\there's little consensus about what, if anything, to do about it. Last year, a\land preservation initiative in the county that would have raised $32 million\in taxes over 10 years to pay some farmers not to sell or develop their land\lost, 52,501 to 38,724.\Chasing American Dream\To some, the urban area's steady push outward is simply part of chasing the\American Dream. But planners say that, without direction, the growth could\lead to added congestion, destroyed natural beauty and strained budgets for\roads, schools, and water and sewer services. Meanwhile, investments in older\cities such as Detroit could go unused if unplanned.\""There's no logic to that, except that if families want to raise their kids in\a rural area, where they can see deer once in a while, that's part of the\American Dream,"" said SEMCOG spokesman Donn Shelton. ""But if we aggregate all\those American dreams, it can become a nightmare.""\Take roads, for example. Even with a new gas-tax increase and more federal\aid, SEMCOG projects $13 billion in unmet road needs in the next 20 years.\Even with better roads, traffic congestion will worsen.\""The traffic is twice what it was 10 years ago,"" said John Kaminski, 38, of\Richmond in northern Macomb County. ""I used to be the only person on the road.\Now it's bumper-to-bumper. You drive along 94 and they've put up a subdivision\in every farm field.""\Oregon was ahead\Southeast Michigan has come late to the issue of urban sprawl. The regional\government in Portland, Ore., rimmed a green belt around the city 20 years\ago, banning development in that area. At a time when local land use controls\were minimal, the idea was almost revolutionary.\""Sustainable development is really in the middle,"" said Amy Malmer of SEMCOG.\""It says that economic progress doesn't have to deny environmental protection,\and environmental protection doesn't have to jeopardize progress.""\Among other things, sustainable development seeks to control urban sprawl by\preserving open space in the suburbs and redeveloping older cities, so that\more people will stay in or return to the urban core.\Detroit has been recognized and studied by the Environmental Protection Agency\for its redevelopment of brownfields -- old, abandoned industrial sites that\create blight.\Michigan's progress\Among examples of sustainable development in southeast Michigan:\In Hamburg Township in Livingston County, an open space ordinance adopted in\1992 allows builders to develop smaller lots -- a quarter acre instead of the\usual 1-acre minimum -- if they set aside at least 40 percent of the\subdivision for woodlands and other open space. Since 1992, 35 of 37\developers have chosen to build under the open space ordinance, said Zoning\Administrator Leslie Meyers. The program has preserved more than 1,060 acres\of open space.\In Highland Park, RIMCO Financial Corp. is rebuilding 200 abandoned homes that\it bought from the city, and selling them for $59,000 to $110,000. So far,\about 100 homes are rebuilt and 40 sold. Most of the houses have been vacant\for 10 to 15 years, said Mayor Linsey Porter.\Canton Township created a special district last year to govern the development\of the area around Lotz Road at Ford. The area had eight commercial,\industrial and residential zoning districts -- a recipe for hodgepodge\development, traffic congestion and destruction of open space. Now the\district will keep 25 percent of the land in open space and limit access to\Ford Road to ease traffic flow, said Community Planner Jeff Goulet.\In West Bloomfield Township, a wetlands ordinance enables a seven-person\review board to preserve wetlands smaller than the 5-acre minimum required for\state regulation. The ordinance gives many residents of subdivisions small\wetlands and ponds with ducks.\While preserving open space, developers like Gary Shapiro of Ivanhoe/Huntley\in West Bloomfield Township will push communities for higher-density\subdivisions.

167,"City candidates suggest possible revival of curbside service\Some of the Battle Creek City Commission candidates in recent weeks have touched on the possibility of reinstating curbside leaf pickup as part of their campaigns.\City officials have laid out the reasons the service was cut in 2000, and they say while service restoration ultimately is a policy decision for commissioners, the cost for the city to pick up loose leaves raked to the curb might be prohibitive.\In June 2000, city commissioners voted to end the popular curbside service, a move which saved an estimated $100,000 in a tight budget.\To restore it seven years later would cost about $170,000, according to Chris Dopp, city engineer, and that's with current staff and equipment.\Dopp said staff would have to be shifted to accomplish leaf pickup and the money would have to come from the city's general fund, which would mean taking money from other city services or programs.\The city isn't able to spend state-shared revenue or Act 51 gas tax revenues on leaf pickup, Dopp said.\According to city finance officials, more than 62 percent of the city's $46.5 million general fund in 2006-07 covered personnel costs, leaving $17,373,138 for programs and services.\""When you're talking about everything else we're doing -- and there's a lot of fixed costs -- when you're down to the discretionary component, you're talking a lot smaller piece of the pie,"" said city Finance Director Jim Ritsema.\Ken Kohs, Battle Creek environmental services director, said residents currently have leaf pickup from Waste Management, with whom the city contracts for solid waste and recycling curbside pickup. However, that service requires residents to put their leaves into bags and set them at the curb on trash day.\Officials said the city paid $43,988 to Waste Management in 2006-07 for fall leaf pickup, and $47,530 likely will be paid for this fiscal year.\Dopp said if reinstated, the city leaf pickup service likely wouldn't be available to all city residents.\""Because of the way the equipment operates, without curb and gutter, it's kind of hard to use the loader without tearing up lawns pretty bad,"" he said.\For homes without a curb and gutter, residents would have to rely on the Waste Management service, Dopp said, but it isn't clear if that contract still would be covered by the city if the curbside service is reinstated.\Beyond the dollars and cents of the debate, Kohs said leaves have an impact on the city's environment.\As leaves fall, they collect on storm drain grates, Kohs said, which can lead to localized flooding.\""Not to say we didn't have problems before,"" he said. ""But we're certain it's gotten worse since there hasn't been leaf pickup.""\The city employs one person seven months each year to clean drain inlets, Kohs said, as well as vacuum trucks to keep drains clear of leaves.\""If we don't keep the leaves out, they could degrade and increase the nutrient level in the rivers, nutrients like phosphorus,"" he said. ""That's the nutrient that the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality has targeted as a nutrient they want to minimize going into the waterways.""\In September, the City Commission adopted an ordinance banning the use of fertilizers containing phosphorus in an effort to reduce the amount of phosphorus draining into the local watershed.\Because there is other material with the leaves collected from storm drains, Kohs said, it's taken to the waste water treatment plant for cleaning and separating. The solids are taken to a landfill and the liquid goes into the waste water treatment plant and is treated with other sewage.\Some small amounts of leaves are turned into mulch, Kohs said.\Nick Schirripa can be reached at 966-0692 or nschirrip@battlecr.gannett.com.\Where they stand\on leaf pickup\In advance of the Nov. 6 city commission election, candidates for all nine seats were asked for their views on the possibility of city-funded curbside leaf pickup.\Do you favor reinstating leaf pickup in Battle Creek? If reinstated, where do you see the money coming from to pay for it?\Ward 1\Chris Simmons: Yes.\""I really don't think it should cost $170,000. We have plenty of city staff and equipment capable of achieving the task during their regular course of business. If there are additional costs for overtime or fuel, I would suggest we look at redirecting some of the departmental contingency funds.\""If we are really serious about reducing the amount of phosphorus in our rivers and lakes... then we should try to reduce the amount of organic matter that runs off.""\Bob Sutherby: Yes.\""I do not support simply taking away the money from savings but rather some meaningful cut showing fiscal responsibility.\""Currently, the city employs one person seven months of the year to do nothing but clear leaves from drains. That said, obviously we would recapture that savings by having the service restored acting as its own maintenance system. On top of recapturing the seven months of city employee time performing that function.""\Jarrite Jackson: Yes.\""When companies look for places to build their business, they look at cleanliness, maintenance and safety. If these things are lacking, it makes companies skeptical about opening a business.\""With all the tax breaks we give companies, we should want to invest in our city and neighborhoods as a whole. We would need to look at other expenditures where we are not using money wisely and take it from there. Taxpayers should not be charged for it.""\Ward 2\Tony Walker: No response.\Ward 3\Ken Bening-haus: Yes.\""I would have some questions about it, like how much of the $170,000 amount would be for wages and fringes that are already budgeted to be paid and the monies are there and could just be transferred?\""Also, where could state revenue funds be used to free up city tax dollars to pay for this?\""Till these questions are answered, I would think that at least for the first year the funds could be found either from the Revenue Control Budget money from the Public Service department or rainy day fund till the next budget year when the money could then be part of the normal budget process.""\Bob Bennett: No response.\John Cash: Yes.\""It's just another service that the people pay for with their tax dollars that they're not receiving.\""We the people expect basic services for our tax dollars. As a commissioner, I would want to find out where those monies went and if possible get that money back where it came from.""\Amy Hinton: Undecided.\""I would not feel comfortable saying yes to leaf pickup unless I knew what this would affect and would take away from the city's tax revenue.""\Patrick O'Donnell: Yes\""To pay for this, the city commission before had a plan to bring leaf pickup back before, but it was voted down. I would like to look at that plan again to see if it would work now. Also, we would save money by not having to send out city workers as much to fix flooding problems due to leaves in sewers. With that savings and get some good competitive bids, I believe we could bring leaf pickup back to the city.""\Sherry Sofia: Undecided.\""As I have campaigned this fall, the issues that people are discussing include jobs and the economy, code enforcement, crime and prostitution. I have yet to have anyone mention leaf pickup. Diversion of limited revenues to fund a service that is not available to all city residents at the expense of established priorities seems ill-advised at this time. I am willing to look at this proposal, however, if someone has a way to fund it that would not jeopardize other important services.""\Ward 4\Elizabeth Fulton: No response.\John Godfrey: No.\""Where does that money come from? It is a nice service, but not a required service such as roads, water, police and fire. As a private, small business owner, I note the number of small businesses that have sprung up in Battle Creek to accommodate the needs of citizens for the removal of leaves. If reinstated, is government then competing with private business? Some people have been critical of the city for the method in which it picked up leaves and have suggested the purchase of new and improved equipment. Where does that money come from?""\Ward 5\David A. Walters: No.\""If we as a city could accomplish leaf pickup without raising the tax, or the cutting of other services, I would love to see it reinstated. However, since I am not sure of other funding options at this time, I would not see this happening.""\Andy Yankama: No response.\At-large\Susan Baldwin: Undecided.\""As much as some folks would love a simple yes or no answer, it's not that easy. I would need more information about the true costs of leaf pickup before making a decision on whether to re-institute it.\""$170,000 is a lot of money. We must be vigilant over every additional cost. I would not raise taxes to cover this expense.""\Mark A. Behnke: Yes.\""I would like to see us put out a (request for proposals) to have leaf pickup in each of the wards, so that we would be able to find out the competitive cost for each ward. We could also allow the city workers to bid on the opportunity, just so that we can see how competitive they will be for this service.\""The funding for this project could possibly come out of the Revenue Control Budget and the moneys saved in these respective accounts. I see no reason why we can't get this job done for $20,000 in each ward and have the work completed by Thanksgiving.""\Beverli Carpenter-Hunter: Yes.\""It would be wise to do so because it's what the majority of what the people want and because it seems the drains aren't kept clean enough, at least on my street or neighborhood.\""In all fairness, I would have to see a budget in order to know where to trim the fat if necessary.""\Ryan Hersha: Yes.\""However, before I signed on to any plan, I would need to see how the operation would be deployed and at what actual cost to taxpayers. I would not support outsourcing this work, as Commissioner Behnke advocates.\""If we are serious about saving our city's great, historical neighborhoods, then we should not be making it more difficult to live in them. All in all, a properly administered leaf pick-up program could represent a sensible long-term investment in our city's neighborhoods, infrastructure and environment.""\Bill Morris: Yes.\""As we work to effectively market our community to job providers and homebuyers, we must be mindful of the role community aesthetics play in the overall perception of our city.\""I favor a competitive bid process to determine the real cost of the program. We also need to explore shared resource options and opportunities with surrounding municipalities as a way of reducing the cost of leaf pickup and disposal. Finally, if we have to sharpen our pencils a little as a last resort, I believe it's doable without massive cuts.""\Diane Thompson: Yes.\""I too would like to see a (request for proposals) for leaf pickup in each of the wards. It is time to assess whether or not the city gained any value by discontinuing this service, especially taking into account the fact that leaves make our neighborhoods look less than aesthetically pleasing, clog the sewer system and prevent snow and rain water from properly draining. An assessment should also include the cost incurred by the city for additional maintenance required to clean sewer systems."""
168,"THE QUESTIONS\1. Should the property tax limits in Proposal A be amended to allow local\school districts to seek additional millage for operations?\2. Identify one currently funded state program that should be scaled back or\eliminated.\3. Would you support higher taxes and/or a significant state subsidy to launch\an aggressive new regional public transit system? If yes, what type of tax?\1st District\Edward J. Gaffney\Party: Republican\Age: 58\Residence: Grosse Pointe Farms\Background: Mayor, Grosse Pointe Farms, 1999-present; GP Farms City Council,\1991-1999; former regional government affairs director, American Automobile\Manufacturers Association; legal counsel and researcher, Legislative Service\Bureau; director, Michigan Center for Truck Safety; member, state Community\Corrections Commission.\Education: BA, Eastern Connecticut State University; MA, Michigan State\University; JD, Thomas M. Cooley Law School; Master of Laws, Wayne State\University.\Personal: Married, three children\Questions:\1. No. There is no demonstrated need for such a change at this time. If and\when school districts need more funding for operations, then they should first\seek legislation which would allow the formation of charitable organizations\which would accept voluntary contributions from individuals and corporations\for school funding. In turn, contributors would be allowed a tax credit (e.g.,\up to $500) on their state income tax.\2. As mayor of Grosse Pointe Farms, I do not know of one program that should\be cut out completely. A better approach might be to scale back. Require all\state agencies to cut their budgets in the overhead and administration area by\10 percent. Thus, the burden falls equally on all agencies.\3. There is no doubt that a regional transit system should be the ultimate\goal for metro Detroit. People need to get to where the jobs are, and seniors\need to go shopping and to health care providers. The problem is how to pay\for it. As in other metropolitan areas, the federal government may be in a\better position to fund such a program.\David Putrycus\Party: Democrat\Age: 40\Residence: Grosse Pointe Woods\Background: Lawyer Education: BA, University of Michigan; JD, Detroit College\of Law\Personal: Engaged\Questions:\1. It was a well-thought-out proposal when it passed in 1994. We shouldn't\mess with it. When they say ""tweak,"" that scares the heck out of me. That\means taxes are going up.\2. Dumping money in road repair and construction. What we're doing is not\working. Roads are a travesty. I don't believe the whole road program should\be scrapped because I don't think there is a road program. It should be\completely and totally redone.\3. I am a committed advocate to a comprehensive, regional mass transit system.\It's something that needs to be explored and implemented. Something this\comprehensive will have tremendous start-up costs. A base of revenue could\come from users. We're woefully behind other cities.

Artina Tinsley Hardman; special education teacher,\Highland Park Schools\Education: BA, Morehouse College; JD, Case Western Reserve School of Law\Personal: Single\Questions:\1. No. Proposal A was enacted to lower property taxes, limit the number of\school millage elections and narrow funding disparity between pupils in rich\and poor districts. Because Michigan has reduced reliance on local property\taxes, our educational system no longer perpetuates the fact that poor\districts will have fewer resources with which to educate their students.\2. I have always strived to first take a look at the way government is being\run and make sure it's being run as efficiently as possible so that every tax\dollar it currently takes in is being maximized. That's why I stand behind the\Democratic proposal to eliminate over $100 million in administrative expenses.\3. Yes. The lack of effective public transportation in metro Detroit hinders\economic progress in the region. Improved transit service would better allow\workers to get to their jobs, benefiting both workers and employers, ease\growing traffic congestion, reduce air pollution and improve our quality of\life as people would have an alternative to sitting in traffic.\6th District\Dorothy Patterson\Did not respond to questionnaire\Party: Republican\Residence: Detroit\Marsha Cheeks\Party: Democrat\Age: 46\Residence: Detroit\Background: Director, Science, Mathematics, Aerospace Academy at Wayne State\University; 24-year teacher, Detroit Public Schools.\Education: Graduate, Central Michigan University\Personal: Three children\Questions:\1. No. The tax limits in Proposal A should not be amended. School districts\should not be able to access state funds locally, because student enrollment\is not open statewide. This policy would put those school districts already\lacking at a further disadvantage.\2. I would like to look to scale back the Highway Trust Fund. This would be a\way of preserving Michigan farmland, controlling urban sprawl.\3.

No. Being retired, I feel that the property taxes could escalate like they\did before Proposal A, making it difficult for retirees and people on fixed\incomes.\2. The state bought a laptop for every teacher. That had to be expensive. I\don't know how that was monitored. There's a lot of room for waste.\3. Yes.

Yes, because I believe it should be left to citizens of individual taxing\jurisdictions to decide whether or not they want to invest additional tax\dollars into their public school system.\2. (No answer given.)\3. I would increase the diesel tax. Currently there is no parity between what\truck drivers pay and car drivers pay for gasoline. A portion of the revenue\from the diesel tax should be used to fund a regional transportation system.\10th District\John T. Nazars\Party: Republican\Age: 21\Residence: Detroit\Background: Security guard\Education: GED, computer vocational schools\Questions:\1. Yes.\2. I cannot think of any. Gov. Engler has already eliminated and reduced a lot\of them.\3. Yes, I would seek a tax. The best idea is to place the tax on new vehicle\sales. Michigan could raise as much as $50 million a year, at 1 million car\sales a year. Even if Michigan citizens only bought 100,000 cars a year, that\would generate $5 million a year for a mass public transit system.\Triette Lipsey Reeves\Did not respond to questionnaire\Party: Democrat\Age: 38\Residence: Detroit\Background: Serving second term (partial term in 1992) in state House of\Representatives\Education: BA, Michigan State University\Alan Jacobson\Party: Green\Age: 37\Residence: Detroit Background: Secretary, office manager, bookkeeper;\political organizer since age 18; military service (U.S. Army); course work in\parliamentary procedure.\Education: Student, Wayne State University.\Personal: Married\Questions:\1. Inequity in school funding is a major problem. Rather than allow individual\districts to add millage, I would support removing the tax exemption in\renaissance zones for school-related taxes only; $145 million has been lost to\the schools since 1994 because of development-related exemptions and\deferrals.\2. The Michigan Economic Growth Authority has been expanded far beyond its\initial mandate. In addition, MEGA's definition of job creation has been\relaxed, reducing the employment impact of this tax abatement program. This\program has been costly in lost tax revenues with a limited amount of net job\growth.\3. Substantial federal monies have gone to other metro areas because of\legislative gridlock. A relatively small sum financed locally is needed to\obtain these federal funds, easily raised through a minor surcharge on fuel.\11th District\Charles E.

Yes, but mechanisms need to be developed to ensure equity between\low-income and upper-income districts. Having local residents vote to increase\their taxes to fund education seems democratic and valuable to our system of\education, but we cannot allow those local taxes to come at the cost of\inadequate state per-pupil reimbursements to poor districts, which rely on\these funds.\2. Prison budget. We should reform mandatory minimums and parole systems for\nonviolent offenders. Investment in treatment, education, job training, mental\health services and youth recreation can curb long-term criminal justice needs\and costs.\3. Yes. I would consider a number of options, including a gas tax, impact fees\on new residential developments in ""greenfield"" areas, employment/wage taxes\and other options necessary to create local and state matches to increased\federal funds.\13th District\Darrell Stasik\Party: Republican\Age: 60\Residence: Riverview\Background: Program analyst Education: BS, Pennsylvania State University; MBA,\University of Pittsburgh\Personal: Married, one child\Questions:\1. No tweaking of Proposal A. It should be paid by the state because of the\changes in the law. If funding is needed, there are different ways of getting\the funds.\2. I wouldn't have any idea about that.\3. No. The problem is high medical costs and how to get the costs down to\where businesses can afford them. Higher taxes are not the way. I am for free\enterprise and lowering taxes.\Barbara A. Farrah\Party: Democrat\Age: 36\Residence: Southgate\Background: Southgate City Council, 1991-present (two terms as council\president); past chair of Southgate Planning Commission; vice-chair, Southgate\TIFA Board; community relations, Wayne County Department of Environment.\Education: BA, University of Michigan-Dearborn, 1989\Personal: Single\Questions:\1. Proposal A has narrowed the spending gap overall, but it has not solved\other inequities in our school funding system. I don't believe that we should\go back to a property tax-based system to fund our schools, however. We need\to come together and develop a plan that provides adequate funding no matter\what the level of state revenues is.\2. We are going to have to go in and make cuts across the board. We are going\to have to look at all government and see where cuts can be made, where\consolidation could happen and realign our staff to be as efficient and\effective as possible. I believe that we need to take a look at all our\programs and evaluate their budgets and effectiveness.\3. A public transit system is vital to our growth, stability and ability to\compete. We need to go to Washington and bring back a greater share of the\federal transit dollars. The state has to act as the leader in this effort,\which will help to stop urban sprawl, promote the rebuilding of our urban\areas, save our green space and increase prosperity for the entire region and\state.\Eric Gordon\Party: Libertarian\Age: 32\Residence: Wyandotte\Background: Finance analyst\Education: BA, Western Michigan University\Personal: Married, two children\Questions:\1. No.\2. This month, the 15 appointed members of the Michigan Council for Arts and\Cultural Affairs announced they had approved 368 applications totaling\$22,600,000 in grants, or an average of $61,413.04 per grant. In short, the\people of Michigan were told that 368 grant applicants, people the taxpayers\probably don't know and will never meet, can spend their $61,413.04 better\than the people who earned the money in the first place.\3. No. If the citizens of Michigan really wanted a new regional public transit\system, then some clever entrepreneur would figure out a way to satisfy their\need. The simple fact that the state has to step in and financially prop up\this dream, on the backs of taxpayers, most of whom, no doubt, are quite happy\with the freedom of their automobiles, says that this is a waste of money.\14th District\Chris O'Loughlin\Did not respond to questionnaire\Party: Republican\Residence: Melvindale\William J.

One in particular we ought to look at is putting back the DEQ and DNR into\one department, the way it once was.\3. I'm not in favor of any new taxes until we straighten our budget out. I'm\in favor of a regional transit system but I'm greatly concerned how we're\going to pay for it without having to go back to the public and increase\taxes.

Proposal A should not be amended to allow school districts to seek\additional millages for operations. The funding gap would increase if\districts were allowed to raise supplemental millages.\2. During this economic downturn, we need to look at the spending of all\programs and cut wasteful spending across the board.\3. Under the current budget situation, I feel it would be hard for the state\to subsidize any new programs without drastically hurting other existing\programs. The question of who will operate such a system must be decided\before I could support any form of tax increase.\Daniel Paletko\Party: Democrat\Age: 51\Residence: Dearborn Heights.\Background: Accountant; retired Ford Motor Co. financial manager; 28-year\member, Dearborn Heights City Council.\Education: BBA, University of Michigan-Dearborn; MBA, University of\Detroit-Mercy; MST, Wayne State University\Personal: Married, two children\Questions:\1. Not at this time. The disparities in per-pupil funding, however, need to be\addressed. The Legislature must also adjust the funding formulas to take into\ac1count those districts with declining enrollment and those with increasing\enrollment. I believe an equitable solution can be found.\2. The ""privatization pilot program"" cost taxpayers double for a private\company to do road-paving work that could have been done by MDOT employees;\325,000 to instill the ""Amway culture"" in 270 employees; $370,000 to Meijer's\to teach store managers public speaking and computer skills; $1.1 million to\GM to teach ""group dynamics."" There are many more.\3.The 2000 census indicates fewer people in Michigan are using public transit\and carpooling. While I believe metro Detroit cannot reach its full potential\without an effective, efficient mass transit system, a consensus must first be\formed to accept the heavy investment it will require. Until then, the type of\tax is irrelevant.\Christopher Gonzalez\Party: Libertarian\Age: 48\Residence: Dearborn Heights\Background: Industrial electrician\Education: BS, Michigan State University\Personal: Single\Questions:\1. No. We do not need any more taxes. We need to eliminate waste and\corruption. We need to increase parental choice in the education of their\children.\2. All funding for arts programs. The peoples' taxes should not be used for\some person's hobbies and diversions.\3. No. Take the current funding and subsidize a private bus company.

I do not support changing Proposal A to allow this. One of the reasons\school districts continue to have difficulty is that the Engler administration\has cut categorical grants as well as not adequately providing for special\education.\2. Without touching a state program, we should look at the number of\administrative positions within the governor's office as well as across the\board in state government. Bringing DEQ and DNR back into the same department\would produce savings as well. Some exorbitant salaries should also be\reviewed for reduction, such as the CEO of the Michigan Economic Development\Corp.\3. While I support the improvement of public transit and realize its role in\our economy, I would not support increasing taxes at this time. The Engler\administration and the current leadership have continued to raid the state\transportation fund to inappropriately fund the Office of the Secretary of\State and the Treasury Department. If transportation-related taxes were spent\appropriately, I don't believe additional taxes would be necessary.\19th District\John R.

I see no reason to amend Proposal A.\2. Without fundamental changes in overall economic policy, that's going to be\taking place 1over a wide spectrum of programs due to the collapsing state\revenue base. Budgets at local, state and federal levels are blowing out, and\Michigan's rainy day fund is a prime example. It's practically disappeared.\3. We definitely need to do something to modernize and upgrade our transit\system. Higher taxes are not the answer and I don't know that a state subsidy\is the answer, considering that the state is already broke. What we need is\long-term, low-interest credit from our federal government -- 1 to 2 percent\interest over 25-50 years -- directed toward a major infrastructure\rebuilding, which would definitely include mass transit.\Michael Shesterkin\Party: Libertarian\Age: 43\Residence: Livonia\Background: Has worked in the automotive supply industry for over 19 years.\Education: AAS, Ferris State University; BS, Lawrence Technological University\Personal: Married, two children\Questions:\1. Schools should not be financed through the state. As a step toward\returning control to parents, school districts should be allowed to seek\additional millages. It costs more than $7,000 per year to educate a student\in Michigan. Returning school financing to the local level will significantly\reduce this cost.\2. The state should not be responsible for social welfare programs. Charity is\best left to individuals and private charities. Taking the state out of social\welfare will lower taxes.\3. The state has no business funding any sort of public transit system.\Private enterprise and the spirit of America's entrepreneurs will provide the\best solution to the mass transit question.\20th District\John C.

For example, the Department of Environmental Quality and the\Department of Natural Resources.\3. This question is too complex to answer in 50 words or less.

Since an amendment would subvert the original purpose of Proposal A, I\would not support 1an amendment without a complete reappraisal of property\taxes and their usage.\2. The state should reduce the amount of money allocated to anti-smoking,\anti-drug and other programs designed to affect personal/individual\preferences. The programs are ineffective as well as an inappropriate use of\public funds.\3. There is no indication that a regional public transportation system could\attract enough riders to be of significant benefit to the region as a whole.\Such systems require significant on-going expenditures and are likely to be\seen as state-owned rather than merely subsidized.\21st District\Philip J.

No. Proposal A should not be amended. It has been a significant factor in\school equity in Michigan and brought tax relief to all homeowners.

We owe\it to our children and to our future to keep the promise of Proposal A and\continue to work toward greater equity in school funding.\2.

The Detroit News
\
Sylvan Township -- A crash on Interstate 94 near Chelsea killed a man and numerous spinouts were reported Friday as Metro Detroiters got one of their first tastes of this season's winter weather.
\
Sgt. Tony Cuevas of the Ypsilanti Post of the Michigan State Police said the 6:15 a.m. crash near the Kalmbach Road exit claimed the life of Alan Hinz, a 56-year-old man from Munith in Jackson County.
\
Hinz's vehicle struck another car that had struck the guardrail. That driver had left the vehicle because she knew the car was in a precarious spot, Cuevas said.
\
""A second vehicle, also traveling east on I-94, lost control on suspected black ice and struck the first vehicle,"" Cuevas said.
\
Cold weather conditions, such as the black ice that is believed to have caused Friday's crash, can sneak up on motorists and create similar scenes throughout Metro Detroit.
\
Drivers will have to be more alert this winter as area road commissions are expected to do more with less this season because of budget shortfalls.
\
Oakland County plans to spread less salt per mile this season. The move should save money and help the environment but have little impact on motorist safety, according to Richard Skarritt, board chairman of the Road Commission for Oakland County.
\
Road Commission drivers will pepper 400 pounds of salt, instead of 800 pounds, for every mile of two-lane pavement.
\
Skarritt told The Detroit News earlier that the county would have fewer trucks on the road this year -- having trimmed its snow-removal employee roster from 190 to 150. Other road commissions also were forced to cut costs in all areas of the budget. Commissions have seen revenue drops produced by Michigan's gas tax for the past four years.
\
The Washtenaw County Road Commission will have a 25 percent decrease in its budget in 2010.
\
Spending on road projects alone will drop from $25 million in 2009 to $11.5 million next year in a plan approved by the county's board of commissioners this month.

170,"WASHINGTON - President George W. Bush rejected calls to increase the federal fuel tax Thursday, saying Congress could serve the nation's infrastructure needs by better prioritizing how it spends money.\Since last week's collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minnesota focused attention on the nation's infrastructure needs, bipartisan calls have emerged to increase the 18.4 cents-a-gallon fuel tax, which hasn't been raised since 1993.\The chairman of the House Transportation Committee, Rep. Jim Oberstar, D-Minn., on Wednesday proposed a 5-cent increase in the federal gas tax to establish a fund for repairing or replacing structurally deficient highway bridges.\""The way it seems to have worked is that each member on that committee gets to set his or her own priorities first,"" Bush said Thursday. ""That's not the right way to prioritize the people's money.\""Before we raise taxes, which could affect economic growth, I would strongly urge the Congress to examine how they set priorities.""\Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said she would ask Bush to redirect $2.1 billion in unspent Iraq reconstruction funds to emergency repairs. She said that if he doesn't agree, she would pursue it using legislation.\According to the U.S. Transportation Department, more than 70,000 bridges are rated as structurally deficient, including the bridge that collapsed in Minneapolis. The American Society of Civil Engineers has said that repairing them all would require at least $9.4 billion a year for 20 years.\Meanwhile, in Minnesota:\* Searchers found at least two more bodies Thursday in the wreckage, bringing the count to at least seven. Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Andrew Baker said what first was thought to be one set of remains now is thought to be from more than one person.\* The company that was doing construction work at the site rejected a report that a worker noticed unusual swaying of the bridge days before its collapse.\POLL FINDINGS: Three of four people in a nationwide Associated Press-Ipsos poll expressed confidence in the condition of bridges in their states. Yet, most said last week's disaster pointed to a wider problem. The poll, conducted Monday-Wednesday, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\ILLUSTRATION: Photo\CAPTION: A vehicle is hoisted Thursday from the wreckage of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis.

washington -- Congress returns Tuesday for a four-week legislative sprint to confront a number of domestic and foreign policy matters before lawmakers adjourn for the annual August break.
\
A long-delayed transportation bill will take top billing with a July 31 deadline looming on how to keep funding flowing to the nation's highways and other infrastructure projects.
\
The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee recently approved a six-year highway bill, but how to pay for it remains a significant hurdle. Many lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to pay for it in part by raising the gas tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But that's a non-starter for the GOP-controlled Congress. There is also a bipartisan effort afoot to raise revenues by raising taxes on profits U.S. companies earn overseas.
\
The highway bill is also expected to become a vehicle for a fight over whether to reauthorize the Export Import Bank of the United States, the nation's official export credit agency, whose charter expired on July 1.
\
The House and Senate are scheduled to take up a six-year reauthorization of the federal education law overseeing elementary and secondary education.
\
The Senate may try again to take up legislation overhauling the nation's cyber-security laws after an attempt to add it to a defense bill last month failed.
\
Congress may also be thrust into the ongoing international talks to get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions if the six world powers negotiating the deal strike a final agreement this month.
\
Then, of course, there are the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government. The House is nearing completion of its work, but Senate Democrats are blocking appropriations bills from moving in the Senate in order to force larger budget talks to set new spending levels for defense and domestic programs.

As a constituent from St. Johns, I recently met with Rep. Paul Opsommer, R-DeWitt, and urged him to protect the health of Michigan residents by supporting House Bill 4163. I'd like to thank Opsommer for agreeing to support the Senate-passed version, which would make all Michigan workplaces, including restaurants and bars, smoke-free.
\
If passed, HB 4163 would protect all Michigan workers, including bar and restaurant employees, from the deadly toxins of secondhand smoke. Food service workers are 50 percent more likely to develop lung cancer largely because of their exposure to secondhand smoke at work.
\
As a nurse, I have seen the undesirable effects of secondhand smoke. Heart disease, lung cancer and triggered asthma attacks have shortened the lives of our friends, families and neighbors.
\
Opsommer deserves credit for taking a stand and protecting residents' health. It's time for Michigan to go smoke-free by enacting the Senate's legislation.

Lindemann excels
\
Ingham County Drain Commissioner Patrick Lindemann has done a masterful job in his office, maintaining clean water resources for its residents. His forward-thinking and progressive plans have drawn international attention, and rightly so.
\
Our local rivers are so much cleaner than they were 30 years ago, and Lindemann's determined effort that they improve even more will pay off for all, now and in the future. The Tollgate Wetlands Project, the Towar Gardens rain gardens, the Michigan Avenue/Washington Mall rain gardens, the Linn Road project and many other plans create a cleaner environment for all of Ingham County.
\
I wish Lindemann could manage water resources for the entire Great Lakes region. I will always support him in his current office, and am grateful that we have him as a trustworthy steward for our local waters.

Boost food aid
\
The food stamp program is our nation's primary defense against hunger. However, the average benefit is not adequate to meet the nutritional standards set by the U.S. Agriculture Department. Nor is it sufficient to help struggling families meet today's rising food prices.
\
I am grateful Congress has increased nutrition assistance in the farm bill, but it is a shame that Congress has not substantially reformed commodity programs.
\
The farm bill concentrates payments to wealthy farmers and landowners when it could have done more to support rural development and the efforts of small farmers to feed their families.
\
I urge our Michigan legislators to be leaders on the scandal of hunger by supporting Bread for the World's legislative efforts to increase food stamp benefit levels and funding for national nutrition programs such as WIC and the Emergency Food Assistance Program.

Response disturbs
\
I was incredulous last week when I saw on the news that the Ingham County drain commissioner was shouting and swearing at citizens at a meeting in Bancroft Park.
\
It seems they were asking him how much the new Groesbeck Drain project was going to cost them. Apparently, he said, ""It'll cost what it costs.""
\
How can a public official be more out of touch? I think it's time we get a new drain commissioner who will treat citizens with the respect they deserve.

Leave fuel tax alone
\
Eliminating the state gas tax to aid Michigan's tourist industry is a bad idea.
\
The tax is there for a reason, namely to fill the potholes we see everywhere.
\
In fact, the higher gas prices will probably aid Michigan tourism as people vacation nearer to home.
\
High gas prices can only be meaningfully solved by reducing consumption with more fuel-efficient cars and trucks and shifting the shipment of goods to the railroads.
\
Let's get on with it and not be diverted by stop-gap measures.

Detroit News Lansing Bureau
\
Ann Arbor venture capitalist Rick Snyder said Tuesday he plans to run an administration based on innovation, merit, competition and other sound business practices if he's elected governor.
\
The Republican candidate told The Detroit News editorial board he'd hire the best qualified people to operate the government, including members of both parties, some already in the bureaucracy and S.W.A.T. teams of volunteers from the outside.
\
""I'd find the best people already there and leverage their experience, put them on a different path,"" Snyder said.
\
""Political party is not a key driver; it's the merit system.""
\
Snyder, who has based his campaign on playing up his experience as a former CEO and job creator, also promised to simplify the state's business tax. He wants a flat 6 percent levy on business income that would result in a tax cut of about $1.5 billion.
\
""That makes us very competitive,"" he said, adding the current Michigan Business Tax is ""terrible ... it's a blinking red light: job killer, stay away.""
\
He said it's not an appropriate time to push an expansion of the sales tax to services or a gas tax hike to fix roads and bridges.
\
Snyder acknowledged he didn't have to negotiate labor contracts as head of Gateway computers or as an investor. ""But I had to create an environment of success,"" he said.
\
Asked how long it'll take to right the Michigan ship, Snyder said: ""It's not a light switch thing. It's going to be gradual. This is a grind-it-out situation.""
\
But he said there will be some positive signs in the first year and he promised to put his plan in place and get it functioning in his first term.
\
Measures of his success should be: ""Did I do what I said I was going to do, and did I build a long-term legacy for success?""
\
Regarding the Republican primary race, Snyder said bolstering his name recognition will be his most difficult task leading up to the Aug. 3 primary election day.
\
Also running on the GOP side are U.S. Rep. Pete Hoekstra of Holland, Attorney General Mike Cox, Oakland County Sheriff Mike Bouchard and state Sen. Tom George of Kalamazoo.

174,"OK. Let's see what might be bothering you today.\Talk to me:\No Name from Fort Gratiot: ""I am posing a question to all of the residents of St. Clair County. Why on earth do we have to suffer through being in a simulated war zone every time there is a holiday? I can understand the Fourth of July, but I cannot understand the very solemn holiday of Memorial Day. I'm just asking this question. I hope everyone else in the area is just as sick of it and abhorrent of it. I hope there are some other individuals who will call in and voice their opinions. Not only is it bad for the environment, but our poor animals suffer extreme, severe trauma from this.""\Look to Lansing. Michigan lawmakers are responsible. They enacted legislation to promote fireworks and to permit them on most holidays.\No Name: ""I agree with Dan Lauwers. There definitely ought to be some sort of guarantees on the construction of these roads. If these roads fall apart sooner than they're supposed to, the government shouldn't have to pay. That should be the responsibility of the road construction company and their engineers, possibly. They should have to put money in escrow or buy an insurance policy, that they pay for, to cover the cost of new roads or fixing the old ones that fall apart. As far as a gas tax, I feel we should be able to vote on this. They don't want to give anybody a minimum wage raise so they can pay for gas, but they're going to raise the gas taxes? That's ridiculous!""\An Atkins Road Resident: ""I remind motorists using Atkins Road to please slow down and pay attention to your driving. About a month ago, two mailboxes were hit and rarely does anyone ever stop and offer to pay for the damage. On Saturday, a vehicle ended up in the ditch and hopefully no one was hurt. It hit one culvert, crossed a driveway, hit another culvert and sheered off a fire hydrant. Mud and sod covered the yard and about 100 feet of chain-link fence. When are these drivers going to take responsibility for their actions? So far, no one has been killed, but it's bound to happen. You were lucky!""\Matt: ""If I remember correctly, when the seat belt law was enacted in Michigan, residents were told it was to be held as a secondary enforcement, meaning the police would never pull a citizen over for not wearing their seat belt. Some 30 short years later, we now have 'seat belt enforcement zones,' where citizens are mandatorily checked to see if they are wearing their seat belts and to find out what else they may be up to.

The total for roads is slightly higher than what was included in the current year's budget.\The plan also includes a slight increase in revenue-sharing dollars for counties and maintains full funding for cities, villages and townships -- even though Gov.

176,"FREE PRESS COLUMNIST\Good evening. ... Tonight, I've returned from a trip to the gulf coast to speak with you about the battle we're waging against an oil spill that is assaulting our shores and our citizens.\Not to mention my approval ratings and my legislative agenda.\We've directed BP to mobilize additional equipment and technology. And in the coming weeks and days, these efforts should capture up to 90% of the oil leaking out of the well.\Unless it turns out that the leak is 90% bigger than our most recent estimate -- which, let's face it, is entirely possible.\I've authorized the deployment of more than 17,000 National Guard members along the coast. These servicemen and women are ready to help stop the oil from coming ashore; they're ready to help clean the beaches, train response workers or even help with processing claims.\If you've never watched 17,000 heavily armed soldiers processing insurance claims, you're in for an impressive spectacle.\Tomorrow, I will meet with the chairman of BP and inform him that he is to set aside whatever resources are required to compensate the workers and business owners who have been harmed as a result of his company's recklessness.\Bam! Kapow! Big stick!\And this fund will not be controlled by BP. In order to ensure that all legitimate claims are paid out in a fair and timely manner, the account must and will be administered by an independent third party.\To those who doubt my legal authority, I pose this question: Have YOU ever tried to leave the Oval Office when the Secret Service wasn't ready for you to leave?\But no matter how much we improve our regulation of the industry, drilling for oil these days entails greater risk.\Careful, here comes the tricky part:\For decades, we've talked and talked about the need to end America's century-long addiction to fossil fuels. Countries like China are investing in clean energy jobs and industries that should be right here in America.\Of course, China's oil company execs work for the government. When THEY complain, President Hu Jintao just rips out their phones.\As we recover from this recession, the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of jobs -- but only if we accelerate that transition. Only if we seize the moment. Only if we raise the federal gas tax and use the proceeds to subsidize alternative energy development. Ha! Can you imagine the heart attack Axelrod would have if I actually SAID that?\Now, there are costs associated with this transition. I say we can't afford not to change how we produce and use energy -- because the long-term costs to our economy, our national security, and our environment are far greater.\And that, boys and girls, is about as close as I'm going to get to endorsing a carbon cap in this or any election year.\What has defined us as a nation since our founding is our determination to fight for the America we want for our children. Even if we're unsure exactly what that looks like. Even if we don't yet know precisely how we're going to get there. We know we'll get there.\I've been talking for almost 20 minutes.

177,"WASHINGTON -- Motorists might find the high price of gasoline painful this Memorial Day\weekend, but it could improve their quality of life.\After 15 months of high gasoline prices, people say they are driving less,\surveys show. If prices remain high, people also would buy smaller, more\fuel-efficient cars. Together, that should lead to fewer traffic jams and\accidents, cleaner air and possibly a slowing of global warming.\The impact of higher gasoline prices, which have risen 28 cents a gallon on\average since late March, illustrates an often glossed-over trade-off in the\debate about energy policy.\Low energy prices fuel economic growth and give more people the means to drive\bigger cars and enjoy the comforts of central air conditioning. By encouraging\power consumption, low prices also make it harder to breathe, shroud skylines\in smog and tie people up in traffic jams, all factors possibly as important\to quality of life as the comforts of economic well-being.\One answer to this conundrum: Raise fuel prices to a level that better\balances economic growth with environmental costs. Gasoline prices in the\United States overly favor the economic side of the equation, economists say.\While some lawmakers want to suspend all or part of the federal gasoline tax\of 18.4 cents a gallon this summer to give drivers a break, many economists\say the gas tax should be increased instead.\""Overall, the benefits of cleaner air and freer-flowing traffic will exceed\the costs of having to pay more for energy,"" said Ian Parry of Resources for\the Future, a Washington-based policy research institute focusing on the\environment and transportation.\From an economist's viewpoint, the tax on gasoline should reflect the added\costs to society from consumption of the fuel, such as health costs and time\lost in traffic jams.\Based on recent studies, Parry estimates the environmental and congestion\costs combined to be 84 cents to $1.12 a gallon. A $1 tax would push the\current U.S. price of regular gasoline up to $2.29 a gallon.\Market forces are expected to keep gasoline prices up for some time. The\nationwide average price of regular has risen to $1.69 a gallon from about\$1.18 in May 1999. Prices in some parts of the country are higher.\As a result, 52 percent of Americans are driving less to save money, according\to a poll released Thursday by the Pew Research Center for the People and the\Press. Also, 36 percent of the respondents said they are considering buying a\car that gets better gas mileage.\The nationwide survey of 1,202 adults was conducted May 15-20 and had a margin\of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\The price of gasoline is lower than in Europe, Canada and Japan, all of which\have higher taxes. The British pay $4.26 for a gallon of gasoline, including\$3.12 a gallon in taxes.\Taxes in the United States vary from place to place, with states and some\local governments adding taxes on top of the 18.4 cents a gallon federal tax.\State levies range from 7.5 cents in Georgia to 29 cents in Rhode Island. On\average, total taxes on gasoline add up to about 40 cents a gallon.\DISCLAIMER: THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION MAY DIFFER SLIGHTLY FROM THE PRINTED ARTICLE."

180,"Democrats campaigned on promises of making sweeping changes to the nation's energy policy, but it's unlikely they'll deliver on most of those promises.\The new Democratic-controlled Congress is expected to place greater emphasis on renewable energy sources and end the drive to open offshore areas to oil and natural gas production.\But Democrats who will have jurisdiction over energy issues indicated they aren't planning a big energy bill next year.\""We're going to have smaller, more manageable, more digestible"" legislation, said Bill Wicker, spokesman for Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, the new Democratic chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\The new Congress is expected to debate ways to cut greenhouse gases to fight global warming and press for increased efficiency standards for cars and other gas-operated machines. Democrats also are expected to champion proposals that would require utilities to produce a percentage of their electricity output from renewable energy sources.\Producers of solar power, wind power, geothermal power and other technologies that use wood or waste products to generate energy also are expected to receive new tax breaks from the Democratic Congress.\But the biggest change in energy policy is expected to come through a farm bill Congress hopes to consider next year that would provide new incentives for the production of ethanol, a corn-derived fuel.\Many Democrats campaigned against Big Oil this year, tying Republicans to an industry that critics say pollutes the environment and manipulates prices.\If Democrats follow through on their campaign promises, ""it could be very difficult for the oil and gas industry next year,"" said Jeff Eshelman, spokesman for the Independent Petroleum Association of America.\While the oil industry has Democratic friends like Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, it has many more Republican allies. That's why the GOP's loss of control of Congress is a blow to the industry.\The GOP-controlled 109th Congress approved billions of dollars in new tax breaks for oil and natural gas producers. Against a backdrop of spiking energy prices and $3-a-gallon gasoline, Republicans also pressed to open new areas to drilling.\While the Republican-led Congress failed to win approval for production in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or eliminate federal drilling bans along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, a new area in the Gulf of Mexico was opened to drilling.\Incoming Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has promised to block any efforts to open new offshore areas to drilling and to eliminate about $2.6 billion in tax breaks to the oil industry. The money would instead be used to provide tax breaks to producers of renewable fuels.\The Senate may blunt House efforts to eliminate oil and gas tax breaks. Bingaman, who comes from an oil-producing state, said that might drive oil companies overseas and hamper efforts to make the United States less dependent on foreign oil.\But there's more bad news for the industry.\Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., who will head the House Resources Committee in the new Congress, wants to stop offering oil and gas companies the chance to pay lower royalty payments as an incentive for drilling in the deepest waters in the Gulf of Mexico.\""The oil and gas royalties system has never worked,"" Rahall said. ""Instead, it has proven to be a form of corporate welfare that has enabled oil and gas producers to undercut payments due the American people.""\Rahall also is expected to look for ways to help the coal industry, a major employer in his home state. That worries environmentalists.\Bob Sargent, energy program director for U.S. PIRG, said there's pent-up public concern about global warming and the need to find clean, renewable forms of energy.\The Democratic leadership ""recognizes that good energy policy is good politics,"" Sargent said.\""The oil and gas royalties system has never worked.""Rep.

181,"The war of words and numbers over the nearly $60 billion state budget continued Thursday as legislative conference committees began approving department budgets, even though negotiations with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer broke down.\The biggest point of contention between the Republican-controlled state House of Representatives and Senate and Whitmer, an East Lansing Democrat, continued to be fixing the damn roads. Whitmer wants a dedicated, long-term source of funding to begin addressing the $2.5 billion that's needed annually for road repairs.\""This phony game that we're fixing things with one-time money is not going to cut it. I've told the public, I'm going to be honest about the size of the problem,"" Whitmer said. ""(Republicans) are not serious about fixing the roads, they are not serious about negotiating budgets.""\Meanwhile, Republicans said there was an agreement to separate the budget from the roads debate, but they still wanted to put $500 million in general fund dollars into roads this year and then work on a long-term fix after the rest of the budget is done.\""The agreement between us is that we would stop talking about long-term sustainable road funding, but we never contemplated or agreed not to have one-time funding for roads,"" Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, said. ""I'm still committed to finding a long-term road funding plan. I think we have an obligation to do so.""\In her budget, Whitmer proposed a .45-cents per gallon gas tax to be used for roads. Republicans -- and some Democrats -- never bought into that plan, so the governor and GOP leadership initially agreed last week to remove the roads debate from the budget negotiations. The timing is key because the fiscal year begins on Oct. 1 and if the budget isn't done before then, the specter of a government shutdown looms.\Republicans went on summer break on June 20 without completing the budget and didn't return to Lansing until the end of August. It's a point that Whitmer has repeatedly used to criticize the Legislature for waiting until the last minute to come up with a budget deal. And now that lawmakers are passing budgets, the prospect of a veto from Whitmer also is on the horizon.\""They gotta do what they gotta do. And then I'm gonna do what I gotta do,"" she told reporters Thursday. ""This is the worst way to go about doing this. It's the exact kind of gimmick that got us in this problem in the first place.""\But Speaker of the House Lee Chatfield, R-Levering, said there will be negotiations both on the upcoming budget and a long-term road funding plan.\""Rather than just playing politics and putting a budget on the governor's desk, we've negotiated with her throughout the summer and proposed several alternatives to put record funding towards roads,"" he said. ""And then continue having the conversation on a long-term structural fix for the roads.""\Republicans have suggested that a long-term plan could include ending the sales tax on fuel and passing an equivalent per-gallon gasoline tax increase, which would boost funding for roads but reduce revenue for schools and municipalities. They've also suggested extending payments to the teacher pension funds for five or more years.\Department budgets that got approved Thursday in conference committees were:\The school aid budget, which funds K-12, includes $304 million to provide per-pupil funding increases ranging from $120 to $240. The minimum allowance would go from $7,871 up to $8,111, while the maximum allowance would go from $8,409 to $8,529.\Michigan State Police, which includes $8 million for a trooper school to train an additional 75 state troopers, and $3 million for background checks and investigations for the new recreational marijuana law.\Environment Great Lakes and Energy, which includes $120 million for drinking water protection initiatives.\Community Colleges, with a 1.6% increase.\Higher Education, which included a 3% increase from the 2018-19 budget.\The rest of the department budgets will be taken up Sept. 19, but they won't necessarily represent the final product that gets presented to Whitmer.\Contact Kathleen Gray: 313-223-4430, kgray99@freepress.com or on Twitter @michpoligal.\CREDIT: Kathleen Gray"

183,"While Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is pushing a 45-cent per gallon gas tax hike to repair Michigan roads, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a lawsuit to shut down the Line 5 pipeline, creating significant concerns about adding thousands of trucks per day on our roads to deliver what Line 5 is currently delivering and fulfilling the energy needs of Michigan and northern Ohio.\The debate over Line 5 is one of environmental concern and economic cost.\Enbridge, Inc. is a Canadian company that owns and operates a large system of pipelines that transport oil and natural gas across Canada and the Unites States.\It currently is attempting to improve a portion of Line 5 underneath the Straits of Mackinac. Line 5 carries oil from Superior, Wisconsin through Michigan's Upper Peninsula and a portion of northern Michigan.\This segment of pipeline has never leaked and is inspected regularly by Enbridge. These inspections as reported by federal pipeline regulatory officials, have found the pipe in very good condition.\In response to concerns of the effects of a potential major oil spill, Enbridge came to an agreement with the state of Michigan to make a safe pipeline even safer. The company agreed to spend $500 million to construct a new pipeline at the Straits and house it in a protective tunnel more than 100 feet into bedrock below the lake bed. This would virtually eliminate the chance of a leak into the Straits area.\The completion time for the new pipeline is expected to be five years; one year for geotechnical investigations, two years for final design and permitting and two years for construction.\Regardless of the agreement, Gov. Whitmer tried to renegotiate with Enbridge but openly suggested that the company shut down Line 5 within two years — before the tunnel and replacement is complete.\Attorney General Nessel then took legal action to close the entire pipeline. The cost of shutting down Line 5 would be substantial compared to the costs of halting the operation of the existing pipeline.\Transportation of oil is two to three times more expensive by rail than pipeline and four times more expensive by truck. Adding 2,000 trucks per day to our roads to deliver Line 5 products could drive up the cost of road repairs.\Certainly the risk of a leak of the pipeline under the Straits is not zero, and cleanup costs would be substantial. However, as with any uncertainty, one must look at the ""expected cost,"" which would be the cost adjusted for the probability of the event occurring.\Once the new pipeline exists, in five years or less, the probability of a leakage affecting the environment will be near zero.\Given the condition of the existing pipeline and the fact it has never leaked, the probability is very low of a major leak in the interim and thus the expected savings from shutting down Line 5 would be very low.\While there is a remote possibility of a leak from Line 5 in the next five years, the cost to our economy by halting the pipeline rather than going forward with the construction of a new line embedded in a tunnel 100 feet below the water line is also likely to be substantially greater than any potential benefit.\Gary Wolfram is an economics professor at Hillsdale College.\Gary Wolfram\Guest Columnist\Lansing State Journal\USA TODAY NETWORK – MICH."

Should Michigan reform term limits?
\
Two years won't help
\
Bill Rustem protests that term limits are good -- ours are just too short, compared with other states (""Short terms hamstring Michigan lawmakers,"" Oct. 24). Well, 15 other states' voters limited politicians' terms.
\
Only three allow more time in the state Senate than Michigan. The people in nine other states allow representatives to serve up to eight years, two more than Michigan allows.
\
Does Rustem really contend that two more years in the state House will transform the legislators he rightly excoriates as lacking in principle? This is not the first term limited state House Michigan has had; it is the third in a row. If term limits caused the problem, it would have appeared before now.

Challenge abortion attitude
\
I agree with George Will (""Overturning Roe v. Wade would not end abortion,"" Oct. 30). A reversal of Roe v. Wade is either unlikely or would be ineffective in ending abortion, given the culture. However, Americans (and certainly, their leaders) should challenge the assumption that abortion promotes the common good. This most common surgical procedure causes the death of an innocent human life.

They might be pleasantly surprised to learn how many adults there are if they stopped treating us as children.

185,"Roses:\An overdue delivery of roses to the Marshall District Library and its staff! Raising teenagers can be a challenge, but with the invaluable services MDL offers to area youth, it makes the job a whole lot easier. MDL, in particular, librarian assistant Diane Hamlin, does an incredible job listening to the needs and requests of area youth, while guiding both middle and high school advisory groups in offering an array of opportunities. The students' leadership skills are honed by organizing events with cooperative teamwork and decision-making, hosting events like Lego contests, board games, role-play, book discussions, and music exploration --just to name a few. Although each activity may not be for everyone, the youth from Marshall and surrounding areas can explore their varied interests while making new friends in both a safe and positive environment. Thank you, MDL, Teen Advisory Board, and Junior Teen Advisory Board for all that you do; quite honestly, I can't imagine a better way to spend our tax dollars! -- Beth Eggers Ruffing, Marshall\The Bedford Lionesses would like to send out large bouquets of roses to everyone who helped to make our luncheon/style show a hit! And a good fundraiser to help us be able to keep giving back to the community. Thanks to Barney's Bar, Continental Bakery, Urbandale Family Fare, and Meijer. To Bon Worth, who supplied the outfits for our models to wear and look so stunning and our guests that made it complete! Thank you. -- The Bedford Lionesses\Raspberries:\Gas-tank full of raspberries to the Senate Republicans for once-again, shafting hard working families of Michigan and those on fixed incomes with 300 percent increase in gas tax just because you gave corporate contributors a welfare check of $1.5 billion dollars annually that used to pay for roads/infrastructure. More examples of failed policies for Michigan just like Gateway Computer Company (another Enron). -- Bill Courliss, Union City\A massive wet raspberry to the older couple who I saw on May 22, at Memorial Park Cemetery, on Esther Drive, in the older red Cavalier, while sitting by my husband's grave eating lunch. There is a rule there: NO DOGS. I didn't appreciate your poodle hopping out of your car, trotting over to someone's monument, and promptly lifting his leg to relieve himself. But that wasn't the worst of it. I sat watching, after you put flowers on your loved one's grave (not the one that had been peed on by your dog, by the way), as the missus and her peeing pooch walked away for a bit ... and while the mister sat in the car for a moment, only to then open the door, stand up, and begin relieving himself! There are bathrooms in both the chapel and the office! I should've confronted you, but I was in total shock and disbelief as to what I was seeing. But, know this, if I ever catch you doing it again, the police will be called, and you'll be charged with urinating in public and indecent exposure! You are disgusting, disrespectful people.

""I'm still committed to finding a long-term road funding plan. I think we have an obligation to do so.""\In her budget, Whitmer proposed a 45-cents-per-gallon gas tax to be used for roads. Republicans -- and some Democrats -- never bought into that plan, so the governor and GOP leadership initially agreed last week to remove the roads debate from the budget negotiations. The timing is key because the fiscal year begins Oct. 1 and if the budget isn't done before then, the specter of a government shutdown looms.\Republicans went on summer break on June 20 without completing the budget and didn't return to Lansing until the end of August.

""And then continue having the conversation on a long-term structural fix for the roads.""\Republicans have suggested that a long-term plan could include ending the sales tax on fuel and passing an equivalent per-gallon gasoline tax increase, which would boost funding for roads but reduce revenue for schools and municipalities. They've also suggested extending payments to the teacher pension funds for five or more years.\Department budgets that got approved Thursday in conference committees were:\The school aid budget, which funds K-12, includes $304 million to provide per-pupil funding increases ranging from $120 to $240.

189,"LANSING – Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Wednesday she won't sign a budget that doesn't include a real plan to fix the state's roads and Republicans have still not presented her with one.\But House Speaker Lee Chatfield, R-Levering, said it is the governor who is holding up the process by refusing to ""drop her insistence on a 45-cent gas tax"" as a budget centerpiece.\And Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, said his caucus is ready to finalize a budget without a road funding deal, which he said can be handled separately.\Whitmer's budget director, Chris Kolb, said the administration is preparing for a possible partial government shutdown on Oct. 1 by determining what critical functions would have to continue and what resources would be needed to support them.\""You should ask the Republican leadership to show you their plan,"" Whitmer said at a news conference.\""It's time for them to offer up something that is a legitimate alternative,"" she said.\""Stop screwing around and get it done.""\Whitmer delivered her message with just over a month to go before the Oct. 1 start of the 2020 fiscal year — the deadline for having an approved budget in place.\Whitmer has repeatedly blasted Republican lawmakers for taking an extended summer break without sending her a budget that includes a realistic plan to fix Michigan roads. House and Senate Republicans, who have each come up with their own budget plans that still need to be melded into a unified proposal, insist they have continued to work on road funding plans throughout the summer and have been in regular contact with the governor.\They also say that each of their budgets include record funding for K-12 schooling.\Republicans presented Whitmer last week with what has been described as a ""menu of options"" for increasing road funding. Whitmer says GOP leaders gave her ""an unacceptable proposal that will cut education spending by $400 per pupil statewide and doesn't raise the revenue we need to fix the roads.""\Chatfield said GOP leaders have presented Whitmer with a range of options for increasing road funding, but Whitmer asked that their conversations be kept confidential. He said he plans to honor his commitment not to discuss the road funding negotiations in the media.\At the same time, ""we cannot hold the budget hostage because of her desire to tax every driver in our state,"" Chatfield said.\Shirkey accused Whitmer of manufacturing a crisis.\""I'm willing to continue to talk,"" Shirkey said. ""But we have to pivot and also progress on a budget because the citizens of Michigan deserve the certainty of a budget being done.""\Shirkey said even without a road funding deal, Republicans will present a budget with ""record spending for ... education and additional funding for roads."" Also, ""she'll have the budget in plenty of time,"" he said.\The governor has specifically rejected proposals to borrow against school pension funds or to free up extra money by delaying some pension fund payments.\Whitmer's proposal to raise Michigan's fuel tax by 45 cents per gallon is estimated to increase transportation funding by $2.5 billion a year. The net increase for roads under Whitmer's plan would be closer to $1.9 billion because she would shift about $600 million in general fund revenues now targeted for roads back into other priority areas, such as higher education and the environment.\Increasingly, Whitmer is citing the significant number of closed or compromised bridges around the state and the potential threat to public safety, not just from a potential bridge failure but from lengthy detours that emergency vehicles are forced to take as a result of bridge closures. She also said lousy roads are a threat to Michigan's business climate generally and its plans to be a national center for development of automated vehicles, specifically.\Whitmer\CREDIT: Paul Egan; Kathleen Gray"

191,"Terris Todd, candidate for Michigan 62nd House District, said he would seek to reach across the party aisle to find ""a common ground"" if elected.\""One of the things that have always bothered for the most part is the partisan politics,"" Todd said Friday. ""It's children in the marketplace. So my thing, to be honest with you, is to develop a more common ground. Because when you really sit back and you look, you basically want the same thing. We want a true quality of life for us and our families, we want to be able to live in a nation where we're free to express ourselves or even just to have an opportunity to live a progressive life for generations to come.""\Todd, one of five candidates for Rep. Kate Segal's seat, sat down for an interview with WMUK Radio and the Enquirer. The Calhoun County commissioner from Battle Creek faces two fellow Democrats -- Battle Creek City Commissioner Andy Helmboldt and former Calhoun County Democratic Party Chair Dave Morgan. There are also two Republicans, Calhoun County Board Chair Art Kale and Dr. John Bizon, running for the 62nd District seat.\Segal, D-Battle Creek, cannot run again because of term limits.\Todd said he supported the recent minimum wage increase signed into law by Gov. Rick Snyder, saying it was better than no action. It's an issue Todd said hits close to home because he was raised by a single mother -- and although he would have liked to see the $10.10-per-hour citizens ballot initiative succeed, he would have voted for any increase.\""People are happy with at least being in the right direction headed towards the $10.10,"" he said. ""My ultimate goal would have been $10.10, but again, I am in support of the fact that it's signed in, we're at least headed in the right direction. They have at least some kind of increase to provide better for them and their kids.""\He applauded the county's recent job gains and workforce development in manufacturing, but called for additional training opportunities for other industries and encouraging entrepreneurship.\""If we are to be a relevant community where we are able to attract young professionals,"" Todd said, ""I think we have to do a better job of creating an environment which is supportive of that population of professionals, as well. I don't think we're really doing that good of a job, per se, as a community or even a county when it comes to the training aspects for those who are seeking things other than manufacturing.""\Todd applauded area townships seeking options for road funding; some are currently discussing possible millage proposals. His strategy? ""Just fund the roads,"" he said, not ruling out the possibility of toll roads or a gas-tax increase.\""I don't necessarily put the sole responsibility on the state,"" Todd said, ""but I think they should absolutely fund a large portion so that way, when it gets down to the townships, they're not bearing the brunt of the majority of those costs. I think they have some responsibility, but not sole responsibility, of their townships.""\Todd said he supported ""equality and justice for everyone"" and said same-sex couples should have the same benefits that come with traditional marriages. He said he would be willing to vote as a state representative to put the proposal back on the ballot.\""As an elected official, I have to stand with the voice of the people,"" Todd said. ""I think the voters should decide and that's what they decided -- right, wrong or indifferent, you have to respect that. It's the law. But if that voice has since changed, we have to be able to respect that, too.""\Todd said he supported the legalization of medical marijuana and said there was sufficient access for patients, despite the ban on storefront collectives. He said he did not support OKing recreational use but supported decriminalization.\Todd also applauded Segal, saying she has been a mentor who has served the district well. So far, Segal has not endorsed a candidate in the race. The primary is Aug. 5.\""I respect the fact that she has taken a neutral posture, if you will, for the sake of all things being equal,"" Todd said. ""I really commend her for that and allowing us to go out and make a name for ourselves, and at least try to tackle our issues on our own and, I guess, create our own following.""\Todd's interview will air during WMUK's ""WestSouthwest"" on 102.1 FM at 9:20 a.m. Monday.\Call Jennifer Bowman at 966-0589.

Attorney general brings fresh approach to government
\
We endorse: Jennifer Granholm, for governor
\
One definition of leadership is the ability to motivate people to do what they must - often against their self-interests.
\
That fairly describes the task facing Michigan's next governor.
\
The state's financial picture is the bleakest it's been in more than a decade. A revenue shortfall of $$@$!1 billion or more next year will torment lawmakers and the new governor, as they most certainly will have to make unpopular cuts in programs and services.
\
It will be painful. The resulting ill will is bound to rub off on the next governor.
\
Another definition of leadership is the ability to inspire during a crisis. Whether it's battling terrorists, or a terrible budget picture, people expect their leaders to exude confidence.
\
Michigan needs a leader who can unify and inspire. That is why Jennifer Granholm is our choice for governor.
\
Both Attorney General Granholm and Republican Lt. Gov. Dick Posthumus are, to varying degrees, running against Gov. John Engler. For all that Engler has done for Michigan, he has exacted a price. A pall of disunity hangs above the Capitol, and it was largely placed there by Engler.
\
Bipartisanship needed
\
Granholm promises to earnestly reach out to Republicans to tackle Michigan's budget crisis. Confrontation will be replaced by conciliation, she says. While it may be naive to suggest this can happen easily, Granholm seems sincere.
\
By contrast, Posthumus' campaign has been surprisingly nasty in tone. Surprising, because Posthumus is a decent man whose normal instincts are a far cry from Engler's take-no-prisoners approach.
\
Posthumus, consistently trailing Granholm in opinion polls, has run a desperate campaign that plays on fears, stereotypes and, yes, racial divisions in our state. His claim that Granholm does not have the ""Michigan values"" he has is a lame tactic - not to mention a tad goofy.
\
This is beneath him; a stain on a public career otherwise marked by personal integrity.
\
For her part, Granholm brings a clear-headed sense of what needs doing at the Capitol. First things first: The budget mess. Granholm says it will require a 5 percent cut in state spending.
\
Posthumus is more vague. He simply says he'll get it done, just as he helped cut the budget during the fiscal crisis of the early 1990s.
\
Posthumus has made a no-tax-hike pledge. To a large degree, so has Granholm. Her caveat is, if a national crisis occurs (future terrorist attacks, for instance), she would consider raising taxes as an option.
\
No leader should flatly refuse to raise taxes under any circumstances.
\
And, it should be pointed out, Posthumus is not immune to supporting tax increases. He supported a hike in the state gas tax in 1997, to rebuild Michigan roads.
\
There are many similarities in the two candidates' plans for Michigan, but Granholm's are more far-reaching and creative.
\
Agenda is ambitious
\
In education, she would launch a Great Start program to prepare kindergartners for school. This mirrors Lansing's Ready to Succeed program, and Head Start, both of which recognize the value of reaching and teaching pre-schoolers.
\
Granholm would create a ""tri-corridor"" of industry development from Detroit to Grand Rapids. The corridor would embrace 21st-century technology in automotive and life science research, as well as advances in homeland security.
\
In the latter, she says Michigan again could be the ""arsenal of democracy,"" this time in fighting terrorism with technology.
\
Granholm would re-merge the state departments of natural resources and environmental quality. That's important. It made no sense to split the DNR, as Engler has done. Natural resources and environmental quality go hand-in-hand.
\
Also on the environment: Granholm would expand the state's returnable container law to include water and noncarbonated beverage bottles. The proliferation of these throwaway containers demands a new approach.
\
Her ""Fix-It-First, Fix-It-Right"" program would focus on repairing existing roads before building new ones. And, importantly, she would dedicate $$@$!25 million a year from state gas taxes to rebuilding Michigan bridges, which are some of the worst in the country.
\
There is honest concern about whether Granholm has been thoroughly tested in the rough-and-tumble arena of state politics. After all, she's just finishing her first term in her first elected office.
\
There's also the sense she is too eager to please. She told a black audience in Detroit that she favors slave reparations, for example.
\
A fair-minded person might easily conclude she meant some type of monetary settlement. No, Granholm explained later, she meant ""repairing"" the damage done by slavery by such things as ensuring equal opportunity.
\
These are, hopefully, the mistakes of a political neophyte. They can be overcome by Granholm's intelligence, instincts, rich communication skills and sheer charisma.
\
Such traits can guide an untested leader in perilous times. Jennifer Granholm has them, and that should hold her in good stead as governor.

Gretchen Whitmer defended her extraordinary use of line-item vetoes to slash close to $1 billion from the 2020 state budget at a news conference Tuesday and called on Republican leaders to meet with her Thursday to restart negotiations on the spending plan.\""I know there are things they care about in this budget that are no longer a reality,"" Whitmer said.\""We have an opportunity to negotiate things back into the budget if the Legislature avails themselves of that opportunity.""\Whitmer, a Democrat, also defended many of the cuts as what she said were examples of pork barrel spending inserted into the budget by Republican lawmakers and said she had to make ""hard decisions"" to protect public health and safety.\""I do not relish using these powers, but they were absolutely necessary because the budgets they sent were fatally flawed,"" she said.\On eliminating the Pure Michigan tourism promotion campaign, for example, Whitmer said: ""I love Pure Michigan,"" and ""I think it's a fantastic ad campaign.""\But she said other Republican cuts, such as ones to the Corrections Department, had endangered public safety, and in attempting to reshape the budget, ""I'm always going to put public safety ... ahead of an ad campaign.""\She acknowledged there is a risk that Republican lawmakers will allow the cuts to stand, rather than negotiate a new budget deal.\""If they do that, it's going to be on them,"" she said.\Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, said he's in ""no rush"" to address the vetoes.\""There is no amount of red pen usage that will result in enough green buttons pushed in the Senate to get my governor what she wants,"" Shirkey said.\Other controversial funding vetoes include $38 million in higher education tuition grants, $10 million for ""secure schools,"" $1.6 million for ""strict discipline academies,"" and $600,000 for traffic control at the Michigan International Speedway.\Some of the cuts resulting from vetoes appeared targeted at rural areas that tend to elect Republican lawmakers. Those include $13.1 million for secondary road patrols, $16.6 million for rural hospitals, and close to $8 million to pay for rural obstetricians. Whitmer also vetoed tens of millions of dollars in rate increases for hospitals, pediatric psychiatrists, neonatologists, and private duty nurses.\""The elimination of funding for hospitals further exacerbates the financial burden on Michigan hospitals, primarily those that are small or rural, and threatens access to care in our most vulnerable communities,"" said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health and Hospital Association.\And in a fund transfer, Whitmer moved money allocated for the Van Andel Institute, a biomedical research and science education organization in Grand Rapids, and shifted it to help Healthy Michigan plan enrollees meet state work requirements that were put into law by the GOP Legislature. Jay Van Andel founded Amway with Rich DeVos, whose family is a huge bankroller of the Republican Party. The Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation is a major donor to the Van Andel Institute.\Whitmer also vetoed a $35-million foundation allowance increase for charter schools, which are championed by both the DeVos family and many Republicans over traditional public schools.\""These are real cuts, real kids,"" said Dan Quisenberry, president of the Michigan Association of Public School Academies. About 150,000 children attend charter schools in Michigan, many of them in Detroit and other non-affluent areas, and ""kids are not tools to be used in a political negotiation,"" he said.\Republican legislative leaders have accused Whitmer of manufacturing an artificial crisis to back her demands for a 45-cent-per-gallon fuel tax increase that they say voters don't want.\The proposed gas tax hike was expected to raise about $2.5 billion annually, allowing an extra $1.9 billion a year in road spending while redirecting about $600 million in general fund spending now targeted at roads to other priorities such as education and the environment.\Whitmer said she vetoed 147 line items with a combined total of $947 million when she signed the 16 bills comprising the state's 2020 budget Monday.\Line-item vetoes earlier identified by Whitmer or her officials included the entire $37-million Pure Michigan campaign, $375 million in general fund money targeted for roads and more than $128 million in spending from the School Aid Fund, which supports K-12 education.\Also Tuesday, the State Administrative Board approved just over $600 million in fund transfers inside 13 different state departments. The shifts were requested by Whitmer as part of her efforts to reshape the budget.\Using the State Administrative Board to shift budget funds within state departments is a rarely used gubernatorial power. Former Republican Gov. John Engler was the first to use it in 1991 and the Michigan Supreme Court upheld the power in 1993, following a legal challenge from the Legislature.\Whitmer said she also declared ""unenforceable"" 72 different items of boilerplate in the budget sent to her by the Legislature. Boilerplate is generally budget language that directs how an agency should spend certain monies, or puts conditions on that spending. Whitmer said 72 such items either violated the state constitution or existing statutes.\As an example of budget ""pork,"" Whitmer cited a $1.5-million appropriation she vetoed for Florida-based Algebra Nation, which provides students and teachers with online and other resources to help learn and teach algebra. She said the company hosts some lawmakers at an annual ""swanky event"" in Florida.\A call to Algebra Nation was not immediately returned.\The Michigan League for Public Policy applauded Whitmer's actions as important steps toward finalizing the budget.\""She addressed one of the biggest concerns with the budget passed last week by directing $6.1 million in vital funding to support the implementation of Healthy Michigan Plan work requirements,"" and prevent losses in health coverage, said Michigan League for Public Policy CEO Gilda Jacobs.\""She also allotted $9 million in workforce development funding to help Healthy Michigan enrollees get the training they need to find and keep a job.""\CREDIT: Paul Egan"

Will the genius who approved the spraying of hot tar and loose gravel all over the roads in the Lansing area please make it stop?
\
Not only are you creating an unsightly mess that lasts for weeks, but the benefits of fixing roads in this manner are marginal, at best.

The Lansing-built Cadillac CTS is the MotorTrend car of the year. But who in their right mind would want to drive one on roads that are purposely being made worse?

Government responded
\
On. Aug. 21, I finally decided it was time to contact the road commission about a huge pothole on Milton Road at its intersection with Oakes Road, where we live in Shiawassee County.
\
Incorrectly, I assumed the pothole was the responsibility of Shiawassee County's Road Commission. A helpful person in that office enlightened me and went on to say that she would call the Ingham County Road Commission. That was about 8:30 a.m.
\
When we left home at 10 a.m., repair was just being finished! When I called the office, I learned that, yes, they had responded to the call and, no, it wasn't just a coincidence.

Let it go on the record that ""government"" does respond! And thank you.

Don't mandate on lawns
\
At its Aug. 12 meeting, the Williamstown Township Board agreed to explore adoption of the ""International Maintenance Code.""
\
This would set minimum standards for the upkeep of homes in the township. Trustee Robert Hayes repeatedly urged the board to add yard maintenance standards to any new code. There have been a few striking examples of poor home maintenance, and many residents would probably favor a means of improving that situation - although the cost of improvement is likely to be some large township attorney bills.
\
Yard maintenance is another matter. Some township residents have chosen to leave their property in a natural condition rather than consume the gas and apply the chemicals needed to produce a well-manicured suburban lawn. At a time of high energy prices and renewed concern for the environment, it seems like a bad idea to legislate the old suburban ideal of having a well-manicured lawn.

I just returned from a week's vacation in Pennsylvania. I drove through Ohio to get there
\
Here are a couple of observations I made during my trip:
\
Upon leaving Michigan and getting on the Ohio turnpike, I noticed that the gas was 15 cents cheaper than it was in Michigan. Then, leaving the Ohio turnpike and entering Pennsylvania - still on Interstate 80 and even off the beaten path - the price of gas there was another 10 to 15 cents cheaper than it was in Ohio. Hmm. That is 25 to 30 cents cheaper than in Michigan.
\
OK. I can see Ohio does not have as extreme changes in temperature that we have here, so maybe they do not have to have as high a gas tax. But Pennsylvania has the mountains and definitely has many more highways than we have here.
\
All this made me wonder why our gas is so pricey.
\
Also both states used a 65-mph speed limit. You can save a bit of gas at that speed.

Obama's callous to life
\
Rick Warren's recent interview with Sen. Barack Obama was revealing. Obama stated his concern for people whom Jesus referred to as ""the least of these."" In the Gospels, these are individuals who are ignored, victimized or not treated with full human dignity by others. I'm with you so far, Barack.
\
Minutes later, when asked his stance on abortion, he stated his support for it. Interesting
\
I think he forgot to disclose his support of partial-birth abortion throughout the entire nine months of pregnancy, though. Whoops.
\
He also failed to mention a proposed law that he blocked while in the Illinois Legislature. It would have required giving medical attention to infant girls and boys fortunate enough to survive late-term abortions. Currently, they are ""allowed"" to die. He blocked the legislation! ""The least of these""?
\
Sorry, Obama, I won't trust that kind of callousness with leadership.

Raise drinking age?
\
The LSJ's Aug. 24 editorial, ""Time to discuss a lower drinking age,"" had little support for its position.
\
The facts even seem to support the fact that binge drinking has little to do with legal age, since the highest rate of binge drinking was in the 21-25 age group.
\
Why not raise the legal drinking age to try to include this age group? The author's opinion seems to follow the misguided mentality of ""if everyone is breaking the law, then rescind the law so we can say that no one is breaking it anymore.""
\
If what's done now isn't working, try something more intelligent than lowering the legal age. The author already foresees problems with that solution too!

Pols do the 'whining'
\
Jack Smith (Letters, Aug. 21) stated that ""whining"" is the approach by many today in response to economic conditions. It is not what I hear from people. The first time I heard the term ""whining"" was from Phil Gramm, economic adviser to John McCain.
\
Gramm used the term ""whining"" to lessen the apparent impact of nationwide economic problems and thrust them back on the people impacted by those problems. The implication is that this is their own problem; not the economic problems created by the current administration.
\
A more apt description of the real world is that many people are facing ""dire"" economic times.
\
Smith also mentions the Great Depression and how folks today would handle those issues.
\
People in poverty in the 1930s had assistance from a sensitive administration, headed by FDR. He developed agencies that provided services to many segments of the economy.
\
His efforts gave people hope, optimism and evidence that the federal government cared about people's future. The current administration continues to favor upper class folks.

'Legacy' costly
\
Why should we let Dick Posthumus continue John Engler's ""legacy"" of intimidation, revenge, divisiveness, arrogance and deceptive accounting? They cut our property taxes, but raised fees for vehicle registration, hunting, camping, fishing, boating and parks. They raised the gas tax; created a new real-estate transfer tax; a car insurance rebate we're now paying back - plus two extra cents tax on every dollar we spend.
\
They fought higher unemployment benefits and living wages and cut funds for seniors and the mentally ill. When not brown-nosing in Washington, Engler was here, Posthumus at his side, stacking the courts, selling out our environment, and bashing unions, state employees and teachers.
\
They wasted our money on failed privatization contracts, an @$!81,000 for an ungrateful Doug Rothwell), and huge pay raises for themselves.

Vote for life
\
Jennifer Granholm has publicly stated she supports abortion through the ninth month - yet she tells us how much she cares for our children. There seems to be a real contradiction in her statements.
\
Granholm has been endorsed by Emily's List (a liberal organization that supports partial-birth abortion).
\
The American Medical Association has stated that it is against partial-birth abortion, deeming it a dangerous procedure. Therefore, when Granholm says she supports it to save the life of the mother, I would just ask that she check with the AMA.
\
If you have any doubts at all, please let the lives of these precious babies be the deciding factor. Vote pro-life. Vote Dick Posthumus.

\
Granholm thinks
\
Think back to when President John F. Kennedy ran for the presidency. The concern was the Catholic Church and the pope would be running the White House; that the separation of church and state would not be honored.
\
Now when a Catholic candidate wants to honor that division, she is criticized. Jennifer Granholm is pro-choice for others, even if that is not what she would choose for herself. If we want to be spiritual about choice, remember we should not judge others until we walk a mile in their shoes.
\
Dick Posthumus is anti-choice even in cases of the most grievous violations of a woman: rape and incest. Please elect the candidate that stands for all of us - Jennifer Granholm.

Oppose Granholm
\
Don't forget what attorney general fought hard to stop and negate your constitutional rights guaranteed under the Second Amendment. Instead of defending and enforcing the laws she was elected to do, Jennifer Granholm chose to fight against us - the people who elected her to do a job.
\
Now we are to believe she will defend our rights as the next governor? Well, I know I haven't forgotten and will vote with the other patriotic citizens of this state. I hope you are one of them, too. We must stop all invasions of our personal liberties before it is too late and we end up with no rights to enjoy - and no guns to defend them with.

Consider Granholm
\
I would like the readers to consider voting for Jennifer Granholm for governor.
\
As attorney general, she has shown her concern for people by her denouncement of handgun legislation enacted in this state; her willingness to pursue civil action against people who raised gasoline prices in response to terrorist acts committed against our country on Sept. 11; her continuing efforts to seek viable prescription drug price solutions for seniors; and her belief that women deserve the right to choice with respect to reproductive freedom.
\
Some recent campaign ads have alleged that she is ""too liberal."" After three terms of a conservative, Republican administration, anyone to the left of the status quo is probably considered too (fill in the blank) for their tastes.

Posthumus blasted
\
I find it ironic that Dick Posthumus speaks so much about ""Michigan values"" when he seems to be so devoid of them himself. He has run a campaign full of divisiveness, racial undertones and misrepresentations of the facts.
\
What kind of leader for Michigan could he be if he is so willing to pit people against one another and is so willing to take the low road to achieve his goal?
\
Michigan values are the same as those across this great nation and they are values of togetherness, hard work, caring and a determination to ""do the right thing."" These are values that Jennifer Granholm not only talks about, but also lives by.
\
Posthumus' actions and words speak volumes!

\
I don't understand how our religious leaders can preach to us about our basic religious values and then ask us to support candidates for public office who have stated positions against our basic beliefs, such as Jennifer Granholm. Either these are important or if not, they should stop talking about them forever.
\
I encourage all Catholics to vote our basic beliefs and help bring back basic morality to the United States and Michigan.

\
The International Carpenters & Millwrights Union has endorsed Dick Posthumus for governor.
\
These are just two examples of labor unions that can truly look beyond party affiliation and look for who will genuinely support Michigan's working families.

198,"Lawmakers look at landfill surcharge\CORRECTION\David Trendell, Anchor Recycling Inc. owner, sees a proposed bill in the state Legislature as a positive move. His feelings were misstated in a Page 1A photo caption Monday. 1/13/04 1B\By RYAN WERBECK\Times Herald\Blue plastic bins with empty cans, unwanted papers and used plastic containers line many Port Huron streets every week.\Jill Hurley, 29, dutifully fills hers without fail.\She has been recycling since moving to her home on Wall Street five years ago. Doing so helps protect the environment and future for her children, she said.\""I think it's very important,"" she said. ""My kids won't have a place to do anything or trees to play on.""\Under a bill being considered by state legislators, recycling programs such as Port Huron's and others in the area could see a boost in funding through a surcharge landfills would pay the state for every ton of waste left at their facility.\While lauded as a good idea, local officials see the move as unfair and potentially deadly to some recycling efforts.\""Ultimately, the customers are going to pay,"" said Larry O'Keefe, manager of the St. Clair County Landfill in Smiths Creek. It is the county's only landfill.\""It's like a gas tax on farmers,"" he said. ""They deliver their wheat, but it costs more, so the price of wheat goes up.""\The bill pending in the Legislature calls for a $3 per ton surcharge on solid waste from residential and commercial areas. A majority of that money then would be redistributed to local governments to help pay for recycling programs.\""People within the state who have to pay the surcharge should feel better that the money will go back to the communities,"" said Margaret Schulte, legislative director for Sen. Liz Brater, D-Ann Arbor, who sponsored the bill.\How the money would be distributed is among the sticking points legislators are trying to iron out in the bill, which is stalled in committee.\The benefit\Aside from promoting recycling, the bill is seen as a way of curbing out-of-state trash, a hot-button issue because the state is unable directly to ban hundreds of trash trucks coming from Canada each day bound for Michigan landfills.\Most of these trucks cross at the Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron.\Both of those goals appeal to David Trendell, owner of Anchor Recycling Inc. in Port Huron Township.\""We're doing our damnedest to keep things out of our landfills, and they're bringing everything over,"" he said. ""I think (the bill) would encourage recycling.""\Michigan needs encouraging when it comes to recycling.\The state has a 20% recycling rate. Other Great Lakes states average 26%, the Michigan Recycling Coalition said.\Money from the surcharge could boost that rate.\Cities, townships and villages operate 493 recycling programs, a majority of those in the state.\Port Huron's program has been around for about eight years.\State officials said the surcharge contained in the proposed bill would generate between $41 million and $51 million annually.\Not popular\The reasons behind the bill don't apply to St. Clair County, leading some to dispute its purpose.\""Right now, St. Clair County doesn't take any waste from Canada,"" O'Keefe said.

199,"The manufacturing employees in the Wayne County audience Thursday were concerned - about the loss of jobs, the movement of production overseas and the lack of support from Washington, D.C. in recent years.\Jim Zawacki, chairman of GR Spring & Stamping Inc., in Grand Rapids, told presumptive Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain of Arizona that while the concept of free trade is good, in practical terms, it's hurting his business.\""We've all testified before the trade commission about it,"" Zawacki, 65, said, adding later that ""free trade is hurting the United States because we don't enforce the rules.""\McCain, making his first trip to Michigan since a town hall meeting May 7, said he sympathized with employers but added that now is not the time for isolationism.\""When I see unfair trade practices, we'll act very quickly and effectively,"" he said. ""But I also have to look you straight in the eye and tell you that I do believe in free trade.""\McCain met with about 250 undecided voters, small-business owners and auto industry employees Thursday at the Bayloff Stamped Products in Van Buren Township. He's expected back in Michigan next Thursday for events on the west side of the state.\McCain, who was joined by his wife, Cindy, spent just more than an hour talking to the invited guests, mostly about pocketbook issues facing both individuals and businesses.\""I don't know if I'll get everyone's vote in this room,"" he said. ""But I can assure you that if I become president, I will represent everybody in this room.""\It wasn't a given that McCain would get all the votes in the room.\A wary voter\Rich Keenan, 48, of Canton said he would never vote for Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. But he also was wary of McCain's vote against tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush and the environment.\""We want to take you to the dance, but we're just concerned about who you're going to go home with,"" Keenan told McCain. ""I'm trying to put myself in a position where I'm excited about voting for you.""\McCain, often described as a maverick in the U.S. Senate, said he is proud of his record and doesn't regret the votes that are giving Keenan pause.\""When we enacted those tax cuts, there was no restraint in spending,"" he said. ""We may disagree from time to time on specific issues, but I'll always put my country first.""\McCain also talked about the need for energy-saving technology, lower taxes and better education. He also spoke about the country's overreliance on foreign oil, saying that Obama was offering no clear-cut solutions to the energy crisis facing the country.\""He's Dr. No on energy. He's against nuclear power and offshore drilling,"" McCain said during a news conference after the event. ""He doesn't understand the energy needs or national security needs of this country.""\Plans for auto industry\He touted his plans to help the domestic auto industry by making research and development tax credits permanent and providing a $300-million reward to the company that could develop the first commercially available electric or battery-powered automobile.\In a news conference before the event, Wayne County Executive Robert Ficano, a Democrat, called the reward a gimmick that was an insult to southeast Michigan companies that have been working for years on such technology with little or no help from the federal government.\But McCain said the program is meant to stimulate competition. ""The same people who are criticizing this are the same ones who say we shouldn't have a gas-tax holiday.""\The holiday would provide some much-needed relief to individuals who are struggling to make ends meet every day, especially in states like Michigan where the economic downturn has hit particularly hard, McCain said. But that solution has been dismissed by most economists and has faced a dismal reaction in Washington.\That's part of the problem, McCain said.\""We're gridlocked in our nation's Capitol. We're doing nothing except fighting with one another,"" McCain said, noting that a recent poll showed approval ratings of Congress had plummeted to just 9%. When McCain asked the audience whether anyone considered themselves part of that 9%, no one raised their hand.\Little mention of Bush\McCain repeatedly invoked the name of Republican hero President Ronald Reagan, but kept clear of President George W. Bush, who also has dismal approval ratings.\While there was only one question about national security, McCain did highlight his military service and said he's the best one to deal with foreign adversaries.\""I'm very worried about Iran. For the second time, they've tested another missile,"" he said. ""Sen. Obama wants to sit down with no preconditions. ... But we need to join with our European allies to impose the strictest kinds of sanctions against them.""\By the end of the discussion, Keenan said he was closer to a vote for McCain.\""He's an honorable man, and I have respect for him,"" he said. ""I'm not completely sure, but I'm a lot closer than I was at noon.""\Contact KATHLEEN GRAY at 313-223-4407 or kgray99@freepress.com.\ILLUSTRATION: Photo\CAPTION: Sen.

As this debate goes forward, every senator must be asked if the energy proposals they support truly fulfill the ""sense of urgency this challenge requires.""\We cannot afford another energy bill like we've had in the past -- weakened, lobbyist-crafted collections of half-measures like those passed in 2005 and 2007.

It is far beyond time to make reliable public transportation the main means of travel within our communities.\Euni Rose\Southfield\Don't stop drilling\I am urging the reinstatement of all offshore production and drilling now. While the Deepwater Horizon incident is a catastrophe, it is no reason to cause further economic problems and damage by shutting down that critical sector of our economy.\When you consider the number of producing offshore oil and gas wells that have been drilled and completed without incident, there is no reason to shut down the entire industry due to this isolated incident.\Ron Carr\Redford\A disaster coming to the UP?\In the wake of the BP oil disaster, I would not expect anything other than critical thoughtfulness in response to corporate negligence and consumer behaviors. At the moment, however, a sacred site is soon going to be drilled into by mining giant Kennecott/Rio Tinto, using sulfide mining practices to extract nickel and other ores.\Not only have First Nation sovereignty and treaty rights been dismissed, but the empirically proven environmental disasters this project will create have also been ignored. Despite federal EPA agents wanting to proceed extremely cautiously, the Legislature, governor and Department of Natural Resources officials somehow feel that expediting the process behooves the economic interests of the state.\As with BP, we need to say enough is enough, and demand accountability from corporations and elected officials.\Andrew Plisner\Detroit\Do it ourselves\Something my father said to me years ago seems pertinent today in light of the disaster unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico. He said: ""If you want something done right, do it yourself.""\Many people doubt that BP has the resources to make right the damage to our waters, the wildlife they support, or the economy of the region it affects. I hope they are wrong, but the lesson there might best be reinforced by what my father meant.\If we are going to continue to allow drilling for oil off our shores, at least we ought to award contracts to American companies with a vested interest and accountability for our environment and its future.\James D. Gohl\Dearborn\Use royalties wisely\The federal government takes in millions of dollars from leases and royalty payments, as well as the federal gas tax. If the feds would stop comingling this revenue with general revenue or set aside some, perhaps there would be enough money to hire enough inspectors.\In addition, in response to a June 13 letter to the editor (""Spare the Arctic""), to compare a well 5,000 feet deep to one at the surface, where the current infrastructure exists and is proven over time, shows the writer's obvious bias. The people who live in the Alaska National Wildlife Reserve want drilling, have seen previous results, and have little to no objection to drilling.\Kevin M. Scane\Farmington\Stop finger-pointing\Much has been said about the gulf oil spill and, of course, there has to be a villain in the matter. President Obama and many others have assigned that part to British Petroleum. Yet neither Obama, the politicians nor the media have proved that it is something BP did or did not do to cause this spill.\Can anyone really think BP is not making every effort known to stop the leak? It should be remembered that one of the big losers in this matter is BP -- and that it is in its best interest to stop the leak as soon as possible.\For Obama and others to point fingers at BP is counterproductive. It has created a split between the U.S. and England and its people. It is time to act as grownups whose first duty is to work together to stem the flow of oil. Frank Mannino\Warren\Put unemployed to work\I would like to know why people who have received unemployment checks are not being used to clean up the oil mess. Where are the community organizers? If you pay people for not working, why should they?\Zelda Rose\Farmington Hills\Beyond mistakes\Kentucky Republican Senate candidate Rand Paul's casual dismissal of BP's irresponsible hand in ecological disaster -- ""corporations make mistakes,"" and the emerging cue that CEOs should not shoulder the blame for decisions that have bad consequences -- raises red flags for what is yet to come in dealing with irresponsible, conflicted regulators, a Congress leveraged by lobbyist money, and CEOs who put the bottom line and personal profit ahead of people and the national interest.\Mankind's imperfection is quickly becoming a substitute for ""accountability"" much in the same way that ""I made a mistake"" is a legal defense for bad conduct.\Legitimate mistakes can be framed by actions of innocent intent but should never be confused or equated with calculated efforts of wrongdoing, where the only mistake made is in the thought of never being caught.\Joseph Borrajo\Dearborn"

Detroit News Lansing Bureau
\
Lansing -- Michigan voters would support
\
efforts to eliminate chronic government budget deficits partly through cuts to public employee compensation and pooling health care, according to a Detroit News poll
\
.
\
The results also found the mood of Michiganians remains relatively gloomy, but has improved significantly since the November election.
\
Just 35 percent of voters said they believe the state is on the right track
\
. However, that's up from only 21 percent with a favorable outlook in August.
\
The poll of 600 registered voters statewide measured feelings on top issues facing the state as legislators prepare to return to the Capitol on Wednesday and Gov. Rick Snyder was sworn in
\
this past weekend.
\
A majority voiced support for changes in pay for public employees that are expected to be part of the agenda for a Republican governor whose party controls both chambers of the Legislature. Among the findings:
\
52 percent
\
support a 5 percent cut in total compensation for state employees, while 39 percent are opposed. Snyder has made no such specific proposal.
\
A proposal to pool state and local government employee health care -- a plan backed by Snyder's treasurer, Andy Dillon, when he was Democratic House Speaker -- gets a thumbs-up from voters by 59 percent to 33 percent.
\
By 68 percent to 28 percent, voters support changing teacher tenure rules to base it on student performance rather than the number of years a teacher has been on the job. Even 56 percent of union households supported the change, which Snyder has said needs to be looked at.
\
On making Michigan a ""right-to-work"" state, which Snyder has said is not part of his immediate agenda, 55 percent favor the change while 38 percent are opposed.
\
On taxes, 66 percent of those polled say cuts to business taxes will help create jobs in Michigan. But voters are much less convinced about Snyder's plan for a 6 percent corporate income tax to replace the Michigan Business Tax with 38 percent supporting the idea and 39 percent opposed.
\
The telephone poll
\
was commissioned by The News and WDIV Local 4 and conducted Sunday through Tuesday
\
by Glengariff Group Inc. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
\
""I found the results to be encouraging, because they show people are ready for bold change,"" said House Speaker Jase Bolger, R-Marshall, who attributes the improving mood to the Nov. 2 election results.
\
""People do not want us to continue business as usual
\
.""
\
House Minority Leader Richard Hammel, D-Mount Morris Township, said he is ""OK with changes in contracts and pay and benefit cuts as long as they are negotiated at the table,"" and not imposed by legislation.
\
The budget deficit is projected at $1.85 billion for the fiscal year that starts in October. Snyder has pledged to balance the budget without hiking taxes.
\
Goodwill for governor
\
Snyder
\
starts work with plenty of goodwill, with 52 percent saying they have a favorable impression of the new governor and only 12 percent saying they have a negative impression.
\
Even Democrats are more positive than negative about Snyder, by 30 percent to 21 percent, while 72 percent of Republicans and 50 percent of independents have a favorable impression.
\
Though he's called it one of the most difficult issues he will face as governor because it affects workers and their families, Snyder has said a major issue for him is a long-term fix to what he views as excessive total compensation paid to public employees at the state, local government and school district levels.
\
The poll results are consistent with the message he got from voters during the election, Snyder said through his spokeswoman, Geralyn Lasher. ""They want their elected leaders to get the state's fiscal house in order and create an environment where jobs can grow,"" she said.
\
Snyder said during the campaign that state employees have endured unpaid furlough days and requirements that they put more of their pay toward health care and retirement costs. A long-term solution based on what is affordable and comparable to the private sector would be more fair than nickel and diming them with more cuts each year, he said.
\
Ray Holman, legislative liaison for UAW Local 6000, which represents about 17,000 state employees, said state workers have allowed changes that will save taxpayers millions for generations, such as reduced benefits for new employees and moving new employees to a less costly pension plan in about 1997.
\
The state's structural budget deficit is largely the result of years of business tax cuts and ""if they cut our salaries by 50 percent and took away our health insurance, we'd still have a chronic deficit problem,"" Holman said.
\
Two parties, two viewpoints
\
Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer, D- East Lansing, said she agrees ""there's got to be an over-arching policy goal of getting rid of the gimmicks and games and one-time fixes
\
."" But, ""you can't balance the budget on one group of people's backs.""
\
Senate Majority Leader Randy Richardville, R-Monroe, said ""there's going to be pain and there's going to be sacrifice"" for the long-term good of the state.
\
Since winning the election, Snyder has said pay reform at the local and school district level may be more pressing than for the state, whose employees have already had cuts to compensation.
\
The poll showed big differences on the pay issues between Republicans and Democrats and between voters in union and non-union households.
\
On the state employee pay cut, for example, 66 percent of Republicans were in favor but only 36 percent of Democrats.
\
On right to work, under which employees would be able to choose whether to join or financially support a union at their workplace, 64 percent of nonunion households supported the change while a still significant 34 percent of voters in union households said they were in favor.
\
Voters said they were overwhelmingly opposed to a gas tax increase of 8 cents per gallon over two years to raise $1 billion to fix Michigan's roads. Only 28 percent support the tax hike; with 69 percent opposed.

"
202,"DON'T FRET if you heard that Ford Motor Co. is rethinking the wisdom of\selling Excursions, Expeditions, Navigators and other sport-utility vehicles\because they're large and pollute more than cars.\As long as you want to buy them, Ford will continue to build them.\""If our customers want to drive tanks, we'll give them tanks,"" William Clay\Ford Jr., the automaker's chairman, said Monday. ""But, in as socially\responsible a fashion as possible.""\In the 12 days since Ford released the first of what will be annual corporate\responsibility reports, an uproar has engulfed the company's chairman.\A front-page story in the New York Times under the headline ""Ford Is Conceding\S.U.V. Drawbacks"" implied that the automaker, under the guidance of its\chairman, had switched sides, joining environmentalists and other opponents of\the large and popular trucks.\Editorialists, industry experts, investors and even his own employees wondered\whether Ford was taking a swipe at his own jugular. After all, a huge chunk of\the automaker's profit comes from sport-utility sales.\Brock Yates, a columnist for Car & Driver and notorious curmudgeon, wrote an\essay in the Wall Street Journal, characterizing Bill Ford as ""another\guilt-ridden rich kid, not a proud tycoon like those who preceded him.""\Like many others, I've admired the energy, brains and freshness of Ford's\chairman. But upon reading reaction to Ford's report, I was one of those who\thought: Uh, oh. Stepped in it this time.\Had Bill Ford -- a relatively youthful, newly minted leader -- placed a higher\priority on a cleaner, safer planet than his company's mere financial success?\Had his well-documented environmental sympathies overwhelmed his business\judgment?\No, Ford said in an interview Monday, where he sought to set the record\straight. He isn't ashamed of, or apologizing for, the automaker's successful\line of sport-utilities.\The company is taking a greater responsibility for the environment than ever\before. However, those efforts won't be allowed to undermine Ford's results\for shareholders and customers.\Indeed, a poll Ford commissioned after release of the 98-page corporate\citizenship report showed that those who had heard about it gave the company\high marks.\Ford said the frank discussion of corporate citizenship wasn't intended to\score public relations points, noting that it was distributed without fanfare.\""The further we get from it"" -- the release of the report -- ""the better it's\playing,"" he said. ""My only disappointment in the response to our report is\that a small section was lifted to make it sound as though we were criticizing\our own products. That's not the case. We were just trying to make the issues\more transparent.""\As for Yates' barbs in the Wall Street Journal: ""He just doesn't get it,"" Ford\said.\What distinguished Ford's corporate citizenship report from others of its kind\was how frankly the company acknowledged critics and their ability to shape\regulation and other factors affecting its future. The report actually quotes\from a Sierra Club news release calling ""the gas-guzzling SUV"" a ""rolling\monument to environmental destruction.""\Ford doesn't give credence to the Sierra Club's assertion -- but it also\doesn't rebut the statement. ""The whole report is meant to say 'here are\things we're doing well, here are issues, here are what critics say and here's\what we're doing to address them,' "" he said. ""We've got nothing to hide. A\great company, I think, is one in which nothing is hidden.""\Despite attacks from environmentalists -- and he considers himself one --\Ford's own wife uses a mammoth Lincoln Navigator sport-utility (as well as a\Volvo station wagon) to shuttle the couple's four children around.\""I'm proud of her,"" he said.\Ford's report comes as environmental critics are pushing hard to raise fuel\efficiency, emissions, safety and other standards on vehicles. Ford research\on fuel efficiency and safety, for example, shows that consumers want better\mileage for their vehicles but won't accept less comfort, convenience or\performance to get it.\""The challenge is to make them cleaner and more efficient but do it in a way\that the customer can't detect,"" he said. ""Society wants cleaner vehicles but\won't accept tradeoffs.""\For sport-utilities, which enjoy less stringent rules than conventional cars,\tighter regulations could spell dislocation, if not doom. So why play into the\hands of sport-utilities' opponents?\""Quite the opposite,"" Ford countered. ""We gain credibility with our critics.\It lets us sit at the table with them, without them criticizing us for being\perpetually recalcitrant.""\The Sierra Club will be mistaken by assuming that Ford plans to ease up in the\fuel-efficiency debate in Washington. ""CAFE,"" or corporate average fuel\economy standards, ""isn't an effective way to pursue the goal of saving\energy,"" Ford said. ""We're on record as being in favor of a higher gas tax,""\to discourage consumption, though he acknowledged that chance of passage is\slim.\""We're not on the side of raising CAFE,"" he said. Environmentalists generally\favor raising the CAFE standard on trucks, vans and sport-utilities so they\would be equal to that of cars. Stricter federal air pollution standards\covering large vehicles are set to take effect in nine years.\The strategy of acknowledging critics -- without necessarily taking their side\-- is meant to defuse suspicions that Ford and other corporations are abusing\their power.\""Large global corporations are going to be held accountable for their behavior\and their openness,"" Ford said. By publishing a report on itself,\acknowledging criticism and speaking candidly, he contends his company may\assuage ""poorly defined opposition to globalism.""\I think Bill Ford is dead on. Companies such as Ford hold more power for\social harm and good than all but a handful of the world's countries.\The automaker's corporate report card, like that of General Motors released\last year, for the first time discloses so-called ""environmental metrics,""\such as the amount of nonrecyclable material and energy used to make its\products. It's a good move.\Remember: It wasn't all that long ago that executives in this town said that\seat belts were a bad idea. The Ford flap shows that some executives\understand the need to respond to the public more urgently than ever.\Contact DORON LEVIN at 313-223-4390 or levin@freepress.com.\ILLUSTRATION: Photo JOHN COLLIER/Detroit Free Press\CAPTION: William Clay Ford Jr. defends his SUV comments Monday.\DISCLAIMER: THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION MAY DIFFER SLIGHTLY FROM THE PRINTED ARTICLE."

204,"When voters resoundingly rejected a road proposal that would have altered the gas tax and preserved dollars for schools and transit, most folks interpreted it as a sharp message from voters to state lawmakers: Go back to work, and do better this time.\So far, they haven't.\But now, Lansing insiders say, they're close. Really close. Legislative leaders -- Senate Majority leader Arlan Meekhof, R-West Olive, Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich, D-Flint, House Speaker Kevin Cotter, R-Mt. Pleasant and House Minority Leader Tim Griemel, R-Auburn Hills, along with Lt. Gov. Brian Calley -- are meeting, or at least talking, every day, and a deal could be ready by next week, or next month.\Financially, it's impossible to scrounge the additional $1.2 billion a year Michigan needs to fix its roads from existing funds -- not if you want a functional state government. It requires a tax increase.\Politically, it's impossible to pass a tax increase that's not paired with spending cuts.\And if you're trying to build consensus between two parties, that's a problem.\Folks close to the negotiation say the deal now under discussion splits the required $1.2 billion into $800 million in new revenue, and $400 million in cuts to the state's general fund budget. Still up in the air: how exactly the new revenue would be generated -- likely a combination of increased gas taxes and registration fees -- and what programs would be cut.\And, as painful and prolonged as this process is, it's the easy part.\For a road deal to become more than a tentative agreement, a majority of lawmakers has to approve it. In the Senate, that's 38 votes; in the House, it's 54.\And that's complicated. The GOP holds a majority in both chambers -- that's 61 seats in the House. But because at least 11 members of the House have signed an anti-tax pledge, Republican leaders can't count on reaching a majority vote from their own caucus for a deal that includes a tax increase. On the other end are Democrats, who say the roads package can't include cuts to schools and other essential services.\""Trying to get the caucuses to follow along is a problem,"" said John Truscott, a public relations executive who served in the administration of former Gov. John Engler, a Republican. ""People are going to have to show some courage. It seems like a simple solution, and it shouldn't be that difficult. But in today's political environment, it's very, very difficult thing to get things done.""\The Senate, insiders say, is a lower bar to clear because its members are viewed as more amenable to compromise. It's the House that's tricky.\So how can legislative leaders sell a deal with cuts and new taxes -- each anathema to one party?\""Nobody knows what that roadmap looks like yet,"" Truscott said.\Getting there\Veteran lawmakers tell a story about Engler: When he wanted to line up votes, and both reason and milder forms of persuasion had failed, he'd call wayward legislators to his office. There would be Engler ... and someone else. That person, Engler would say, would be the legislator's well-funded opponent in the next primary, with the full weight of the governor's endorsement. And the legislator would fall in line.\Maybe apocryphal, that story hits on something important: There are carrots, and then there are sticks.\And in this fight, there are precious few of either.\Gov. Rick Snyder doesn't politick like Engler. But neither has he made good on the tactics he told the Free Press he'd use to line up legislative consensus. Snyder campaigned on his lack of political savvy, but told the Free Press in 2010 that he'd appeal directly to voters when lawmakers weren't cooperating. If a lawmaker wouldn't vote yes on a critical matter, Snyder said he'd up the pressure by holding town halls on the issue in that legislator's district. That hasn't happened. Despite his support for a roads deal, Snyder has remained largely hands-off.\Further, some folks close to the negotiations say, Snyder -- Calley has acted as the governor's representative in the talks -- has encouraged lawmakers to consider the roads deal on its merits, and not as fodder for dealmaking.\Nor, said state government veteran Maxine Berman, is Snyder the kind of governor to exercise the line-item veto -- which can deny lawmakers important projects in their home districts -- as a form of coercion.\Which isn't to say next year's election, in which every member of the House of Representatives is term-limited or up for re-election, doesn't figure into the equation. (No state Senate seats are up until 2018.)\For lawmakers seeking re-election, it's a good idea to get a deal done now. That it hasn't thus far is a black eye for the Legislature, and to enter an election year with the matter still unresolved offers prospective opponents a too-convenient avenue for attack.\But for anti-tax lawmakers, passing a tax increase before an election year is also problematic, particularly if the lawmaker anticipates a primary challenge.\Meanwhile, across the aisle\For Democrats, it's a different question.\Because anti-tax Republicans are so staunchly against tax increases, legislative leaders must court Democratic representatives.\But what can Republican leaders credibly offer, that could convince Dems to get on board?\To reach $400 million in cuts means harm to some essential programs, said Berman, who served in the Michigan House of Representatives from 1983 to 1996, was a staffer in Gov. Jennifer Granholm's administration and also has held an endowed chair in American government at Central Michigan University.\""That's a lot of money,"" Berman said. ""We're looking at serious cuts in K-12 education, to revenue sharing, to the extent that statutory revenue sharing exists anymore ... this is going to have a significant impact.""\It's unlikely that Republican leaders would roll back business tax cuts, take the proposed repeal of prevailing wage off the table, or any of the other causes Democratic reps might move for.\""There has to be some kind of horsetrading,"" Berman said. ""I'm just not sure if they can find a big enough horse right now to pick up Democratic votes.""\A light at the end of the tunnel?\And yet, most folks in Lansing seem optimistic that something will happen, and soon. Negotiations continue, and no one wants to start election-year campaigning with roads outstanding.\Constituent pressure will help convince lawmakers to act, Truscott says.\Berman concurs.\""I think one thing legislators, of whatever party they're in, have to do more of is really go to their constituents and explain this problem,"" she said. ""They all know the roads are horrible, but they really believe there is another way to fund it. ... I don't think people understand how much it costs to do this.""\And Snyder has to play a larger role.\""I'm not trying to put the whole onus on the governor's office, but that's where the maturity is, the people who have been around for 40 years and understand this,"" Berman said. ""They should be working to protect the budget.""\But whatever happens, the legislative road ahead -- much like Michigan's roads -- is anything but smooth.\Contact Nancy Kaffer: nkaffer@freepress.com\Nancy Kaffer"
205,"LANSING – Gov. Gretchen Whitmer defended her extraordinary use of line-item vetoes to slash close to $1 billion from the 2020 state budget at a news conference Tuesday and called on Republican leaders to meet with her Thursday to restart negotiations on the spending plan.\""I know there are things they care about in this budget that are no longer a reality,"" Whitmer said.\""We have an opportunity to negotiate things back into the budget if the Legislature avails themselves of that opportunity.""\Whitmer, a Democrat, also defended many of the cuts as what she said were examples of pork barrel spending inserted into the budget by Republican lawmakers and said she had to make ""hard decisions"" to protect public health and safety.\""I do not relish using these powers, but they were absolutely necessary because the budgets they sent were fatally flawed,"" she said.\On eliminating the Pure Michigan tourism promotion campaign, for example, Whitmer said: ""I love Pure Michigan,"" and ""I think it's a fantastic ad campaign.""\But she said other Republican cuts, such as ones to the Corrections Department, had endangered public safety, and in attempting to reshape the budget, ""I'm always going to put public safety ... ahead of an ad campaign.""\She acknowledged there is a risk that Republican lawmakers will allow the cuts to stand, rather than negotiate a new budget deal.\""If they do that, it's going to be on them,"" she said.\Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, said he's in ""no rush"" to address the vetoes.\""There is no amount of red pen usage that will result in enough green buttons pushed in the Senate to get my governor what she wants,"" Shirkey said.\Other controversial funding vetoes include $38 million in higher education tuition grants, $10 million for ""secure schools,"" $1.6 million for ""strict discipline academies,"" and $600,000 for traffic control at the Michigan International Speedway.\Some of the cuts resulting from vetoes appeared targeted at rural areas that tend to elect Republican lawmakers. Those include $13.1 million for secondary road patrols, $16.6 million for rural hospitals, and close to $8 million to pay for rural obstetricians. Whitmer also vetoed tens of millions of dollars in rate increases for hospitals, pediatric psychiatrists, neonatologists, and private duty nurses.\""The elimination of funding for hospitals further exacerbates the financial burden on Michigan hospitals, primarily those that are small or rural, and threatens access to care in our most vulnerable communities,"" said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health and Hospital Association.\And in a fund transfer, Whitmer moved money allocated for the Van Andel Institute, a biomedical research and science education organization in Grand Rapids, and shifted it to help Healthy Michigan plan enrollees meet state work requirements that were put into law by the GOP Legislature. Jay Van Andel founded Amway with Rich DeVos, whose family is a huge bankroller of the Republican Party. The Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation is a major donor to the Van Andel Institute.\Whitmer also vetoed a $35-million foundation allowance increase for charter schools, which are championed by both the DeVos family and many Republicans over traditional public schools.\""These are real cuts, real kids,"" said Dan Quisenberry, president of the Michigan Association of Public School Academies. About 150,000 children attend charter schools in Michigan, many of them in Detroit and other non-affluent areas, and ""kids are not tools to be used in a political negotiation,"" he said.\Republican legislative leaders have accused Whitmer of manufacturing an artificial crisis to back her demands for a 45-cent-per-gallon fuel tax increase that they say voters don't want.\The proposed gas tax hike was expected to raise about $2.5 billion annually, allowing an extra $1.9 billion a year in road spending while redirecting about $600 million in general fund spending now targeted at roads to other priorities such as education and the environment.\Whitmer said she vetoed 147 line items with a combined total of $947 million when she signed the 16 bills comprising the state's 2020 budget Monday.\Line-item vetoes earlier identified by Whitmer or her officials included the entire $37-million Pure Michigan campaign, $375 million in general fund money targeted for roads and more than $128 million in spending from the School Aid Fund, which supports K-12 education.\Also Tuesday, the State Administrative Board approved just over $600 million in fund transfers inside 13 different state departments. The shifts were requested by Whitmer as part of her efforts to reshape the budget.\Using the State Administrative Board to shift budget funds within state departments is a rarely used gubernatorial power. Former Republican Gov. John Engler was the first to use it in 1991 and the Michigan Supreme Court upheld the power in 1993, following a legal challenge from the Legislature.\Whitmer said she also declared ""unenforceable"" 72 different items of boilerplate in the budget sent to her by the Legislature. Boilerplate is generally budget language that directs how an agency should spend certain monies, or puts conditions on that spending. Whitmer said 72 such items either violated the state constitution or existing statutes.\As an example of budget ""pork,"" Whitmer cited a $1.5-million appropriation she vetoed for Florida-based Algebra Nation, which provides students and teachers with online and other resources to help learn and teach algebra. She said the company hosts some lawmakers at an annual ""swanky event"" in Florida.\A call to Algebra Nation was not immediately returned.\The Michigan League for Public Policy applauded Whitmer's actions as important steps toward finalizing the budget.\""She addressed one of the biggest concerns with the budget passed last week by directing $6.1 million in vital funding to support the implementation of Healthy Michigan Plan work requirements,"" and prevent losses in health coverage, said Michigan League for Public Policy CEO Gilda Jacobs.\""She also allotted $9 million in workforce development funding to help Healthy Michigan enrollees get the training they need to find and keep a job.""\Michigan Gov.

206,"
DEARBORN -- General Motors Corp. Chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner said Washington should not slack off on efforts to develop alternative energy sources now that oil prices have fallen.
\
Wagoner pressed the issue during a speech Tuesday night at the Automotive News World Congress in Dearborn, where fuel economy and energy policy were hot topics.
\
""With the price of oil at its lowest level in 19 months, we run the risk of reverting back to our traditional energy policy,"" Wagoner said. ""That is, relying heavily on the lowest-cost energy available on world markets, including imported oil, without providing adequate support for developing alternative sources.
\
""I hope oil prices stay low, but I also hope that our nation stays committed to energy security through energy diversity.""
\
Wagoner's comments came after the University of Michigan had earlier in the day released a study showing auto executives and other experts believe gasoline prices and government fuel economy standards will increase dramatically in the next decade.
\
Also Tuesday at the annual industry event, an outspoken auto supplier executive called for imposing a steep tax on gasoline to help fund the transition to alternative energy sources, especially hydrogen.
\
Focusing on fuel
\
Wagoner has made alternative fuel a focal point for GM in recent months. At the North American International Auto Show, GM is showing off a concept plug-in hybrid called the Chevrolet Volt that can travel 40 miles on battery power.
\
The CEOs of Detroit's Big Three automakers have been pushing the Bush administration to help with efforts to develop alternative fuels such as ethanol-based E85 and biodiesel. The automakers also want federal help in developing batteries sufficient to power vehicles.
\
Wagoner, along with Ford Motor Co. CEO Alan Mulally and Tom LaSorda, CEO of DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler Group, met with Bush in November and pushed him on alternative energy, although they came away with no promises.
\
Last June, the three CEOs said they would double their production of alternative fuel vehicles by 2010.
\
The Bush administration, meanwhile, has sought authority to raise fuel economy requirements for passenger cars. The Big Three have strongly opposed efforts by some in Congress to mandate a fuel economy requirement.
\
""One of the things that government... has to do to really promote energy diversity is proactively support the development of alternative fuel technology,"" Wagoner said. ""And incentivize consumers through tax credits, fuel subsidies and so on to adopt these exciting new technologies.""
\
While oil prices have been moderating, and gas prices along with them, a new survey released Tuesday by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute predicted that fuel prices and fuel economy standards will rise substantially in coming years.
\
Gas prices will average slightly more than $4 a gallon by 2015 and just over $5 a gallon by 2020, according to the survey of automakers, suppliers and other experts.
\
The study also found that Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for cars are expected to increase to 33 mpg in 2015 and 38 mpg in 2020, a 38 percent jump from today's 27.5 mpg standard. For trucks, CAFE standards are expected to rise to 27 mpg in 2015 and 31 mpg in 2020, a 44 percent increase from 21.6 mpg today.
\
""Our research reveals surprising agreement among all stakeholders in the automobile industry that fuel prices are on a steep upward trajectory,"" said U-M researcher Bruce Belzowski.
\
Supplier speaks out
\
Touching on many of the same topics Tuesday was Tim Leuliette, chairman and CEO of Plymouth-based auto parts supplier Metaldyne Corp. He has been outspoken on the issue of shifting the nation away from its dependence on oil. In a speech at the world congress, he called for a dramatic increase in the federal gasoline tax, saying the move was needed to fund the nation's transition to a hydrogen economy.
\
He pointed out that drivers in the United States pay 30 percent to 40 percent of what motorists in other industrialized countries pay at the pump. He advocated raising U.S. gas prices to match those in other developed nations, where consumers pay $5 or more a gallon.
\
""Gasoline is too cheap in America,"" Leuliette said.
\
""When fuel prices are low, there is little interest on Wall Street, Main Street or 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.""
\
A dramatic hike in gas prices would not only put this issue at the forefront of the national agenda, but provide the cash needed to fund the development of hydrogen fuel cell technology and a hydrogen infrastructure.
\
He said the federal government has only committed $1.2 billion to fund hydrogen fuel research and development for the next five years -- a figure he said was $800,000 less than it spends in one week on the war in Iraq. His proposed tax on gasoline would rise and fall with oil prices to guarantee stability at the pump and allow automakers to better meet consumer needs.
\
Other auto industry executives reacted coolly to Leuliette's proposal, but agreed that more needs to be done to develop hydrogen and other alternative powertrain technologies.
\
""If we're ever going to get there, we better start. That much I agree with,"" said Don Altermatt, senior manager of diesel engineering for DaimlerChrysler AG.
\
However, Altermatt said clean diesel is a far more promising near-term option.
\
National policy needed
\
""Is there a need for a national energy policy? Absolutely,"" said Nancy Gioia, director of sustainable mobility technologies and hybrid vehicle programs at Ford. ""We have not got the kind of collaboration yet that we need.""
\
While Ford favors a broad approach to new propulsion technologies, Gioia told The Detroit News that hydrogen is one of the most promising long-term solutions -- one that she said will require a national commitment comparable to the one required to put a man on the moon.
\
At the same time, Gioia pointed out that hydrogen is not a panacea. She said it takes a great deal of energy to extract hydrogen -- energy that might be better utilized by other technologies like plug-in hybrids.
\
Leuliette has called for a gas tax to fund hydrogen research and development in the past, though never one of this magnitude.
\
But the veteran auto industry executive said America's dependence on petroleum is a threat to national security, the environment and the economy, and one the nation is running out of time to address.
\
Leuliette also acknowledged that his proposal would be a hard sell in Washington, but he said it will be a lot harder to develop a national energy policy in the midst of an energy crisis.
\
""If Nigeria falls, if there is an Iranian crisis, if Venezuela goes off the deep end and we stand in line again for fuel, then it will happen in (a) nanosecond,"" he told The News. ""The longer we wait, the harder the transformation will be -- and the more it will cost.""
\
Moreover, he said the switch from gasoline to hydrogen would also jumpstart the domestic auto industry and revive Detroit.

208,"LANSING – The $61.9-billion state budget proposal for 2021 seeks to improve education, job training and public health, while trying to ensure a cleaner environment for Michigan residents, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Thursday.\The budget also gives new life to the Pure Michigan tourism promotion and branding campaign, though on a reduced scale that seeks additional funding from private tourism operators.\""Our future depends on making strong investments in these core priorities, and while we cannot correct decades of underfunding overnight, particularly in the areas of education, this budget builds on last year's budget to provide additional funding in these critical areas,"" Whitmer said.\State Budget Director Chris Kolb presented the proposed 2021 budget to state lawmakers Thursday. It's Whitmer's second budget. He cited a flat general fund budget over the last 20 years that is facing a ""perfect storm"" of increasing spending pressures, including $600million allocated to road repairs this year.\The budget made no provision for repeal of the state tax on pension income. Getting rid of that tax was a key Whitmer campaign promise in 2018.\Whitmer said that despite ongoing budget challenges, her plan ""maximizes our resources and invests in programs and policies that will have a positive impact.""\The total proposed budget figure, which includes federal funding, marks a 3.9% increase from 2020, while the proposed $11 billion general fund — the state's main checking account — represents a 5.8% increase. School Aid Fund spending of $15.9 billion would mark a 4.9% increase, officials said.\Under a new statutory deadline, the Republican-controlled Legislature must now present its budget plan to Whitmer by July 1.\Reaction from key Republican lawmakers was guarded, but mostly neutral or positive.\""We're just starting to digest this,"" said Rep. Shane Hernandez, R-Port Huron, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee ""We look at the total number at $61.9 billion and I think there's a lot we need to look at to see how we're getting to that number.""\The budget calls for $15 million for Pure Michigan.

Detroit News Washington Bureau
\
In applying to be Michigan's next governor, Pete Hoekstra has changed car oil in Sturgis, scooped ice cream in Byron Center, sold lettuce at the Hillsdale farmers' market and helped rebuild a sewer line in Detroit.
\
The Republican congressman and former businessman is more than halfway through his pledge to do 100 jobs across the state to show he'd be a governor who listens and understands.
\
""He wasn't messing around,"" says John Mikulenas, owner of Tuffy Auto Service Center in Sturgis. ""He got right in and did an oil change and a tune-up. And he listened to my concerns. I felt he really wanted to get the pulse of what's going on in Michigan.""
\
Hoekstra -- pronounced Hook-stra -- impressed Mikulenas as anything but a cookie-cutter politician, and may get his vote in the Aug. 3 primary.
\
The ""100 jobs"" idea is vintage Hoekstra: Since his first successful run for Congress in 1992, the former marketing vice president at Herman Miller has used savvy salesmanship to get voters to see what he has to offer.
\
""Having experience in the political and the business worlds pretty much uniquely qualifies me for the job,"" says Hoekstra, 56, a top contender in most polls.
\
If elected governor, he vows to create a business-friendly climate by cutting taxes, regulation and the size of state government.
\
""I hear over and over and over again from people who have wanted to invest and grow jobs in the state, and the bureaucracy has come up with some reason to say, 'No,' "" he says.Saying Michigan's next governor must have the skills to work with both parties in the Legislature, Hoekstra cites his track record of working smoothly with such Democrats as U.S. Rep. Jane Harman of California on intelligence matters.
\
""I can go into Lansing and create an atmosphere to facilitate getting things done,"" he says.
\
On education, he'd push for state tax credits for parents and push Congress to let Michigan opt out of federal No Child Left Behind mandates.
\
He says he'd fight to get the state a better rate of return on gas taxes to fund more road repairs. After 18 years representing a district with 200 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline, he promises to fight to clean up the Great Lakes and keep out invasive species.
\
And he'd seek to repeal the federal health care overhaul, which he believes will overwhelm the state budget and Michigan businesses.
\
Immigrant, state roots
\
He insists on being called Pete and sleeps on a couch in his Capitol Hill office as a reminder that his home is in Michigan. He's kept close to his Dutch roots, snacking on salty black Dutch licorice and putting a ""Welkom"" sign on his office door.
\
As the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, he's a familiar face on national TV news talk shows, boosting his name recognition beyond the western side of the state.
\
Hoekstra's roots to Michigan date to the mid-1950s, when he arrived at age 3 from the Netherlands, not speaking a word of English, with two siblings and his parents, bakers hungry for the American dream after the suffering of World War II.
\
The Hoekstra household was full of political debate, which Andy Hoekstra credits for his younger brother's love of politics.
\
After college, Pete Hoekstra was hired at Zeeland-based Herman Miller, where his boss and mentor, Philip Mercorella, says he quickly stood out.
\
""People always tended to underestimate him because he was very modest and a nice guy. He was the surprise guy,"" Mercorella says. ""He goes into everything with huge energy. He really did his homework.""
\
Hoekstra was known as an astute listener, who sought diverse ideas before committing to a plan.
\
""Pete thrived in the environment of problem solving,"" Mercorella recalls. But Hoekstra stunned colleagues by challenging Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, a 13-term incumbent and power player. Hoekstra believed Vander Jagt had lost touch.
\
""It was really important to Pete to give it a shot,"" wife Diane recalls. ""He really thought voters deserved a better congressman.""
\
Intelligence focus
\
Hoekstra became a lieutenant of Newt Gingrich, who crafted the Contract for America and led Republicans to control of the House after the 1994 elections.
\
""He was very aggressively driven by a desire to be a reformer,"" recalls the ex-House speaker, who has endorsed Hoekstra. ""He was clearly one of the most effective ideas-oriented members.""
\
In 1997, Hoekstra, then chairing the oversight and investigations subcommittee, launched a probe into the fraud-ridden 1996 Teamsters' election of Ron Carey as president. Hoekstra won praise for exposing wrongdoing and overseeing a rerun that led to the election of James P. Hoffa.
\
The Teamsters returned the favor in 2000 by endorsing Hoekstra, despite his largely anti-labor voting record. And last week, the Michigan Teamsters endorsed him.
\
The solid relationship he developed with Teamsters, he says now, would help him as governor of a heavily unionized state.
\
In the late 1990s, he was part of the House Republican team that produced balanced budgets four years in a row.
\
Hoekstra developed a reputation as a maverick, opposing President George W. Bush on No Child Left Behind, for example.
\
In 2008, he voted for the $700 billion bank bailout and for the $14 billion rescue of General Motors and Chrysler. In 2009, he voted against the $787 billion stimulus bill, and in March opposed the health care overhaul.
\
His biggest legislative accomplishment was a 2004 bill that revamped the nation's intelligence system in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
\
But he has had a few high-profile spats, such as when the White House accused him of hypocrisy for gushing to constituents about a ""very generous"" home-buying incentive in the stimulus bill, which he opposed.
\
CEO of Michigan
\
Underscoring his commitment to be a governor who listens, Hoekstra came up with the ""Idea Bus"" that he drives around the state, asking voters for their ideas. He's halfway through a pledge to bike 1,000 miles around Michigan to meet voters.
\
His believes his economic plan -- including scrapping the Michigan business tax and the personal property tax, while expanding the sales tax -- would ""get government out of the way"" so businesses can create jobs.
\
""The overall impact would be people in Michigan would be paying less in taxes,"" he says.
\
Charles Ballard, an economist at Michigan State University, likes Hoekstra's idea to get rid of the MBT, but says a net reduction in taxes would be a mistake.
\
David Littmann, senior economist at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, dismisses Hoekstra's plan as ""more of the same"" without enough specifics.
\
But Hoekstra is banking on his ideas and those he gathers to turn the state around. ""If we create a great economic climate, I am ready to be surprised by who is going to do extremely well.""

The expansion is expected to help 5,900 children.\For Michigan's 46,000 state employees, the budget calls for 12 weeks of paid parental leave upon the birth or adoption of a child, Kolb told lawmakers. Currently, employees who want 12 weeks of parental leave would have to rely in part on unpaid leave. The estimated cost of the change is $10 million.\Whitmer's proposed budget also includes these items:\Cuts to state department totaling $178 million, identified by state department directors at Kolb's request.\For the Michigan State Police, funding for 120 new troopers, bringing total trooper numbers to just under 2,000.\$12.3 million to expand the response to the opioid crisis.\$86.5 million to double the number of physicians in medical residency programs in rural and medically underserved areas.\A $2.1-billion Corrections Department budget, including $132.7 million allocated for ""offender success"" programs, intended to help keep people out of prison.\An extra $30 million for transit and rail programs, plus $30 million extra for airport improvements.\$1 million to improve access to contraceptive services.\To commemorate former Michigan Gov. William Milliken, who died in October, the budget calls for $2.5 million for a Milliken Visitor Center, to be built near Arch Rock on Mackinac Island.\Sen. Jim Stamas, R-Midland, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said a positive item in the budget is the additional money for rural health care.\Whitmer was criticized during her veto fight with the Legislature late last year because of her veto cuts impacted rural communities, which are mostly represented by Republican lawmakers.\""The director talked a lot about a substantial cut in some of the departments and I'm anxious to see where those cuts are,"" Stamas said.\Contact Paul Egan: 517-372-8660 or pegan@freepress.com.

Patterson paves the way for Automation Alley
\
By John H. Manor
\
Oakland County's reputation as an economic powerhouse has captured the attention of business strategists across the nation. A stroll through it's busy development department will attest to just how many companies want to make Oakland County their new home.
\
The county boasts the highest per-capita income in Michigan and the third highest in the nation. This didn't happen just by accident, it's all part of a master plan.
\
L. Brooks Patterson, Oakland County executive for the past 16 years, has created an environment in which to operate a business.
\
We recently sat down with Patterson to see just what has put the motion in Automation Alley and where he sees the county, state and region going in the 21st century.
\
CHRONICLE: What will Automation Alley mean to the future of Oakland County?
\
PATTERSON: Over that past two decades we have established a number of high-tech business clusters in Oakland County. Along with growth in this industry, we realized that there is and would continue to be a need for skilled employees and executivelevel candidates to fill positions within these high-tech companies. Demand for this type of talent is very high and the competition for these workers is great, so I knew we were going to have to come up with some solution to address this need in Oakland County.
\
I have always understood and realized the value of a good marketing plan when it comes to business. We simply applied the idea to marketing our technology-based businesses in this county to the rest of the nation.
\
In Oakland County we have a cluster of tech-based corporations to rival and compete directly with California's Silicon Valley and Boston's Route 128. We stack up against and, in most cases, far and away surpass what our competing regions have to offer potential high-tech businesses. It will be my future mission to continue to roll out this marketing plan and bring the national recognition to Oakland County that Automation Alley is due.
\
CHRONICLE: Has the competition between Oakland, Wayne and Macomb counties for new business heated up or are you still focusing your efforts on other national competition?
\
PATTERSON: I don't believe that Wayne or Macomb counties are our competitors. They are more our allies in this region. We root for Wayne County to attract new business. It can only help us as a region. If Wayne does well our economy improves. It helps us attract new residents and additional business as well to Oakland County. It is a win-win for the region.
\
I still hold true to the fact that we still compete with the other regions in the nation, and even the world that seek to garner the same businesses and companies that Oakland County attracts. Places like Texas, Atlanta, California are our competitors. They are growing and bringing in business.
\
CHRONICLE: You took part in the regional cooperation that worked to clean up Lake St. Clair. Do you feel Oakland County got a fair shake in this deal?
\
PATTERSON: Sometimes we get the blame pointed at us too often but I concede that along with many other communities along the river, Oakland County does contribute to some of the pollution in Lake St. Clair. Because we are, we want to be part of the solution to clean it up. We are spending already $139 million in Phase One of the cleanup and will be spending millions more over time to ensure that we are not a polluter. An environmental problem like Lake St. Clair will take additional time and money to completely solve. We want to be a good neighbor and do our part and I think we are doing just that.
\
CHRONICLE: Another year has passed and southeastern Michigan is still without a comprehensive regional transit system. In your opinion, what seems to be the hold-up and will it take an act of God-or governor-to see any resolution on this issue?
\
PATTERSON: We have a regional system; it's called SMART. It works and has been getting rave revues from the people who utilize the system to get back and forth to work. The SMART bus system is growing and ridership has continued to grow. We are currently picking up more than 15,000 riders daily out of Detroit to jobs in the suburbs. So I disagree when you say that we don't have a regional system. We do.
\
Now, do we have one monolithic system? No. There are many major metropolitan areas, like D.C., Chicago and New York, that have numerous bus systems working alongside one another. So, why are we pushing so hard for this here? Big is not necessarily better. Certainly not when it comes to forcing a merger between DDOT and SMART.
\
The DDOT is a failed system that requires a $60 million subsidy from Detroit each year. The SMART system runs in the black with ever-increasing ridership. I would be remiss as a public official if I bent to the will of some people and agreed to merge the two systems and spread the cost out evenly over Oakland County. My taxpayers would rightfully recall me from office.
\
CHRONICLE: Two years ago, you really were one of the first political leaders to step forward and demand that dollars be made available to improve our state and public roadways. Are you pleased with the progress being made today?
\
PATTERSON: We have the busiest expressway in Michigan cutting right through Oakland County, I-75. It handles more than 220,000 cars a day and it needs desperately to be expanded. We need additional on and off ramps to help alleviate traffic, as well as additional lanes. Currently, the Michigan Department of Transportation is looking to see what kind of improvements are needed. I anticipate that motorists would be happy to part with the cost and greenspace needed to accommodate this improvement.
\
Exit 89 all the way to 14 Mile Road desperately needs to be expanded, maybe even to I-696. We need to stop spending money where few motorists utilize the roadways and begin to focus more of our attention to where the bulk of the state drives daily. If you only have a limited supply of money, then you need to spend it where the majority of the problems with congestion are occurring.
\
I spoke with the governor a month ago and raised the idea of a local gas tax to be utilized solely for the needs of road repair and expansion. I am going to be moving on that issue this year to create through legislation the option at the local level for a community such as Oakland County to tax up to two cents at the pump for local roads. That would raise about $14 million we could spend on our roads. It would take voter approval, but I think Oakland would agree that it is time to make our roads less congested and cut down on our drive time each day.
\
CHRONICLE: How have you viewed the sweeping changes taking place in the Detroit Public Schools system? Did the governor make the right decision in seizing control?
\
PATTERSON: Without a doubt. The former Detroit Public School Board had been given enough opportunities to demonstrate that they could turn the system around and it was always ""we can do it later, or we have a 12-point program we are announcing next month."" I think the governor finally did what he had to do to salvage a floundering system. There were just too many kids getting lost in the cracks and that was just unacceptable.
\
We need to have kids graduate with employable skills and the former DPS wasn't getting the job done and hadn't been for quite a while. We have $50,000 a-year jobs available here that we can't fill with any viable job pool to draw from.
\
CHRONICLE: Would Detroit's falling below the million mark in the pending Census 2000 have an affect on Oakland?
\
PATTERSON: Absolutely yes. If Detroit drops below one million, they stand to lose tens of millions of dollars from their already strapped city budget. What happens if Detroit loses $170 million because it drops below a million residents? Some of the money they can make up themselves but the bulk will have to come from elsewhere. And that means going to Lansing for help.
\
Most likely Lansing will help cover as much as they can. And where do you think Lansing is going to get that money? From the taxpayers in all the other counties in Michigan. So, I view it as being crucial that Detroit stay above a million residents. And I honestly believe that the city will reach the million mark.
\
CHRONICLE: Were you disappointed by Compuware's commitment to move its headquarters to Detroit?
\
PATTERSON: Well, I think it is a win for the region in keeping Compuware here but at a loss to Farmington Hills. It is a big win for Detroit, without a doubt, but really a non-issue for Oakland County other than maybe ego and bragging rights. We have 40,400 businesses and six Fortune 500 companies headquartered here. And as much as I hate to see even one business leave Oakland, it won't kill us.
\
The move to Detroit, if it does happen, will improve and enhance the image of the city.

214,"Oil and gas prices are skyrocketing for one simple reason: because they can! Who is there to stop them? Our president and his father are good friends with the Saudi royal family, yet prices keep going up. Both the president and his father are oil men. They wouldn't put their interests and the interests of their friends above the welfare of the American public, would they?\Now there's plenty of oil in Iraq. We've spent trillions of dollars and thousands of lives over there. Why aren't we benefiting?\As Americans, I see only three ways to deal with this situation:\* Become wealthy.\* Change the government. First, each politician, including and especially the president, should have to swear that they will hold the welfare and interests of the American people above all else, including any special interest groups. Second, it should be required by law that the president should have to answer questions from a small group of randomly picked Americans. It would be interesting to see real Americans press the president on the effects of these dramatic price increases, or hear him tell combat veterans how he honors their service but won't spend what amounts to funding the war for a few days to upgrade the antiquated GI Bill so that a returning veteran can at least get a four-year degree from a state college.\* Just put up with it.\-- Patrick Gilligan Jr.\Madison Heights\Coupons for tourists\To encourage tourism this summer, the State of Michigan should give each touring motorist $25 in gasoline coupons. The coupons should be given to motorists at least 100 miles from the state in which their car is registered, good only for gasoline, valid for two weeks.\The give-away should be advertised widely. Of course, measures must be taken to minimize cheating; there should be a database of coupons issued.\-- Harley Flanders\Ann Arbor\Build smarter cars\Instead of complaining about high gas prices and asking for more drilling, why not complain about having to drive cars that run on gas? What we should be driving are cars that run on hydrogen fuel cells. These cars should be charged by solar panels on your roof that charge a power station. The car should be constructed with a carbon fiber body as well.\The solar power to charge the vehicle will keep us from burning nasty coal, and it will make the vehicle an electrical vehicle that only spews water vapor out of the tailpipe, instead of the pollution a car normally puts out. The carbon fiber body will make the vehicle much lighter and stronger. Another bonus of the carbon fiber body would be that you could assemble the parts together by hand without the use of robots, thus creating more jobs. Just think how much easier an electrical vehicle is to maintain with it not having a gas engine to deal with as well.\Get with it, auto companies, and get us off this bad gas habit.\-- William Mackinnon\Rochester Hills\Let market work\I disagree with David Abromowitz's idea that a tax credit be given to purchasers of fuel-efficient cars (""A break on fuel-efficient cars, not gas tax, needed,"" May 23).\This is just bad policy. It gives more of a credit to those making less, feeding the entitlement mentality and class envy of those with lower incomes. It artificially increases demand for vehicles, which will cause a spike in sales followed by a deep valley, rather than a more flat line of production. Most important, it will not achieve Abromowitz's goal of long-term fuel-use consumption reduction.\There will be no less use of gas. With better mileage, drivers will just drive more until they have exhausted their fuel budget, rather than keep mileage constant and use less gas.\The market is already solving the problem. People are canceling vacations, Oakland County may go to a work schedule of four days of 10 hours, companies are offering more telecommuting, etc. There is no need for me and other taxpayers to supply $10 billion in welfare for a solution that has no chance of working.\The only result will be subsidized new cars for 1 million lucky consumers and a windfall for the companies and workers that supply the cars.\There are no miracles. We need to adjust to the new reality of fuel prices.\-- Carman Conforti\Chesterfield Township\A workable suggestion\I read David Abromowitz's column and felt optimistic for the first time in a long while. In the midst of all this posturing and pandering by everyone involved - politicians and car company execs, specifically - here is a suggestion that had a ring of possibility to it: sensible, immediate, doable. Is anyone listening?\-- Mary DeVita\Shelby Township\Begging for oil\So this is what our energy policy has come to. George W. Bush, president of the United States and self-proclaimed oil man extraordinaire, presenting himself before the Saudi king, with hat in hand and on bended knee, groveling for a few spare barrels of oil. What a spectacle.\-- Chris Kuebler\Birmingham\Big Oil greed\Greed! That's what these high gas prices are all about. When is enough, enough? Why isn't our government doing anything about it?\-- S. C. Wheeler\St. Clair Shores\Change is coming\I understand how one can think that tapping our oil reserves or drilling in the Gulf might ease the price of gas, but do you really think the oil companies would offer that oil to the United States when they can get what the rest of the world is willing to pay? Come on, people, wise up.\The only way that might work is if the federal government ran the whole thing, using U.S. troops - oh, wait, all those troops with oil field experience are in Iraq. And we have this little thing called ""free market"" capitalism to deal with.\But when all else fails, just remember that the last eight years are almost over; Bush's oil buddies have all feathered their nests, and maybe change is coming.\-- Richard Kotulak\Shelby Township\Real savings in biofuels\In spite of your May 22 article ""Corn grown for ethanol feeds feud over food,"" those of us who know of the comprehensive benefits ethanol offers our nation are confident of its bright future. There is no defensible reason for Detroit's automakers to abandon biofuels. Renewable fuels remain our brightest tangible hope for ensuring a greater level of home-grown energy security for our nation.\Less than 10% of the U.S. corn crop is used for corn-based foods consumed by humans. Today, farmers receive a cash corn price of around $5.50 a bushel, while the value of corn in each box of corn flakes averages 7.9 cents. When corn flakes cost approximately $3.30 for an 18-ounce box, that translates into the farmer receiving just 2% of the retail price.\On the fuel side of the ledger, our nation's renewable fuels standard lowers our current gas prices by as much as 15%, saving consumers roughly 50 cents a gallon. The production of 6.5 billion gallons of ethanol in 2007 displaced the need for 228 million barrels of oil. That is equivalent to nearly half of the oil imported from Venezuela in 2007.\Experts never said ethanol would replace petroleum, but it is important and brings us one step closer to cellulosic biofuel, and that means even greater energy security for our nation.\-- Bob Stallman\President\American Farm Bureau Federation\Washington, D.C.\Immoral use of food\The May 22 illustration regarding corn to ethanol to fuel tank was almost perfect. Instead of a shopper pulling on one end and an automobile at the other, a starving child with an empty bowl on the one end would have been even better.\While the use of corn for making ethanol for our fuel tanks is not the only reason for the tremendous increase in the price of most of our food, it is a major reason. Using almost a third of our corn crop to put in our fuel tanks while food is becoming almost unaffordable for many of us, but unavailable for many of the poorest in our world, is plainly and simply immoral.\-- Sigrid Dale\Warren\Switch to reel mowers\With high fuel prices coinciding with the receipt of our economic stimulus checks, it appears that most of the stimulus will be going to the fuel companies. Of course, we have the option to drive less, and we should.\However, with the lawn-mowing season now upon us, many of us will also be consuming fuel with our mowers. Gas mowers are inefficient fuel users and emit a great deal of air pollution. Fortunately, the old-fashioned, non-gas, reel mowers still exist and are quite effective. Brand new ones are relatively inexpensive compared to gas mowers, and used reel mowers usually cost next to nothing.\Before the fuel companies drain your entire stimulus check, please consider the purchase of a nonpolluting reel mower. In the long run, your pocketbook, your health, and the environment will thank you.\-- Ryan Shadbolt\West Bloomfield\Try gas rationing\Having survived eight decades of life and having seen much, I suggest that rationing of gas might work to relieve the high price of fuel. Gas was rationed during World War II to ensure that our troops would have fuel to fight the war.\To ration a system that gives a person 90% of what the need is would create a surplus of fuel, causing the system of supply and demand to kick in. Too much supply and the suppliers would lower prices to gain the business, thus causing a lower price to kick in. In the meantime we could allow drilling for oil offshore and other places where we know oil lays. If we wait for alternate fuels to become common, we will be walking - walking in a system that will be broken.\-- Frank Mannino\Warren\ILLUSTRATION: Drawing GARY VARVEL Indianapolis Star;Drawing JIM BORGMAN Cincinnati Enquirer\MEMO: ON POINT.\DISCLAIMER: THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION MAY DIFFER SLIGHTLY FROM THE PRINTED ARTICLE"

Engler's farewell
\
3-term governor reshaped schools, taxes, welfare, politics in Michigan
\
""I'm very excited that we're getting out of here. We've had a good 12 years."" Gov. John Engler
\
By Chris Andrews
\
Lansing State Journal
\
After 11 years, 11 months, and 28 days, Gov. John Engler isn't done yet.
\
Michigan's three-term governor pressured the state Senate to return for a rare Dec. 30 session to pass a charter schools bill he wants to sign before he leaves office at noon Wednesday.
\
Engler's perseverance is a fitting end to an era in which he pushed to reshape schools, taxes, welfare - and the political landscape.
\
""There's nobody that's been like him,"" said Bill Ballenger, editor of the newsletter Inside Michigan Politics. ""Engler was just a force of nature when it came to asserting his will and his persistence and his patience.""
\
His policies - and will - have been felt by all 10 million Michigan residents.
\
Thousands of students attend charter schools that exist only because of Engler's relentless support of them.
\
Residents pay lower property taxes but higher taxes on everything from books to cars.
\
The welfare rolls were cut by two-thirds. The 5.7 percent unemployment rate is below the 6 percent national average - something that hadn't happened for decades before Engler.
\
Whether he wins the battle over charter schools or not, his place seems secure as one of Michigan's most dominant political figures.
\
His opponents are counting the days - four - until Democratic Attorney General Jennifer Granholm takes over. They begrudgingly acknowledge Engler's success in advancing a conservative agenda they say benefited businesses and the wealthy.
\
""The tax breaks were really shifts that fell as a greater burden on the worker,"" said Mark Gaffney, president of the Michigan AFL-CIO. ""Workers who needed workers' compensation found it harder to qualify, workers who needed unemployment found for many years it didn't keep pace with rising costs.""
\
While there is debate over the merit of his policies, there's no question he had a major impact on Michigan.
\
Engler won the 1990 election by a scant 17,594 votes, upsetting Democratic Gov. James Blanchard.
\
On Inauguration Day, former Gov. George Romney offered simple advice: ""Be bold.""
\
Engler didn't need to be told twice.
\
Faced with a potential budget deficit, he laid off more than 2,000 employees and cut spending in welfare and the arts, prompting protests and a failed recall.
\
What Engler couldn't get from the Legislature, he often got through executive orders or other administrative powers rarely used by governors before him.
\
""He demonstrated what a governor can do ... given the broad powers granted to that office,"" said Dan Pero, Engler's former chief of staff. ""He was not only aware of how to do it, but he was not shy about doing it.""
\
Former state worker Robert Alexander of East Lansing said Engler wasn't shy about slashing services for everyone from at-risk kids to people in nursing homes.
\
""He was an unmitigated disaster,"" said Alexander, a volunteer in Granholm's transition office. ""He doesn't care if services are unavailable to low-income and middle-income families.""
\
Tax relief
\
The centerpiece of the Engler legacy: Proposal A. The 1994 constitutional amendment overhauled public school funding and gave homeowners tax relief.
\
It assured Engler's re-election.
\
He pledged during his 1990 campaign to cut property taxes. But voters turned down two proposals, and halfway through his third year, he hadn't delivered.
\
When Senate Democrats pushed a measure to end school property taxes entirely, many Republicans, including Engler, saw it as political grandstanding. But Republicans approved it, and Engler signed it.
\
That set the stage for months of negotiations and a plan to cut taxes and reduce funding gaps between school districts. Voters passed Proposal A, raising the sales tax. They rejected the alternative - higher income tax.
\
""What the governor did is put all the chips on his version of the proposal passing and bet everything on it,"" said John Truscott, Engler's press secretary then. ""Without a doubt it was a gamble, but it was very calculated.""
\
Welfare reform
\
Another early and sustained focus for Engler: Welfare reform. As part of his work to balance the budget in 1991, he eliminated general assistance welfare, serving 82,000 childless adults.
\
So protesters built a tent city on the Capitol lawn. The tents eventually went down. And so did the welfare rolls.
\
""I've often likened his decision to end general assistance welfare to Ronald Reagan's firing of the air traffic controllers,"" said Larry Reed of the Mackinac Center, a Midland think tank. ""It sent a message and created a new tone and a new direction for welfare policy.""
\
Engler later pushed new work requirements for welfare recipients, while letting them keep more of the money they earned. Michigan became a model for other states, and Engler became a key player in national welfare reform negotiations.
\
Critics say Engler missed opportunities during the boom times of the 1990s to provide education and training to move people to higher-paying jobs.
\
Now, the economy has weakened and the basic Family Independence Program grant for a family of three is $459 a month - the same as when he started.
\
""I don't think there's any question that the safety net in Michigan is weaker,"" said Sharon Parks of the Michigan League for Human Services. ""We're ... hoping for a kinder, gentler Michigan.""
\
Big impact
\
Engler's impact is felt in a multitude of other ways.
\
He counted tax cuts like Baskin Robbins counts ice cream flavors - 31 in his 12 years. He raised taxes on retail sales, cigarettes and gas.
\
""John Engler should be credited for creating an economic environment that encouraged business to invest and made it much easier to attract employees,"" said James Barrett, president of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce.
\
Opponents say the cuts mostly helped business and the rich, and contribute to the roughly $1.5 billion budget shortfall for 2003-04.
\
Engler took a tough-on-crime approach that included a new punk prison for youths, longer sentences for criminals and a revamped parole board reluctant to let prisoners go.
\
He reorganized departments, splitting the Department of Natural Resources into the DNR and the Department of Environmental Quality. That pleased business and outraged environmental groups.
\
Politics changed
\
While Engler was reshaping state government, he also was changing the political landscape.
\
Until his election in 1990, Republicans' only foothold in state government was the Senate where he was majority leader.
\
While Democrat Jennifer Granholm succeeds Engler, Republicans hold solid majorities in the state House, Senate and Supreme Court and the secretary of state and attorney general will both be Republicans.
\
""He really did lead the resurgence of the party in Michigan,"" said Rusty Hills, chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. ""He spent the time, he recruited good candidates, supported them and helped the party grow.""
\
While his legacy is substantial, there are things undone.
\
Engler never got the broad Friend of the Court reform he wanted, and he was stymied in letting universities sponsor more charter schools statewide.
\
And despite promises to leave the state in better fiscal shape than he found it, the state is awash in red ink. Financial experts say the budget shortfall for 2003-04 is $1.5 billion. Granholm will have to plug the holes, much like Engler did 12 years ago.
\
""The numbers keep getting more and more disturbing,"" she said. ""It is much more serious than any of us on the campaign imagined.""
\
Engler said her problems are manageable, if she's willing to make tough choices like he did.
\
""I'm very excited that we're getting out of here,"" he said Friday at his last news conference. ""We've had a good 12 years.""

216,"I am both fortune and proud as a father to have Ayanna (Jones) Neal as my daughter, what a life blessing...thanks God. Ayanna would be an asset to any organization, a take-charge person, with a broad range of skills, technical knowledge, specialization, and work experiences; she is considered a dependable, energetic and enthusiastic hard-working legal professional that performs at a very high level and she would be an excellent judge for the Lansing community.\Thomas Jones\Lansing\I am supporting Cynthia Ward for 54-A District Court judge. First, Cynthia's background includes a degree in economics and political science from Rutgers University and a law degree from Villanova Law School. Second, Cynthia has provided free legal assistance to the homeless. Finally, as a former director of Lansing's Department of Parks and Recreation, I was impressed with Cynthia's service as a Lansing Park Board member (June 2007-July 2010) as we renovated many parks including Frances, Burchard, and Wainwright parks. Cynthia has proven her commitment to our community and she will continue to work hard as our District Court judge.\Murdock Jemerson\Lansing\Beyond a doubt, Angela Witwer is one of the most qualified people to run for the state representative position for the 71st District in years. Angela has given sincere dedication as a mother, community leader, and businesswoman. In all she does, Angela exemplifies honesty, fairness, and thoughtfulness. Angela will use these qualities when partnering with Eaton County farmers to help them prosper as they work tirelessly to feed our community. We need Angela. Angela needs you. Vote for her on Nov. 6.\Holly Schaeffer\Charlotte\Elissa Slotkin is an outstanding candidate for Congress. She has not only served in Iraq and worked in National Security, she is also strongly motivated to work in a bipartisan manner to find practical solutions to a variety of problems. Equally impressive is the fact that she has an intense commitment to connect with the people of this district, and has worked tirelessly to do so, not only to share her views, but to listen to our views and needs, and answer our questions. I have seldom seen so highly qualified and motivated a candidate. Let's make her our representative.\Susan MacFadden\Holt\I am writing to express my support for Angela Witwer in her efforts to be elected for state representative of the 71st district. Witwer is an active presence on the Waverly School Board. The hands-on approach allows her to stay in tune with the activities of the students, faculty and administration and aids Angela in her ability to be an active advocate. Her wealth of experience and dedication to the Waverly School District is awe inspiring. She conducts herself with grace and dignity that should be an inspiration for us all. My fellow voters, please join me in casting your vote for Angela Witwer as our state representative for the 71st District.\Matt Oppenheim\Grand Ledge\Christine Barnes is the top pick for the 71st state House District. A proven leader who is accessible, realistic, willing to work across party lines, and in touch with the values and priorities of the voters in her district. Vote #TeamBarnes!\April Stopczynski\Charlotte\I am writing to support Angela Witwer for state representative of the 71st District. Witwer is an active presence on the Waverly School Board.

Her wealth of experience and dedication to the Waverly School District is awe inspiring. She conducts herself with grace and dignity that should be an inspiration for us all. Please join me in casting your vote for Angela Witwer as our state representative for the 71st district.\Matt Oppenheim\Grand Ledge\Christine Barnes is the best choice for Eaton County state representative for the 71st District. She grew up in Eaton County and is Grand Ledge High Class of '87. Christine has been an excellent county commissioner. Every once in a while someone comes along who really cares. That person is Christine!\Anne Jones\Mulliken\With Election Day upon us, we have an opportunity to make a change. I am a recent college graduate with an understanding of this fierce political climate and as a millennial in our county this is my call-to-action to vote for Angela Witwer for state representative of the 71 District on Nov. 6. As a bipartisan political advocate she is above party politics and focuses on the people and what the voters want. Angela Witwer will help our generation prosper and lead us into a sustainable future for generations to come.\Chelsea Fraley\Lansing\The Lansing State Journal's endorsement of Gretchen Driskell demonstrates it only cares about liberal ideology, not results. Rep. Tim Walberg passed more bipartisan legislation than any Michigan member this Congress, because he can work together and achieve results. He passed bills to combat the drug addiction epidemic, protect victims of human trafficking and the list goes on. Gretchen Driskell served four years as a legislator in Lansing and failed to ever pass a bill or even an amendment to a bill. Driskell will claim it's because she's a Democrat, but 96 percent of Democrat legislators passed something.\Darlene Littlejohn\Charlotte\As owners of a small farm in Ingham County, we support the 'Farmland and Open Space Preservation Initiative.' This program preserves forever the use of land for production of food and fiber in addition to providing environmental benefits for climate and wildlife. Landowners receive a one-time payment determined by a third-party appraisal firm; and continue to pay property taxes. The protected land will never become a built development and will continue to be used for production of food and fiber in addition to providing environmental enhancement. The millage request is a small 0.14 mills. Passage will protect open space and benefit future generations forever.\Gerald and Martha Schwab\Holt\In today's bitter environment of tribal politics it is important to support candidates who put people above party. That's why I endorse Angela Witwer's candidacy for state representative of the 71st District. Ms. Witwer is a longtime resident of the district with a history of community service, as well as a proven ability to build coalitions and solve problems. Additionally, as a first-time candidate for office, she is no political hack beholden to special interest groups. The people of the 71st District are fortunate to have such an able candidate and will be well-served if she is elected.\John Lux\Lansing\Lansing legislator Gretchen Driskell skipped many votes in Lansing so she could be in Washington D.C. to raise money for her congressional campaign. Driskell had the choice each of those times to represent her constituents by doing her job or skipping work to try to get Nancy Pelosi to give her congressional campaign money. Her priorities clear, and on the money front, it worked out for Driskell, because Nancy Pelosi's political operations have spent more than $600,000 to elect Gretchen Driskell to Congress. Shame on the LSJ for endorsing such a shameless, self-serving politician in Gretchen Driskell.\Dairus Reynnet\Dimondale\Get the facts — vote 'Yes' on Proposal 2. Claim: No limits on commission spending. Fact: Proposal states the maximum amount to be budgeted, to be used only in the years required to set voting districts; commission meets only during those years.\Claim: The current system is fair. Fact: Michigan, 50 percent Republican and 50 percent Democrat, has nine Republicans, five Democrats in the US Congress; 27 Republicans, 11 Democrats in the Michigan Senate, 63 Republicans, 47 Democrats in the Michigan House.\Claim: Commissioners are ""unqualified."" Fact: Experts will help draw the districts to be fair, impartial, transparent; process open to the public.\Elizabeth Hutchinson\Haslett\Christine Barnes is the right choice for state representative, District 71. Christine has been an excellent county commissioner, helping all the people in her district and posting information about her district and the county on Facebook. She is fair and honest and very involved with community activities. Her work ethic is impressive. Christine is a thoughtful fiscal conservative. She feels confident that we can have good roads without additional taxes; her opponent has stated publicly that the gas tax should be raised by 25 cents per gallon. Vote Nov. 6 for Christine Barnes. She won't let you down.\Darlene Littlejohn\Charlotte\Integrity and accountability are buzzwords we always hear in campaign promises, yet we often see nothing of those promises once the elections are done. I think this is a trend that is becoming increasingly common, but doesn't need to continue. We have the power to vote for someone who has 22 years of experience as a business owner and active member on a variety of community boards, I believe Angela Witwer will be a reliable state representative for the 71st District. Please join me in voting Angela Witwer for state representative on Nov. 6.\Jane Whitacre\Lansing\This election has been extremely competitive for many candidates. As Nov. 6 approaches, decisions need to be made which benefit all of us.\I've been helping candidates across the state and have witnessed hard-working candidates. Christine Barnes is one of those candidates. Her tenacity and exceptional work ethic is something I'm confident she will bring to Lansing.\If you're looking for someone who works hard, will fight relentlessly, and be resilient, then you must vote Christine Barnes for 71st District state representative.\Chris Stewart\Grand Ledge\Please join me in voting for Angela Witwer in the upcoming state representative for the 71st District election. Not only has Delta Township been her home for 45 years she has fully embraced being a community member and volunteer to help each and every one of our neighbors.\By being a part of the Volunteers of America Host Committee for Homeless No More, Angela ensures no one is left behind.\Both her kindness and determination is why I believe she is an ideal candidate to represent the 71st District. Join me in trusting a community leader to represent and support Eaton County.\Mary Clark\Lansing\""Vote Republican — pretend everything's OK."" A friend sent me this message in 2008, after 9/11, the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and the worst financial crisis in our lifetimes.\Today, we only have to pretend that this president needs no congressional oversight and we're OK with years of Republican control in Lansing, including the Flint water crisis, the performance of our schools, the shabby patient care at our West Michigan Veterans Home, wrongfully throwing thousands off unemployment compensation, the prison food service fiasco and the failure to maintain our roads.\Vote Republican — What could possibly go wrong!\Jay Brant\East Lansing"
217,"THE QUESTIONS\1. Would you support higher taxes and/or a significant state subsidy to launch\an aggressive new regional public transit system? If yes, what type of tax?\2. How can Macomb County control development or what needs to be done to see\the county develops in a responsible manner?\1st District\Tim Dail\Age: 42\Residence: Warren\Occupation: Truck driver\Education: Lincoln High School\Personal: Married, four children\Questions:\1. No. I'm 100 percent against new taxes or higher taxes. There's always ways\to cut spending.\2. I don't think the county can really control development. What they can do\to help the situation is to make sure that our infrastructure can handle the\new development by imposing ordinances or guidelines that developers have to\help us develop the infrastructure.\Ralph Liberato\Age: 78\Occupation: Retired union representative for the UAW and AFSCME\Education: Bachelors and masters degrees from Wayne State University\Personal: Married, four children\Questions:\1. We just completed the tax increase for SMART and I will not go beyond that.\2. We as a board have already taken a position to do what we can to preserve\land. We are losing too many acres and wetlands to developers. We want to do\what we can to preserve that.\Paul Stables\Did not respond to questionnaire\Party: Libertarian\2nd District\Dianne S.

I support the formation of DARTA. However, I am concerned that it may\result in an ill-fated attempt to create a population to use mass transit\rather than meeting the needs of those who must rely on it now.\2. Macomb County can foster ""responsible"" development by promoting regional\planning and diverse land use consistent with the needs/wants of existing\communities.\Marvin E. Sauger\Party: Democrat\Age: 65\Residence: Center Line\Background: 26 years on sheriff dept, retired 1987 as sergeant in charge of\all courts; county commissioner since November 1995; coach at St. Clemens\Grade and High School; Center Line recreation department chairman; 30 U.S.\Navy Veteran member.\Education: Police and education courses at Macomb Community College for two\years; instructor for police academy light guard armory.\Personal: Married, two children\Questions:\1. No.\2. A board consisting of each community or representative. Also from county\board and planning and development. Not elected officials. Keep elected\officials out. Just inform them when ideas are finalized.\3rd District\Phillip A. DiMaria\Party: Democrat\Age: 52\Residence: Eastpointe\Background: Macomb County commissioner since 1992\Education: Attended Macomb Community College and Wayne State University\Personal: Married, two children\Questions:\1. I would not support any higher tax to finance any regional public transit\system. Our mass transit needs are being met by SMART. Any other system would\be duplicating services.\2. Macomb County can encourage local communities to develop in a manner that\stops uncontrolled suburban sprawl, but the county cannot force communities to\do anything.\Michael Dobrzechowski\Party: Republican\Age: 32\Residence: Eastpointe Background: Realtor; business owner; landlord; property\manager.\Education: BA Kalamazoo College; graduate classes University of Detroit-Mercy\Personal: Single\Questions:\1. At this time I don't see any plan now or in the future for this. People do\not want higher taxes. Nobody to my knowledge even has a plan for a new\regional public transit system.\2. I think you have to look at this on a case by case issue, who controls what\major development being built. The decisions should be made fairly from all\municipalities that make up the county. 4th District\Michael Chupa\Party: Republican\Age: 34\Residence: Warren Background: attorney Education: BS Wayne State University;\JD Detroit College of Law.\Personal: Single\Questions:\1. No. My perspective is that public transportation is far too costly. What I\prefer is a composite relationship where we have some private operations that\are supported and encouraged by the community as a whole, but I don't think\it's a good idea for the government to get into private transportation.\2. The way is to use the controls that we can at the city level. I believe the\best controls are at the city level. It is not a county-based issue. The\county board is not an appropriate board for land use controls. I don't feel\comfortable with the county undertaking that obligation.\Mike Walsh\Party: Democrat\Age: 72\Residence: Warren\Background: 13 years as county commissioner and elected six times for Macomb\County; county board chairman 1991; finance director for the Sheriff's\department; commercial industrial coordinator for city of Warren; past\chairman of the Big Four, representing top elected officials of Macomb, Wayne\and Oakland counties and city of Detroit.\Education: BA in business administration University of Detroit; attended\University of Heidelberg in Germany.\Personal: Married, eight children\Questions:\1. We've already done it. It's a done deal.\2.

No. I support lower taxes, which then free up individual capital, to\enhance the individual taxpayer's transportation needs as each individual sees\most advantageous.\2. New communities to be developed ought to bring private funding for road,\utility and security upgrades as part of their plan.\5th District\Ronald Singer\Party: Republican\Age: 51\Residence: Warren\Background: engineering manager for automotive supplier; veteran, U.S. Army.\Education: Some college and other technical training.\Personal: Married, two children\Questions:\1. No. I don't support any plan that involves higher taxes or significant\state subsidy. In fact, I don't see any distinction. Too often in the past\these plans have been promoted with wildly optimistic ridership projections\and revenue expectations.\2. Macomb County should not be planning where people can and cannot live and\raise their families. Placing restrictions on what communities or areas people\are allowed to move to will do nothing but raise the cost of housing. Most\important is that people are moving to improve their life.\Susan Doherty\Party: Democrat\Age: 35\Residence: Warren\Background: Pension specialist for Electronic Data Systems.\Education: BS in employment relations, Michigan State University, 1989\Personal: Married, three children\Questions:\1. I will not vote to increase taxes, but I would vote to have such an item on\the ballot for people to decide if it's an expense they're willing to accept.\Southeast Michigan generates a significant portion of the state tax revenue\and state government should invest in this region.\2. Redevelopment can be promoted through existing incentives. New development\cannot be controlled as easily. I don't believe government should interfere\with owner's rights, but should take action to ensure adequate, safe\infrastructure.\Louis Joseph\Did not respond to questionnaire\Party: No Party Affiliation\Residence: Warren\6th District\Aaron Stowell\Party: Republican\Age: 28\Residence: Sterling Heights\Background: Past vice-chair of Sterling Heights Citizens Advisory Committee,\corporate communications and government relations manager; staff member for\two trade associations; internship with U.S. Senator.\Education: BA in political science Wayne State University; MA George\Washington University in political management\Questions:\1. I oppose tax increases, especially since we don't know how Macomb would\figure into DARTA. State/federal transportation funding should take priority.\I strongly support public transportation; we just need to find the best plan\for Metro Detroit, particularly for Macomb County.\2. The County should reinvest in its older communities and aggressively\promote itself to business community, including furthering the Brownfield\Development Authority and providing incentives to attract/retain employers in\the county. Plan future developments with open space.\Joan Flynn\Party: Democrat\Age: 71\Residence: Warren\Background: Macomb County Commissioner; chair of Macomb County Planning and\Economic Development Committee; Macomb County Commission Mental Health\Services Board; Southeast Michigan Council of Governments.\Education: Bachelor of General Studies at Oakland University,\concentration/labor studies; associate's degree Macomb Community College;\classes toward MA Central Michigan University.\Personal: Married, 7 children\Questions:\1. I would not support a higher tax for an aggressive new regional public\transit system. Macomb has just voted to adopt Smart Transportation operating\levy of 0.6 mill for fiscal year 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006. We are satisfied with\service of SMART.\2. As far as Macomb County development, we have just hired a new executive\Director in Planning Department. He is in the process of developing a strategy\plan for the county. All cities and townships will have input. It will\definitely be a collaborative effort.\Laurel Pietrangelo\Did not respond to questionnaire\Party: Libertarian\Residence: Warren\7th District\Sue Rocca\Unopposed\8th District\Jeanne Marie Clark\Did not respond to questionnaire\Party: Republican\Residence: Sterling Heights\Diana J.

Macomb County voters in August already approved higher taxes countywide to\support the SMART public transit system. Since many communities in Wayne and\Oakland counties do not contribute financially to the current transit system,\it would be unfair to ask Macomb voters to do more.\2. Local Home Rule limits county control over development. The County Planning\Commission reviews local master plans and makes recommendations but can't\force local communities to adopt them.\9th District\Brian Lenker\Did not respond to questionnaire\Party: Republican\Residence: Sterling Heights\Robert Mijac\Party: Democrat\Age: 31\Residence: Sterling Heights\Background: County commissioner since 1995; small business owner; member,\Clinton River Watershed Council\Education: MBA Wayne State University; BA in economics Michigan State\University.\Personal: Married Questions:\1. No. Macomb County currently has a public transportation system called\SMART, which is voted by the people. The people should vote for any new\regional public transit system proposal.\2. The county must update the county master plan in order for all communities\to work together to reduce urban sprawl, create smart growth, and re-invest in\older communities.\10th District\Mary L. Marcinak\Party: Democrat\Age: 59\Residence: Sterling Heights\Background: Former councilwoman, Sterling Heights, 1981-1985; member of\Sterling Heights Area Chamber of Commerce.\Education: graduate Hamtramck High School.\Personal: Single, two daughters Questions:\1. I am not in favor of the proposed plan as presented. Detroit will not\utilize mass transit system. We must continue to support the suburban Smart\improvements to enhance local service and its door to door services currently\in place. I would like to see a plan for Express Bus Service.\2. Every County Commissioner MUST establish a good, sound, respectable\relationship with the elected legislative body and with the professional\department directors of the community that they represent, so that work could\be done collectively on development issues and on existing problems.\Philis DeSaele\Party: Republican\Age: 59\Residence: Sterling Heights\Background: County commissioner for 12 years; chair of Senior Services\Committee; member Water Quality Board.\Education: attended Macomb Community College; environmental seminars.\Personal: Widow, adopted grandmother\Questions:\1. We already pay a significant tax for SMART. We must start thinking out of\the box regarding mass transportation. Seniors and handicapped people need to\get to doctors so we need to have a lot more dial-a-ride type busses. People\are tired of line haul busses going down the street empty.\2. Development is a local issue. We can, however, help communities plan\responsibly so that their developments don't infringe on their neighbors. Good\planning and zoning is the key to good development. We must start rethinking\how we develop so that we stop polluting the water.\11th District\Ed Szczepanski\Party: Republican\Age: 33\Residence: Shelby Township\Background: County commissioner since 1998; employed at General Motors\Technical Center in Warren\Education: AAS in automotive vehicle design from Macomb Community College\Personal: Married, three children\Questions:\1. Hypothetically, if we were ever in a situation where a new regional transit\system was to be created, the only tax I could support would be in a tax\placed entirely on the price of transit bus fare tickets. I think we can all\agree that is the fairest way.\2. Setting aside larger tracks of land in the northern region for future road\growth, placing a value on current farm or undeveloped lands before they are\lost, and installing quality sewer systems throughout the county to control\E-coli is a good start.\Craig Yope\Did not respond to questionnaire\Party: Libertarian\Residence: Shelby Township\12th District\Peter Lund\Party: Republican\Age: 38\Residence: Shelby Township\Background: Macomb County commissioner 1995-96, 2000-present; chairman, Macomb\Orchard Trail Commission; member, Macomb Economic Development Corporation E\ducation: BA economics and political science, Adrian College; MBA\concentration in finance, Wayne State University\Personal: Married, two children\Questions:\1. I oppose the SpeedLink system. The cost, regardless of who pays, is not in\line with the demand of the people of Macomb County. Until SMART can prove\that people in the region want mass transportation, no larger projects should\be undertaken.\2. The county itself has little power to control development. We need to act\as a mediator and help local communities in their efforts to have the\development they desire. Macomb County government cannot tell local\communities what they can and can't do.\Patricia R. Wynn\Party: Democrat\Age: 63\Residence: Shelby Township\Background: teacher, 13 years private schools; 24 years in public schools;\teachers union representative in the Anchor Bay School District; pastoral and\social work for four years.\Education: BA and MA in education at Boston College\Questions:\1. Yes, I would support a significant state subsidy. Macomb County has given\their share in taxes and should receive an equitable return to meet its needs\because it is one of the fastest growing counties in the state.\2. The county needs to coordinate zoning and growth plans of all cities and\townships to prevent uncontrolled development. Growing too fast too soon.\Congested roads, loss of farmlands, natural habitat is not preserved. Human\needs are not sufficiently addressed for senior citizens, homeless, poor,\mentally ill, addicts, young adults and handicapped.\13th District\Don Brown\Unopposed\14th District\Kurt S. Kramer\Party: Republican\Age: 48\Residence: Chesterfield Township\Background: County commissioner, Oakland County; Fuel Quality Specialist; U.S.\Air Force Reserve; bus fleet manager and automotive technician.\Education: BS automotive parts and service management/business from University\of Southern Colorado; Associates Degree in automotive technology from Linn,\Technical College.\Personal: Married, one child\Questions:\1. NO, I would NOT support this type of tax or any other type of tax!!! The\level of taxation here in Macomb County is 'TOO HIGH'!!! I would not vote for\any tax increase and in fact, I will submit resolutions to reduce our Macomb\County taxes and thus reducing the size of our Macomb County government.\2. This issue has to be handled with utmost care as to not infringe on the\rights of the property owner and also at the same time, consider the\betterment of our community. Our local governments' planning commissions and\boards are mainly responsible in controlling this issue even though Macomb\County can and does influence some decisions though its master plan.\Wendy Iacobelli\Party: Democrat\Age: 30\Residence: Chesterfield Township\Background: Accountant/office manager\Education: AA from Walsh College, AA from Macomb Community College.\Personal: Married, two children\Questions:\1. I do not support tax increases, including gas tax, income tax or sales tax\to finance a transit system that would only benefit one percent of the public\and fewer in north Macomb county. A state subsidy would only be used to equip\such a system, not to finance its operation. That means additional local tax\dollars spent to operate such a system. In addition, the SMART millage rate\was recently doubled by voters last August.\2. I am a firm believer in local control of community development. The state\or county should never control local development because local officials have\more insight into local land use. The county can provide guidelines for\development that would include adequate open space, preservation of farm land\and traffic considerations. These guidelines would be forwarded to local\communities for consideration when they develop land use plans.\Lee Hills Jr.\Did not respond to questionnaire\Party: No Party Affiliation\Residence: Chesterfield Township\15th District\Keith Rengert\Party: Republican\Unopposed\16th District\William J.

Clemens city commissioner\1979-1990.\Education: BS Wayne State University; MA Eastern Michigan University;\Education specialist, Wayne State University.\Personal: Widowed, three children\Questions:\1. I strongly believe that an efficient regional public transit system is the\key to making this a world class region. I would support a tax only when and\if convinced that an organizational structure is in place to control such a\system.\2. This county can control development by steering development away from\farmlands and other open spaces and instead promote the use of older urban\properties. The Macomb County Brownfield Redevelopment Authority was\established to accomplish this task.\James Michael Shamaly\Party: Republican\Age: 50\Residence: Mt. Clemens Background: automotive engineer for 30 years at Ford,\Chrysler, General Motors; part-time teachers Chippewa Valley and L'Anse Creuse\Schools.\Education: Graduate of The University of Michigan (MSE-ME), Lawrence Tech\(BSME).\Questions:\1. Voter's just approved a millage increase, so SMART could continue\operations for the next 4 years. I don't think additional funding is\necessary. What SMART needs to do is focus on improving operating efficiency\to avoid canceling other bus routes do to low ridership, as was the case with\route 540 which ran along the M-59 corridor.\2. Community development should be left in the hands of local officials. Most\municipalities have a planning commission and zoning board whose primary task\is to control growth in such a manner as to maintain the quality of life\within their communities. County government should not intervene unless called\upon by local officials.\18th District\Michael C. Sessa\Party: Republican\Age: 71\Residence: Harrison Twp.\Background: Elected 1988 as County Commissioner; 20 years U.S. Air Force;\chairman for Macomb County Taxpayers Association; helped write and promote\campaign for 1978 Headlee Amendments.\Education: Six years of formal education beyond high school.\Personal: Married, four children\Questions:\1. The economy is in real bad shape: loss of jobs, overtime, medical benefits,\forced retirements, etc. I would support a transportation system if the\majority of money needed would come from federal and state sources. Michigan's\federal tax burden is extremely high while returns from the feds is extremely\low.\2. Uncontrolled development results from inadequate enforcement of local\ordinances. Property rights are sacred, the foundation of our country therein\lies the major problem. Our courts make the final decision on uncontrolled\development. Instead, the local community, politically, should make the\decision. Perhaps the decision should be taken from the court.\Gary J. Whitmore\Party: Democrat\Age: 52\Residence: Harrison Township\Background: Retired union carpenter steward; co-publisher, Michigan\Handicapper newspaper; FDR Memorial Michigan Committee, '96; St. Clair Channel\Keepers; Clinton River Watershed Council. Education: attended Eastern Michigan\University, 1968-1969; attended Lawrence Tech and Macomb Community College.\Personal: Married, three children\Questions:\1. I support the DARTA Bill which attempts to setup a multi-county commission\to consider different transit options. There has been federal money available\for years, and I would be aggressive in going after it. We need an effort to\relieve our suburban traffic congestion in a responsible 1manner.\2. Local zoning laws need to be strengthened. We need to re-use and re-develop\where infrastructure is already in place. I will fight for a smart growth\policy that aims at building in, not out. We must preserve farmland and\educate the public in the fight against urban sprawl.\19th District\James M. Perna\Party: Democrat\Age: 62\Residence: Clinton Township\Background: CEO of Health One Credit Union for more than 32 years and active\in many community organizations.\Education: attended Lawrence Tech.\Personal: Married, three daughters\Questions:\1. I have supported SMART in the past and now. I believe that the metro area\needs a better public transit system. I would support significant state\subsidy to launch a new system. However, any new system must continue, if not\improve, local transit for seniors and the handicapped.\2. This is a difficult problem. Macomb has been a high growth county and that\has been good, both for the tax base, that supports our schools infrastructure\issues, roads and water. We need to strike a balance that takes into account\the desires of the people in a community, infrastructure costs and the rights\of home and property owners.\Diane Zontini\Party: Republican\Age: 50\Residence: Clinton Township\Background: Vocational educator for 27 years; member advisory board to build\police station in two fire stations in Clinton Township.\Education: vocational educator license from North East College.\Personal: Married, one son.\Questions:\1.I would not support new taxes at this time. Funding should be increased by\the state so we could have effective mass transit system. Many other major\cities in Michigan run very effective programs.

Gov. Jennifer Granholm on Wednesday called for incentives that would encourage Michigan residents to harness the power of the sun, shortly after praising a $1 billion expansion by Hemlock Semiconductor Corp., a major supplier of solar materials.
\
Hemlock officials joined Granholm in announcing an expansion of Hemlock's manufacturing plant on a 60-acre site -- a project that that could bring up to 500 jobs to Saginaw County.
\
The expansion will allow the company, which Dow-Corning holds a majority stake in, to nearly double its production of polycrystalline silicon by 2010.
\
There have been worldwide shortages of that material, which is a key component of photovoltaic cells -- used to produce solar power. Polycrystalline silicon is also used in computer chips and other electronics.
\
""We want to re-brand Michigan as the alternative energy capital of the world,"" Granholm said.
\
To accomplish that, she said, Michigan not only must be home to companies such as Hemlock and Auburn Hills-based United Solar Ovonic, the state's citizens must become larger consumers of alternative energies.
\
""What we need to do is take a hard policy look at providing incentives for the use of these solar panels in Michigan,"" Granholm told The Detroit News. ""In Germany they created 170,000 jobs by changing the incentives for the use of wind and solar. We ought to be doing the same thing in Michigan.""
\
Sales of solar equipment are much stronger in places such as California and Europe where government incentives encourage citizens to use greener sources of power. Incentives could create jobs for installation of solar panels and create local customers for companies already based here.
\
Among the incentives Granholm would consider is stronger net metering incentives. Net metering would allow a homeowner or business that generates excess power from solar, or other renewable energy, to sell that power back to utilities.
\
Critics, however, say incentives and net metering programs ultimately drive up the price of power.
\
""The reason we don't have those incentives is so-called alternative energy is very expensive,"" said Diane Katz, director of science, environment and technology policy for the Mackinac Center. She said utilities can produce and buy electricity at lower rates than they'd likely have to pay for excess power from individuals.
\
Others contend if Michigan uses more renewable energy, prices will fall closer to that of conventional sources.
\
Michigan has several growing alterative energy-related companies. Hemlock's expansion will add as many as 250 jobs to their payroll and hire up to 250 more contract workers.
\
United Solar employs 500 workers in Auburn Hills and plans to add 300 more at plants in Greenville. There are also a handful of wind energy projects under way and several auto suppliers focused on alterative fuels.
\
""Germany was once the automotive capital of Europe, now they're a leader in renewable energy. I think Michigan can learn a lesson from that,"" said Subhendu Guha, president of United Solar.

219,"Michigan needs an energy boost. That's energy as in electricity. The state needs more of it and needs it soon. To the greatest extent possible, it should be homegrown.\Despite the flagging economy, most studies show that Michigan's demand for electricity will continue to grow, albeit at a modest rate. The latest study from a Public Service Commission work group projects an annual increase in demand of 1.2%. Combined with the age of some of Michigan's power plants and the logistical problems of moving power into and through peninsulas, there is a solid case for new electricity sources to assure that Michigan can keep the lights on, keep its residents comfortably cool on hot days, and have a stable supply for whatever new businesses can be attracted here.\The PSC study group is expected to report next month with recommendations to Gov. Jennifer Granholm on how best to meet Michigan's electricity needs over the next decade. She has asked that it include a recommendation for renewable energy.\The Legislature will then pick up the ball next year, and lawmakers appear geared up to act. The interest in energy policy showed up during the election campaign, with 87 candidates for the Legislature signing Environment Michigan's 25x25 pledge - supporting 25% renewable energy by 2025. Thirty-three of those candidates won their races.\In another show of interest, 7,000 Consumers Energy customers have volunteered to pay a slight premium to support the company's purchases of power from renewable sources.\The appetite for alternative energy sources does not take away the need for one or two new power plants. But the future increasingly lies with solutions that minimize the use of fossil fuels, even abundant ones such as coal. Here's how the state can lay the groundwork:\*Renewables: Many states have set a minimum for alternative sources of energy, generally called a renewable portfolio standard. A PSC study group has found that a 7% renewable portfolio standard for Michigan is readily achievable - which means the Legislature needs to aim higher. Other states have a 10% threshold. Possibilities include wood chips, methane from landfills and farms, wind turbines and, eventually, solar power, as the price comes down.\*Conservation:Good policies could slow the projected increase in demand by as much as half, according to another PSC study group. Lawmakers need to return to conservation-minded building codes, upgrade state facilities and help municipalities do the same. The federal government also could help by setting high efficiency standards for new appliances.\*Interconnections, net metering: Imagine a system that feeds power from homes and businesses into the grid, as well as delivering it. The next big change may not be a new fuel source as much as a way to coordinate interconnections among many sources. Then small solar and wind systems can help meet demand beyond their own needs; factories would have an incentive to generate power off some of their other processes.\That would make the electricity grid more like the Internet, broadly distributed and interactive - and vulnerable to chaos without good protocols. Figuring out how to make this work, known as net metering, will be a huge advantage to any state that pulls it off.\In harsh economic times, it's easy to fall for the line about asking the last person leaving Michigan to turn off the lights. By taking leadership in strong energy policies, Michigan might actually turn on more lights.\(SIDEBAR)\Untapped wind energy\Mike Shriberg, director of Environment Michigan, says Michigan can boost its economy by turning toward renewable energy.\In an essay available online at freep.com/opinion, Shriberg writes: ""Michigan is the 14th windiest state - with enough wind potential to power the entire state - yet we have only three commercial turbines, less than any state in the top 20. The primary reason is that we do not have a renewable energy standard, which requires a percentage of electricity to come from renewable sources.""\ILLUSTRATION: Photo\MEMO: FREE PRESS EDITORIAL;SIDEBAR ATTACHED\DISCLAIMER: THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION MAY DIFFER SLIGHTLY FROM THE PRINTED ARTICLE"
220,"When it comes to renewable energy, Michigan is at an inflection point.\The state is now on track to meet mandates set in 2008 to generate about 10% of its energy from renewable sources, and power companies, policy makers, legislators and environmental groups are debating where to place bets on the state's future energy needs as old power plants are replaced.\They are weighing many factors, including the environmental and financial impact their decisions have on the state.\""Michigan is facing the transformation of our electric industry,"" said Irene Dimitry, a DTE vice president. ""We -- DTE, and many other stakeholders, legislation and administration -- are actively working on the policy and planning issues to make sure we have reliable, affordable energy for our customers.""\Energy executives and officials anticipate there will be more renewable power in the future, often referring to what they call a ""balanced portfolio"" of energy. But how much more renewable energy will there be, and what makes a portfolio balanced? That depends on how you weight priorities -- and who you think should pay for it.\The move to renewable energy sources in Michigan has picked up in the past five years, in part, from regulatory mandates, but also from declining costs of power generation and changing attitudes about the environment. In addition, in that time, the cost of renewable power has dropped by about half in some cases, and likely to continue to decline.\A balancing act\So what's next?\In March, Gov. Rick Snyder outlined a renewable energy plan calling for the state to meet up to 40% of its power needs through energy waste reduction, increased use of natural gas and renewable energy sources.\Still, waste reduction or cutting power production -- in contrast to boosting generation -- is a long-term strategy that energy-producing utilities acknowledge requires them to do something that's counter-intuitive in business: Convincing customers to buy less of the very product they are seeking to sell.\In addition, the Obama administration is seeking a 30% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, which, utility executives have said, is likely to encourage more renewable power sources.\""The state's future energy policy is at the forefront of dialogue among Michigan's policy and business leaders, advocacy groups and stakeholders,"" said an August report prepared for the state's energy office. ""Concurrently, the business landscape for electric utilities is shifting due to factors like emerging technologies, changing economics of different fuel sources, state and federal policies, aging infrastructure, and regional wholesale electric market influences.""\About half of Michigan's power is generated from coal plants, a significant source of carbon dioxide emissions, but is seeking to reduce its dependence on coal-fired power plants as the state aims to cut its greenhouse gas emissions from power plants by 31% from 2012 levels.\DTE has announced plans to retire a third of its coal generation, more than 2,000 megawatts, by 2025, and rely on more natural gas and renewable energy.\Value of investment\In some ways, the decisions may come down to what the decision makers value.\Take the example of Ari Kresch, who last year made made a big investment -- big for him as a private business operator, but small compared to the bets publicly held utilities companies would have to make -- in green energy.\For about $1 million, he added four rooftop wind turbines, 550 solar panels, high-efficiency lighting and electric-vehicle charging stations to his Southfield law offices. His aim was to benefit the environment and boost the profile of his firm. To do this, he received about $300,000 in tax credits, and he expected to save money on the power he used.\""The way I measure it, the project has been exceedingly effective,"" he said. ""We enlightened a population that was in the dark about renewable energy in an urban area.""\From a financial standpoint, he said the falling energy prices also means his investment isn't paying off nearly as well as he had anticipated.\Like Kresch, power companies have to weigh priorities to make decisions. But unlike a utility he does not have the same pressure to deliver profits, he's not beholden to shareholders, and his customers are seeking law services, not to buy electricity in a competitive market at the lowest cost.\""Not everything I do is predicated on return on investment,"" he said. ""I don't have to answer to anybody but my wife.""\Still the attorney acknowledged, money was a key factor in his decision.\""If they wouldn't have given me the tax credit, I wouldn't have considered it,"" Kresch said. ""It would have been too expensive.""\Winds of change\John Sarver, president of the Great Lakes Renewable Energy Association in Rockford, credits the state's regulatory mandates of renewable power for the shift to more of it and advocates continuing to use state mandates to increase the mix of renewable energy sources, but he is less specific on outlining those mandates.\""Let's continue with what we've been doing,"" he said, urging a continued gradual increase in renewable sources.\The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates power plants generate about 13% of electricity from renewable sources nationally.\Of Michigan's renewable sources, nearly half is from wind, a quarter from biomass, 17% from landfill gas and solid waste, about 10% from hydroelectric and less than 1% is from solar, according to the state's public service commission.\Wind energy which is free and abundant in some places in the state, has created jobs, given rise to new companies that supply components -- such as Ventower Industries in Monroe -- and even inspired school projects and tourism. There are now more than 20 wind farms in Michigan that are operational and in development, and capacity of more than 1,500 megawatts.\Still, wind, the utilities point out, doesn't blow all the time, which means power generation is intermittent, and the power that from each project is tiny -- most less than 100 megawatts -- in comparison to nuclear and plants, which can generate thousands of megawatts of power.\Some Michigan residents have started to object to wind turbines -- some as tall as the Fisher Building -- because the whirling blades make noise, harm flying birds and obstruct views of the horizon, and power companies are now wrestling with communities that are starting to debate whether to limit the size and number of turbines.\""Renewables, certainly, will be part of the mix, but it won't be the only thing that will have to be considered and built going forward,"" said Tim Sparks, a vice president at Consumers Energy, which last month announced a deal to purchase power from a new 100-megawatt wind farm in the Thumb. ""I think, over time, you could get maybe up around 20% or so from renewables.""\Solar power shift\Last month, DTE opened its largest array in Ann Arbor Township, a 1.1 megawatt project, on about nine acres. End-to-end, the south-facing panels visible from M-14 could cover the University of Michigan's football field and then some. About 4,000 panels are angled to catch the sun's rays and turn it into enough to power nearly 200 homes, according to the utility.\Even larger projects are planned to open in Michigan this year and next, including one that is 50 times bigger.\DTE's larger scale projects seem to be part of a trend toward more large, solar arrays in the state and nationwide.\The Solar Energy Industries Association, a Washington-based trade association, estimates there are nearly 200 solar companies in Michigan, employing about 2,100 people.\""I know solar is the wave of the future,"" said Mark Hagerty, president of Michigan Solar Solutions, who in 2007 started what is now a five-employee company in Commerce Township that installs rooftop solar arrays. ""From every direction it appeared to be a good business to get in.""\DTE -- the largest investor in solar power in the state -- operates more than 20 solar projects in the state, including some at Ford in Dearborn and Monroe Community College in Monroe.\""I believe there will be more solar,"" Dimitry said. ""It's still quite expensive here in Michigan, all you have to do is look out the window today and realize we don't have the right climate. But as costs come down it may mean more and more. We continue to explore it, and we are hopeful we will move forward with more and more projects.""\Still, as an example how complex this balancing act is, as big utilities seek to generate more solar power, they are also stoking tensions with solar advocates, rooftop installers and homeowners who have benefited from financial incentives to use solar power by supporting legislative proposals to change rates for customers in net metering programs.\DTE and Consumers Energy both support legislation that would reduce some of the subsidies -- and to some extent incentives -- that are available to residential power users who, the power companies said is costing them millions and unfair to customers who aren't getting subsidies.\The Great Lakes Renewable Energy Association, which also wants more solar, and other groups disagree that net metering is a subsidy.\So, while in this debate both sides seem to agree on adding more solar energy generation, they are divided on who should pay for it.\Contact Frank Witsil: 313-222-5022."

Numbers released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that income disparities among different ethnic groups in the U.S. remain pronounced.
\
Median weekly earnings for Black males are just 75.6 percent of the median for White males, and Black females' earnings were 82.3 percent of the median for White females. Overall, African Americans are more than twice as likely to live in poverty as non-African Americans.
\
Those Americans - including many minority families - who remain below the poverty line face a sea of challenges, but one of the most important is the cost of household energy. This is a basic need. Every family needs to heat and cool its home. So when we talk about energy policies in this country, we need to focus on the importance of affordability.
\
I recently had the opportunity to participate in a discussion in Charlotte, N.C. at the 2015 American Association of Blacks in Energy national conference, where we discussed some of the energy policy challenges of particular concern for the African American community.
\
One such topic is renewable energy and how to foster its growth so that one day all consumers who want to make the choice to rely on clean fuels can. That we are fortunate enough to be at this point part of the energy policy debate is a testament to the innovation and cutting-edge technologies that this country is championing. Of course, any new opportunity brings challenges along with opportunities, and the dynamics behind the growth of rooftop solar panels specifically are no exception.
\
In fact, one rooftop solar policy that I spoke about at the conference is actually tipping the scales against minority and underserved communities like mine in favor of those who are more fortunate. That policy, called net metering, overcompensates rooftop solar users and essentially lets them bypass the cost of paying for the grid.
\
This just does not work. The grid is something we all rely on to get our electricity. This includes those with rooftop solar panels that depend on the grid to get electricity when the sun doesn't shine. So when rooftop solar users cut and run from paying for the grid, everyone else has to pick up the slack.
\
Because of the economics of rooftop solar, ""everyone else"" in this case ends up being the less financially welloff. Just think about it. First and foremost, you've got to have a house. This automatically eliminates anyone who lives in community housing, rents an apartment, or lacks clear property rights. And, according to a 2008 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, approximately 75 percent of all residential rooftop areas in the United States aren't suitable for rooftop solar panels, because of climate, trees, and other constraints.
\
Finally, rooftop solar systems, which can run up to $40,000, are not financially feasible for many. Even to lease the panels, consumers must have a high credit score, which is yet another barrier. So the cloudy reality with net metering is that it is a regressive policy, serving as a wealth transfer from the poor to the rich.
\
Ultimately, this is an issue of social justice, especially if it leads to the creation of energy poverty zones.
\
There are some bright spots when it comes to this issue, however. Arizona, for example, is leading the way by trying to institute a cost structure that ensures the fair integration of rooftop solar while also sufficiently supporting the grid.
\
The path forward is clear. Through discussions like the one we had in Charlotte, and in various forums across the country, energy stakeholders have an opportunity to shape policies that are more inclusive of minority communities.
\
The good news is that meaningful public policies changes really can smooth the economic outlook for Americans, including minority populations. In today's economic environment, every fix counts.

222,"like cursing, accepting duels\LANSING -- Outdated crimes such as accepting a duel and cursing in front of women or children would no longer be on Michigan's books under bills advancing in the Legislature.\The House on Wednesday began voting to repeal 75 laws that legislators say no longer serve a purpose or have been made redundant by newer statutes. The archaic and apparently unenforced laws include prohibitions against ads related to sexually transmitted diseases and accepting a challenge to a duel.\The seven-bill package also would delete laws prohibiting the national anthem from being played in public ""without embellishments or other melodies"" and lift bans against stealing vegetables from someone's garden. Michigan would still have broader penalties for trespassing and larceny.\Charges possible after man\takes selfies, damages police car\KALAMAZOO -- Police in Michigan say a man who damaged a parked police cruiser while taking selfies on the unoccupied vehicle is remorseful but still could face charges.\The Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety says he approached the car about 3:40 a.m. on Aug. 9 in downtown and took photos in front of the vehicle, kneeling on the hood and lying on the windshield. Police say he then climbed onto the roof of the cruiser before leaving.\An officer returned to the car and found the damage. The suspect's actions were recorded by the vehicle's dash camera. He was last seen skateboarding away.\Police say the 21-year-old from Kalamazoo contacted them Friday after investigators released an image of him from the video and said he didn't intend to damage the car.\Michigan adjusted unemployment rate dips to 5.3 percent\LANSING -- Michigan's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dipped last month to match the national average.\The Michigan Department of Technology, Management & Budget released state and regional employment figures Wednesday.\July's statewide jobless rate was 5.3 percent, down two-tenths of a percentage point from June. It was 7 percent in July 2014.\The state says the number of unemployed in Michigan dropped by 12,000 last month.\Bureau of Labor Market Information and Strategic Initiatives Director Jason Palmer says the July jobless rate reduction ""was primarily due to a minor decline in the number of individuals actively seeking work.""\Gov. Rick Snyder says it's the lowest monthly rate for the state since August 2001. He says more than 420,000 private sector jobs and opportunities have been created since the end of 2010.\Residents with solar panels protest Michigan energy measure\LANSING -- Advocates of installing solar panels on rooftops are protesting Michigan legislation they warn would make it harder for residents to reduce utility bills with their own renewable energy sources.\Dozens rallied Wednesday at the Capitol, holding umbrellas to urge lawmakers not to block the sun. They also testified at a Senate committee considering legislation with utility-backed changes to Michigan's ""net metering"" program.\Some 1,800 customers across Michigan have installed their own solar panels or wind turbines.\Critics say proposed changes would make it harder for residents to see a payback on generating their own electricity.\Utilities say rooftop solar generation costs are nearly twice as high as utility-scale installations.\The net metering fight is part of a broader rewrite of Michigan's energy law expected to intensify in Lansing this fall\28-year-old chimpanzee dies unexpectedly at Detroit Zoo\ROYAL OAK -- A 28-year-old chimpanzee has died unexpectedly at the Detroit Zoo.\The zoo in the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak said on its Facebook page that Akati collapsed at the Great Apes of Harambee exhibit and died Tuesday.\In the post, the zoo describes her as ""a lovely, intelligent being and a wonderful mother"" to 7-year-old Ajua and 4-year-old Akira.\Zoo spokeswoman Patricia Janeway says in an email Wednesday that the zoo is awaiting results of a necropsy to determine cause of death.\Initiative announced to oppose Canadian nuclear waste plan\FLINT -- A member of Congress wants people in Michigan to share opposition to a Canadian proposal to store nuclear waste underground less than a mile from the Lake Huron shore.\Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee of Michigan and Michigan Senate Democratic leader Jim Ananich on Wednesday announced an effort to encourage people to write the Canadian Minister of the Environment.\Kildee says the ""community initiative"" will oppose Ontario Power Generation's plan for disposal of low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste near Kincardine, Ontario.\The company says the project won't contaminate Lake Huron, but opponents say anything could happen over thousands of years.\Kildee and Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters have introduced legislation that would require the U.S. State Department to demand a new study of risks to the lake."
223,"
The federal stimulus package has a few bright spots for Michigan, including a 30 percent federal tax credit for small wind turbine investment. A similar 2005 tax credit expanded the solar industry, and Michigan has plenty of wind.
\
Changing the nature and source of energy consumption in this country is a national priority; that debate is over. This challenge requires a number of aggressive policy actions, but a federal solution is only half the battle. The bad news: Congress is losing that half for us.
\
The truth is, energy is everywhere, much of it is clean and renewable. But America has struggled to realize they are context-specific sources.
\
Most clean energy is not transportable - it is where it is - and it varies across the country. The sun is bright in Arizona; the wind is strong in the Great Lakes. We can burn coal and natural gas anywhere, but we can't ship wind and solar resources across the state.
\
By the way, Michigan consumes the eighth-highest amount of coal in America. Guess how much coal is mined in the state. You're right - none. That's billions of dollars we send outside the state every year to pay for that awful fuel.
\
Congressional leaders, for one reason or another, prefer their way of industry or fuel-specific subsidies and tax breaks, which has created an odd situation in which Congress is managing our nation's renewable energy portfolio.
\
This system is preventing us from running a country on clean energy. Remember when corn ethanol was supposed to solve problems? Yeah, good times. But we're still sending millions of federal dollars to the heartland for an unwanted fuel that is terrible for the environment.
\
Federal officials shouldn't write policy for specific fuels or sources. Congress can encourage contextualization of renewable energy generation by putting a national price on carbon and investing in the energy grid. States, local governments, and American entrepreneurs will take care of the rest.
\
When we get our price on carbon, the people who create our renewable energy portfolio will be those who produce and consume renewable energy.
\
This price on emitting carbon is actually in our near future, and it'll likely be monitored and tracked at a state level. One of the first things the president did in office was sign an order allowing a number of states to do this on their own. Ask any state or local official, the federal government often operates this way.
\
Believe it or not, the state government has laid some great foundations - a renewable portfolio standard and a lesser-known net metering program, encouraging disaggregated production of renewables. This is only the beginning, and far more aggressive approaches must follow.
\
A national carbon price is coming. State and local governments need to get ready for it with policies that are relatively ""fuel-blind,"" like an RPS, net-metering and perhaps even the politically unpopular system of feed-in-tariffs. We must cultivate every type of clean energy in every context in our state.

225,"
As Michigan's business and political leaders come together on Mackinac Island during the Uetroit Regional Chamber's annual Mackinac Policy Conference, their focus is clear: reigniting and growing Michigan's economy.
\
An important way to do that is to put in place a comprehensive energy policy to attract new businesses and move Michigan forward. That process is now under' way at the state capitol, and it promises to spur the state's fledgling alternative energy industry into the powerhouse that Gov. Granholm envisions. The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSCX supports this effort by promoting renewable energy through its policies, to the extent allowed under Michigan legislation, and by issuing technology grants that allow Michigan-based organizations to act as incubators of innovation.
\
A critical mass of alternative energy businesses already exists in Michigan:
\
* A wind farm is up and running in Huron County in Michigan's Thumb.
\
* Over two dozen manufacturers across the state already produce parts used in wind turbines.
\
* Michigan's United Solar Ovonic is a leader in the production of solar cells in Greenville, Mich.;
\
* Hemlock Semiconductor Corp. near Saginaw is the world's largest maker of polycrystalline silicon, the major material input used in solar panels and semiconductor chips; and
\
* Muskegon's Alternative and Renewable Energy Center (MAREC) continues to be a national leader as a demonstration center for using alternative and renewable energy technologies.
\
Michigan is ready to take the next step in attracting new alternative energy businesses. With a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) in the works, Michigan stands to benefit even more from alternative energy businesses. Many are poised to establish a presence in Michigan. The modest RPS under discussion in the Michigan Legislature has broad bipartisan support and moves Michigan in a positive direction.
\
It helps diversify Michigan's fuel mix, making it less dependent on fossil fuels; helps jump start the burgeoning alternative energy industry in Michigan, creating new, high-paying jobs; and will help improve the environment as our state's need for energy from existing coal plants can be diminished. With the appropriate legislative action in place, Michigan manufacturers will be supplying the parts and technology necessary to support renewable energy projects in Michigan, the nation, and around the world.
\
In addition to an RPS, several other actions by the MPSC are promoting the use of renewable energy and technology in Michigan.
\
The Commission has approved renewable energy programs that allow electric customers of eight regulated electric utilities to get part or all of their electricity from renewable sources. Thousands of customers have chosen to pay as little as $2.50 per month to support renewable energy in Michigan. This new demand for green power has spurred wind turbine projects around the state.
\
Electric customers also now have the option of offsetting their electric purchases and receiving a credit from the utility for any excess electricity generated from renewable sources, a process called net metering. The MPSC is currently considering rule changes to make it easier to interconnect with the utility and become a net metering customer.
\
Finally, the MPSC has promoted the use of alternative energy technologies through $24.7 million in energy efficiency grants. An additional $15 million will be awarded later this year.
\
One grant recipient is the MAREC center previously mentioned. The first facility of its kind in the world, it is a prototype distributed energy center, as well as a venture that will attract new businesses to Michigan. The MAREC building produces all the energy it needs to heat, cool, light and power itself. It is using fuel cells that turn natural gas into electricity, has a Michigan-made photovoltaic roof that turns sunlight into power, and has special Michigan-made batteries that store excess energy for use during periods of peak need.
\
Another premier MPSC grant recipient is NextEnergy, a corporation founded to advance Michigan as a leader in alternative energy. NextEnergy's microgrid demonstration project in Detroit is testing and demonstrating emerging alternative energy technologies, including renewable energy, fuel cells and combined heat and power systems.
\
And just this month, the MPSC announced more energy efficiency grants, including $5 million for a plugin electric hybrid electric vehicle pilot program awarded to a partnership of the University of Michigan, General Motors and DTE Energy. The MPSC wants to make sure that Michigan's electric grid is ready for the widespread use of PHEVs.
\
As the automotive capital of the world, Michigan is well-suited to capitalize on this technology. PHEVs give Michigan's auto companies a pivotal opportunity to retain and expand on their role as world leaders in automotive production, design and engineering excellence. And Michigan's two largest electric utilities - Detroit Edison and Consumers Energy - intend to begin deployment of advanced metering infrastructure in their service territories this year. The new metering technologies will enable many important improvements in electric grid operations, including the use of PHEVs.
\
The time is right for Michigan's utilities and automotive companies to move forward with integrating PHEVs into the electric grid in a way that enhances both, especially as gasoline prices continue to rise.
\
Projects like this are the result of making investments in great ideas and people who carry them out. The MPSC's grants have helped spur that on.
\
So, whether it is manufacturing parts of solar and wind projects, being a customer of renewable energy sources, or supporting the research and development or renewable energy projects and technologies, Michigan is ready to become the alternative energy business leader. The MPSC is doing its part to promote technology and programs that assist in reaching this goal.

Dick Haley hopes to one day capture all of his household electricity from renewable sources.
\
The Springport resident is already closer to that goal than most homeowners. A 120-foot wind turbine towers on the lawn, while a geothermal heating and cooling system runs underground.
\
""If it would take care of the total consumption of electricity, that's a big return. It's the best investment today that I can think of,"" said Haley, who lives in a 2,000-square-foot house on 70 acres about 10 miles south of Eaton Rapids.
\
Several local wind turbine efforts have been on a commercial scale. For example, Two Men and a Truck International Inc. in Delhi Township and Horrocks Farm Market in Delta Township have installed turbines to harness the wind to help power their operations.
\
But a new startup company, Eaton Rapids-based RLS Energy, delved into the residential market this week when it installed the turbine at Haley's home.
\
The turbine was manufactured by Westport Point, Mass.-based Aerostar Inc.
\
Haley did some of the work himself.
\
He spent $50,000 on the turbine and installation. Without that work, the price would have been about $60,000.
\
RLS Energy owner Rob Sepeter expects Haley could recoup his expenses in 15 to 18 years.
\
But if energy costs rise and the government rolls out more green energy incentive programs, that repayment time could be shortened, Sepeter said.
\
Haley plans to apply for a federal energy efficiency tax credit for 30 percent of the turbine cost.
\
He also wants to set up a net metering program with Jackson-based utility Consumers Energy so he can stockpile credit for extra energy produced during high-wind times and use it later.
\
Part of the attraction of wind power is environmental friendliness, but there's another draw for Haley.
\
""I'd be lying if I didn't hope there was a money factor, too,"" he said. Haley is retired and on a fixed income.
\
Sepeter also likes the combined benefits for the environment and his wallet. He said his large electric bill led him to find ways to cut costs, while his interest in electricity - he's an electrician by trade - spurred him to start his own renewable energy business with his wife, Lisa.
\
""I'm already heating with wood,"" he said.
\
""I'm looking at wind and solar, and I actually just got on the Internet and started going through the different products available for small wind.""

227,"Q: With potential Y2K power outages and normal ones due to storms and summer\brownouts, I am considering adding a solar energy system. What do you think of\this and do you have any tips?\A: Installing a PV (photovoltaic) electricity generating system is an\effective method to deal with power outages. PV systems use solar cells that\convert the sun's rays into electricity. Some small systems, such as\Evergreen, are sold as complete, simple-to-install kits.\There have been improvements in solar cell efficiency, and the costs have\dropped. If your house needs a new roof, consider solar shingles, which have\solar cells built in. These solar shingles are attached with nails.\Solar cell panels are thin, lightweight and easy to handle. They can be tilted\up on the roof or laid flat so they are barely visible from the ground.\Since a PV system continuously generates electricity during daylight hours, at\times it will produce more power than you need. Some of the excess electricity\is used to keep several deep-draw backup batteries charged.\In many states and municipalities, utility companies must offer net metering\billing. This means that your electric meter slows down or runs in reverse\when the PV system is generating electricity.\The primary reasons to install a PV system are for backup electricity or\concern for the environment. PV systems are silent, require little maintenance\(no moving parts) and create no pollution.\To plan a system, determine the power usage of the appliances you need to keep\running during an emergency. This often includes the refrigerator, a water or\sump pump, lights and a radio or TV. If you're concerned about Y2K problems in\January, you may want to include your furnace.\The total wattage of these necessary electrical appliances determines the size\of the battery pack that is required. During a power outage at night, all the\electricity comes from the batteries. During the day, the solar panels provide\electricity and keep the batteries charged.\Knowing the total wattage also determines the number of PV solar cell panels\needed. This varies depending on the solar cell technology you choose, your\budget and the amount of sun energy available in your area.\The two basic types of PV solar cells are crystalline and thin film.\Crystalline has proven reliability and some kits have a 20-year warranty. Thin\film is newer and less expensive, but requires larger panels and more area.\Write for Update Bulletin 812, a buyer's guide of PV systems, kits, PV shingle\manufacturers, a selection and sizing guide and prices.

Austerberry said it's not common for customers to produce their own power, but said that as customers embrace emerging technology, DTE Energy wants to make sure it keeps up.\""It's not that common, but we do have programs to accommodate customers who want to generate their own power on site and provide access to the grid,"" Austerberry said. ""We have programs to encourage customers to look at that and there are incentives for them, but the technology and price is ultimately going to drive what they do.

Geothermal energy is heat created within the Earth that can be captured as steam or hot water to heat buildings or generate electricity.\The two companies often work in tandem to provide hybrid, solar-geothermal packages for their customers.\""People are coming to recognize what kilowatts are and how much they're using, so if they want to lower the bill, they have to understand what is causing that charge to go up,"" Lakatos explained.\Wind turbines are more expensive upfront and depend on a home's or business' proximity to strong wind. Most buildings, aside from those without direct sunlight, are strong candidates for solar panels, which are often less expensive, Lakatos said.\Last year, Lakatos opened Team Energy Solutions Inc. in Howell Township, which trains people to install solar, wind and geothermal systems.\His training business also has garnered the attention of colleges and universities -- potentially supplying tomorrow's solar technicians.\The outgoing Granholm administration has touted renewable-energy businesses like Lakatos' as a future boom business in Michigan, and one to help replace the nearly a million jobs lost in the state in the past decade.\Lakatos agrees with the governor's vision for Michigan.\""This is an added-value program,"" he said.\Contact Daily Press & Argus reporter Christopher Behnan at (517) 548-7108 or at cbehnan@gannett.com."
230,"LANSING - Gov. Jennifer Granholm, whatever one may think of her politics or management skills, is a paragon of public comportment.\She's always calm, carefully spoken, fastidious about avoiding showy perks and trappings of power.\That's why I was startled, during an interview in her office this week, to hear Granholm say, ""I feel very Machiavellian about this,"" referring to her desire to bring alternative energy jobs to Michigan. According to definitions of Machiavellianism I consulted, this suggests that she might deceive or manipulate others, or use any means necessary to get those jobs.\""I think this is such a moment for us to capitalize on, creating this whole new sector here,"" Granholm added, warming to her cause. ""And if other states have done it without the resources that we have, then we can certainly explode onto the scene.""\Problem is, Michigan is a laggard, not a leader, in wind-power generation and other clean green technologies that could help the environment, reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil and, yes, replace at least some of the gazillion manufacturing jobs we've lost.\Michigan is a laggard because other states have beaten us to the punch with policy actions that make them look attractive and welcoming to inventors, entrepreneurs and giant companies that have spied alt-energy as a growth opportunity.\Back in 1991, Iowa became the first state in the nation to adopt a renewable portfolio standard (RPS), which mandates a state to generate a specified portion of its electricity from renewable sources such as wind, solar, biomass, geothermal or other alternatives to fossil fuels.\By 1997, Massachusetts, Nevada and Minnesota had renewable standards. Today 24 have an RPS, and four others have nonbinding goals for adoption of renewable energy. Michigan is not among them.\In testimony last week before state Sen. Bruce Patterson's energy policy committee, Seth Dunn, general manager of strategic marketing for Atlanta-based GE Energy, said more than $9 billion was invested last year in wind-energy facilities in the United States. Of that total, 96% went to states with renewable standards.\""We are now at a point in the industry where the presence of RPS is very important to our investment decision,"" Dunn said. Fred Keller, CEO of Cascade Engineering in Grand Rapids, agreed.\""Michigan has a onetime opportunity to win a leadership role in competition among many states in the renewable energy industry that is growing at over 30% a year. But it takes enlightened policy in addition to our many other assets to do so,"" Keller said at Patterson's hearing.\Cascade recently launched a new venture to produce small wind turbines for home and commercial use. Keller recommended that Michigan adopt a standard mandating that 10% of electricity come from renewable sources by 2015, citing a national study that estimated 34,000 new Michigan jobs could come from wind and solar energy projects alone.\Granholm is trying to get the Legislature to put RPS on a fast track for approval and expects action by the Michigan House on a bill this month. But she's worried that things could bog down in the Senate, where the Republican majority has expressed concerns about whether electricity costs will rise. Wind power, Granholm insisted, will be as cheap or cheaper than future power from new coal-fired plants.\Sadly, Michigan's pokey progress toward a renewable energy policy initiative hasn't come from ignorance of the fact that alt-energy could be a big job creator for the state.\In 2002, a year before Granholm took office, Republican Gov. John Engler broke ground in Detroit for NextEnergy, the nonprofit formed to accelerate development of an alternative energy industry here. Granholm pushed alt-energy hard in her 2005 State of the State speech.\""RPS is the single most important policy initiative that must pass to demonstrate to the world that we are serious about alternative energy,"" NextEnergy CEO Jim Croce told me Wednesday. ""Without RPS we're an also-ran.""\""The issue is urgency. We have to get in the game,"" Granholm said.\Even if she needs to go Machiavellian to make it happen.\Contact TOM WALSH at 313-223-4430 or twalsh@freepress.com.\ILLUSTRATION: Photo\CAPTION: ""The issue is urgency.

Michigan's energy future can be found right on our farms.
\
Landowners are putting up wind turbines amid the acres of soy, corn, wheat and other crops they have planted. Dairy farmers like me are installing methane digesters, which convert tons of animal waste into renewable electricity every day.
\
In an era when pollution and climate change threaten our lakes, land and air, we must look beyond coal plants and imported fossil fuels to power our economy forward. Renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, methane digesters, and biomass, can protect our environment while providing the electricity our state needs.
\
Renewable energy can boost the state's economy as well. For farmers, renewable electricity provides income that strengthens our businesses and supports local economies. Renewable sources of electricity help diversify our energy supply and stabilize energy prices, which helps consumers. A vibrant renewable energy industry in a state creates jobs and encourages local investments, too.
\
It's time Michigan enacts a sound policy that fosters renewable energy development and all its benefits.
\
At our farm in mid-Michigan, we raise more than 7,000 head of cattle on 6,500 acres of land. We proactively found a way to use new technology to turn manure into energy. We have a methane digester, which uses an anaerobic process to separate methane from the manure.
\
The by-products of our completed process are recyclable water, which we use to wash our facilities or irrigate crops, and fiber cake, which we compost or use as a fertilizer. We sell the methane to North American Biofuels in Okemos, which operates a generator on the farm and turns the methane into electricity.
\
Instead of creating pollution, our farm produces clean-burning, cow-based energy.
\
Unfortunately, there are only a handful of such digesters in Michigan right now.
\
Digesters are expensive to build, and farmers need energy developers to help finance the projects. Because Michigan lacks a robust policy that encourages renewable energy development, developers are currently taking their investment dollars elsewhere.
\
Those dollars are funding projects in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois, all states that have a policy which is driving renewable energy development: the renewable portfolio standard.
\
A renewable portfolio standard or RPS requires a certain percentage of electricity come from renewable sources by a certain deadline. Twenty-six states and the District of Columbia have an RPS.
\
It's time Michigan enacted one as well or be in danger of getting left behind while renewable energy projects are built in our Midwest neighbors' backyards. Without a robust RPS, projects won't come to Michigan. Our farmers will lose out. And our entire state will miss a tremendous opportunity to participate in the booming renewable energy sector.
\
Michigan needs a new energy policy, from a strong RPS to adequate infrastructure such as more electrical lines in rural areas. Agriculture is eager to partner with the state and with business to move our energy future forward.
\
And the best way to make progress, attract investments and strengthen the economy is to adopt a strong RPS for the state.

But, lo! There is a prospect on the horizon who should be signed quickly, before his true value is appreciated by other teams. His name is Vladimir Putin, and if his eight goals scored in a recent Russian All-Star hockey game are any indication, adding him to the roster could provide the Slavic solution for our ailing, first-round playoff-exiting Wings. He may even jump at the offer, seeing as our Wings are already Red.\J.A. McErlean\Farmington Hills\RPS helps the state\Eliminating Michigan's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) would pull the rug out from under the state's successful clean-energy economy. I oppose efforts to eliminate the RPS under consideration in the state Legislature because the RPS has been instrumental in securing numerous economic and environmental benefits.\The RPS has made the economy more competitive -- creating a demand to retool manufacturing facilities to build technology such as wind turbines.

In the absence of solid content that is grounded in the gospel and relevant to the real struggles of a conflicted world, entertainment will never take the place of engagement.

233,"Tom Walsh correctly asserts that Michigan lags behind other states in attracting alternative energy providers (""Big push for alternative energy jobs,"" Feb. 14.)\As competitive electricity providers in Michigan, we agree that a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) is a factor in achieving the multiple rewards that increased reliance on alternative energy brings: a cleaner, greener Michigan; reducing our collective carbon footprint; the attraction of even more innovators to help move Michigan's economy forward; and job creation.\What Walsh failed to mention, however, is the single most important element in attracting and retaining alternative energy providers: a competitive electricity environment. Perhaps this is because the governor already has put the wheels in motion to eliminate electricity competition.\Led by House Speaker Andy Dillon, D-Redford, the House is poised to return Michigan to a monopoly, with businesses and individuals again held as captive ratepayers by DTE Energy and Consumers Energy.\Walsh notes that testimony before the Michigan Senate showed that more than $9 billion was invested last year in wind-energy facilities in the United States, and of that total, 96% went to states with RPS.\Even more powerful: $9 billion for wind energy was invested in states that are open to choice in electricity providers. Alternative energy thrives in states with competitive electricity markets where stable regulatory and legislative policies are set.\Study after study has confirmed that competitive energy suppliers lead the way in the development of renewable sources of electricity. The evidence does not support the idea that Michigan can achieve advancements in reliability, conservation and renewable energy development by turning its back on competition and embracing regulation and monopoly utilities.\Terry S. Harvill\Vice President of Energy Policy for Constellation Energy,\Southfield\UNFULFILLED PROMISE\Tom Walsh was exactly right in his column calling on the Legislature and the governor to enact a comprehensive energy plan quickly. It is not enough to pass a bill requiring that a certain percentage of the electricity generated in Michigan come from renewable sources like wind. New base load plants need to be built in this state.\The problem is PA 141, passed by the Michigan Legislature in 2000, which attempted to bring competition to the electric industry.\I recently coauthored a study that concludes the promise of competition in this industry has not been fulfilled. The system is less reliable today, no residential customers benefited from alternatives, rates are going to be higher than necessary, and Michigan will be forced to buy additional power from other states.\Michigan is not alone in discovering this. About one-third of the states went down this path of deregulation, and all of them are experiencing the problems of high rates and difficulty in building needed power plants. Two of those states have already repealed their deregulation laws.\Michigan would be better off - in terms of rates, reliability, economic investment and jobs-if PA 141 were changed to provide the stability and certainty this industry needs.

Transforming Michigan to a new energy economy represents our single best hope for diversifying into new industries and creating tens of thousands of new jobs. Attracting new global investments, retooling our auto industry, and retraining an entire displaced workforce are perhaps the greatest challenges we have ever faced. It's also a tremendous opportunity that I've had the privilege of helping oversee as director of the new Department of Energy, Labor & Economic Growth, and as Michigan's Chief Energy Officer.
\
This transformation is driven by Michigan's abundant renewable resources, manufacturing experience, and skilled workforce. The overall catalyst is the remarkable alignment of Gov. Granholm's energy plan with that of the Obama Administration. We're working strategically with key agency partners including the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and NextEnergy to make Michigan a national leader in renewable energy and advanced energy technologies.
\
We're also working on the smart deployment of approximately $1 billion in federal recovery funds that Michigan stands to receive for energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. Michigan's new energy law established a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), requiring that 10 percent of the power utilities supply to customers comes from renewable sources such as wind, solar and biomass by 2015. An RPS is essential for Michigan's economic future because RPS standards drive investment And, with the governor's energy goal of reducing fossil fuels by 45 percent by 2020, we are aggressively pursuing advanced energy storage, wind, and solar deployment that will drive us toward 45 x 20, which according to the Center for American Progress can create more than 60,000 new jobs in our state.
\
The biggest opportunity for Michigan is advanced energy storage technologies and electric vehicle production; no other state is better suited. Armed with $555 million in refundable tax credits, we're aggressively attracting battery and research companies from around the world, including four companies that recently announced plans to invest more than $1.7 billion to launch advanced-battery manufacturing facilities here, creating 6,683 new jobs. Our strategy is to position Michigan globally as the advanced battery capital to ensure we remain the epicenter of auto technology for the 21st century. It means tens of thousands of new jobs and more than $18 billion for our economy by 2020. It puts Michigan in prime position to capture up to $2 billion in federal advancedbattery development grants.
\
Michigan is well on its way to becoming the renewable energy hub of North America. It already, has 11,000 more jobs in this growing sector than it did just four years ago. According to the latest annual Wind Energy Industry report, we were rated as the second fastest growing wind state; and federal studies rank Michigan among the top four states in industrial capacity to develop and manufacture wind energy systems. Our goal is to capture the entire value chain that will exponentially grow our jobs base. Since our partner, NextEneijgy, started matchmaking between Michigan companies and wind turbine manufacturers, more than $500 million in contracts have been signed with Michigan component suppliers. On the solar front, we're horde to the world's largest supplier of polyciystalline silicon, a key ingredient of solar panels. United Hemlock Semiconductor has had four expansions in Michigan, in as many years, with the most recent investment - a $1 billion facility near Midland, making Saginaw Valley the Midwest's Silicon Valley. We're also home to one of the world's leading thin-film solar manufacturers, United Solar Ovonic.
\
Underpinning all of these efforts to turn Michigan into the leading energy capital of the world is workforce development and job creation. Unlike other states that focus solely on the economic development aspect of the alternative and renewable energy sectors, Michigan is perhaps the only state to so aggressively focus on workforce development, targeting education and training of our workers to the work needed to help grow these exploding industries. The governor recently allocated $235 million for worker training across Michigan, including additional funding for the state's No Worker Left Behind program, which in year two, features the new Green Jobs Initiative, a $6 million investment in training for jobs in alternative energy industries including wind, solar, biofuels, geothermal and other green industries.
\
The Department of Energy, Labor & Economic Growth (DELEG), which aligns all of the state's energy and workforce development resources, is partnering with community colleges, entrepreneurs, and employers to create the training programs needed to help our new energy economy grow and make sure that energy jobs are created right here in Michigan.
\
In October 2008, Stanley ""Skip"" Pruss left his position as Gov. Granholm's special advisor on Renewable Energy and the Environment to become the director of the newly reformed Department of Energy, Labor & Economic Growth and was also named by Granholm as the state's Chief Energy Officer.

235,"
As Michigan's business and political leaders come together on Mackinac Island during the Uetroit Regional Chamber's annual Mackinac Policy Conference, their focus is clear: reigniting and growing Michigan's economy.
\
An important way to do that is to put in place a comprehensive energy policy to attract new businesses and move Michigan forward. That process is now under' way at the state capitol, and it promises to spur the state's fledgling alternative energy industry into the powerhouse that Gov. Granholm envisions. The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSCX supports this effort by promoting renewable energy through its policies, to the extent allowed under Michigan legislation, and by issuing technology grants that allow Michigan-based organizations to act as incubators of innovation.
\
A critical mass of alternative energy businesses already exists in Michigan:
\
* A wind farm is up and running in Huron County in Michigan's Thumb.
\
* Over two dozen manufacturers across the state already produce parts used in wind turbines.
\
* Michigan's United Solar Ovonic is a leader in the production of solar cells in Greenville, Mich.;
\
* Hemlock Semiconductor Corp. near Saginaw is the world's largest maker of polycrystalline silicon, the major material input used in solar panels and semiconductor chips; and
\
* Muskegon's Alternative and Renewable Energy Center (MAREC) continues to be a national leader as a demonstration center for using alternative and renewable energy technologies.
\
Michigan is ready to take the next step in attracting new alternative energy businesses. With a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) in the works, Michigan stands to benefit even more from alternative energy businesses. Many are poised to establish a presence in Michigan. The modest RPS under discussion in the Michigan Legislature has broad bipartisan support and moves Michigan in a positive direction.
\
It helps diversify Michigan's fuel mix, making it less dependent on fossil fuels; helps jump start the burgeoning alternative energy industry in Michigan, creating new, high-paying jobs; and will help improve the environment as our state's need for energy from existing coal plants can be diminished. With the appropriate legislative action in place, Michigan manufacturers will be supplying the parts and technology necessary to support renewable energy projects in Michigan, the nation, and around the world.
\
In addition to an RPS, several other actions by the MPSC are promoting the use of renewable energy and technology in Michigan.
\
The Commission has approved renewable energy programs that allow electric customers of eight regulated electric utilities to get part or all of their electricity from renewable sources. Thousands of customers have chosen to pay as little as $2.50 per month to support renewable energy in Michigan. This new demand for green power has spurred wind turbine projects around the state.
\
Electric customers also now have the option of offsetting their electric purchases and receiving a credit from the utility for any excess electricity generated from renewable sources, a process called net metering. The MPSC is currently considering rule changes to make it easier to interconnect with the utility and become a net metering customer.
\
Finally, the MPSC has promoted the use of alternative energy technologies through $24.7 million in energy efficiency grants. An additional $15 million will be awarded later this year.
\
One grant recipient is the MAREC center previously mentioned. The first facility of its kind in the world, it is a prototype distributed energy center, as well as a venture that will attract new businesses to Michigan. The MAREC building produces all the energy it needs to heat, cool, light and power itself. It is using fuel cells that turn natural gas into electricity, has a Michigan-made photovoltaic roof that turns sunlight into power, and has special Michigan-made batteries that store excess energy for use during periods of peak need.
\
Another premier MPSC grant recipient is NextEnergy, a corporation founded to advance Michigan as a leader in alternative energy. NextEnergy's microgrid demonstration project in Detroit is testing and demonstrating emerging alternative energy technologies, including renewable energy, fuel cells and combined heat and power systems.
\
And just this month, the MPSC announced more energy efficiency grants, including $5 million for a plugin electric hybrid electric vehicle pilot program awarded to a partnership of the University of Michigan, General Motors and DTE Energy. The MPSC wants to make sure that Michigan's electric grid is ready for the widespread use of PHEVs.
\
As the automotive capital of the world, Michigan is well-suited to capitalize on this technology. PHEVs give Michigan's auto companies a pivotal opportunity to retain and expand on their role as world leaders in automotive production, design and engineering excellence. And Michigan's two largest electric utilities - Detroit Edison and Consumers Energy - intend to begin deployment of advanced metering infrastructure in their service territories this year. The new metering technologies will enable many important improvements in electric grid operations, including the use of PHEVs.
\
The time is right for Michigan's utilities and automotive companies to move forward with integrating PHEVs into the electric grid in a way that enhances both, especially as gasoline prices continue to rise.
\
Projects like this are the result of making investments in great ideas and people who carry them out. The MPSC's grants have helped spur that on.
\
So, whether it is manufacturing parts of solar and wind projects, being a customer of renewable energy sources, or supporting the research and development or renewable energy projects and technologies, Michigan is ready to become the alternative energy business leader. The MPSC is doing its part to promote technology and programs that assist in reaching this goal.
"
236,"
The Detroit News appears to be entrenched in old world thinking on how or whether Michigan can help end the nation's dependence on foreign oil, help reduce global warming and, in the course of doing so, create jobs (""Put electricity needs ahead of wants,"" Nov. 10 editorial short, and Nolan Finley's Nov. 18 column ""Lot of wind in Granholm's energy plan"").
\
A new jobs report from the nonprofit American Solar Energy Society shows that not only are there 8.5 million jobs in renewable energy industries across the country today, but by 2030 there will be 40 million jobs related to some aspect of the renewable energy industries. Gov. Jennifer Granholm wants those jobs in Michigan.
\
The first step in this process is putting a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) in place for Michigan that sets a goal for how much our energy power providers generate from renewable sources like wind. Twenty-eight states have adopted such a standard, including Minnesota and Illinois which have said 25 percent of their power will come from renewable sources by 2025.
\
With an RPS in place, Michigan will be able to compete with the 28 other states that have them and are using them to attract job creators who are developing alternative energy technologies.
\
And renewable energy is cost-effective. Wind power is already less expensive than power produced from both new coal plants or nuclear plants, especially when you add in future costs of fuel sources, water and waste disposal.
\
Michigan is blessed with significant wind energy potential. We are confident that there will be many communities that will welcome wind farms like they have in Huron County.
\
The bottom line is that renewable sources -- such as wind, wood and waste -- can produce energy and jobs and that are critical to Michigan's future.

Thankfully, the state of New York has approved a bill requiring state of the art treatments of ballast tanks of ocean-going sea vessels through which invasives such as zebra mussels and sea lampreys have traveled.\Since all ocean-going vessels that enter the Great Lakes must pass through New York's waters, that state's new law will provide powerful protection against additional introduction of invasive species\Robert Gordon\Ann Arbor"

The federal stimulus package has a few bright spots for Michigan, including a 30 percent federal tax credit for small wind turbine investment. A similar 2005 tax credit expanded the solar industry, and Michigan has plenty of wind.
\
Changing the nature and source of energy consumption in this country is a national priority; that debate is over. This challenge requires a number of aggressive policy actions, but a federal solution is only half the battle. The bad news: Congress is losing that half for us.
\
The truth is, energy is everywhere, much of it is clean and renewable. But America has struggled to realize they are context-specific sources.
\
Most clean energy is not transportable - it is where it is - and it varies across the country. The sun is bright in Arizona; the wind is strong in the Great Lakes. We can burn coal and natural gas anywhere, but we can't ship wind and solar resources across the state.
\
By the way, Michigan consumes the eighth-highest amount of coal in America. Guess how much coal is mined in the state. You're right - none. That's billions of dollars we send outside the state every year to pay for that awful fuel.
\
Congressional leaders, for one reason or another, prefer their way of industry or fuel-specific subsidies and tax breaks, which has created an odd situation in which Congress is managing our nation's renewable energy portfolio.
\
This system is preventing us from running a country on clean energy. Remember when corn ethanol was supposed to solve problems? Yeah, good times. But we're still sending millions of federal dollars to the heartland for an unwanted fuel that is terrible for the environment.
\
Federal officials shouldn't write policy for specific fuels or sources. Congress can encourage contextualization of renewable energy generation by putting a national price on carbon and investing in the energy grid. States, local governments, and American entrepreneurs will take care of the rest.
\
When we get our price on carbon, the people who create our renewable energy portfolio will be those who produce and consume renewable energy.
\
This price on emitting carbon is actually in our near future, and it'll likely be monitored and tracked at a state level. One of the first things the president did in office was sign an order allowing a number of states to do this on their own. Ask any state or local official, the federal government often operates this way.
\
Believe it or not, the state government has laid some great foundations - a renewable portfolio standard and a lesser-known net metering program, encouraging disaggregated production of renewables. This is only the beginning, and far more aggressive approaches must follow.
\
A national carbon price is coming. State and local governments need to get ready for it with policies that are relatively ""fuel-blind,"" like an RPS, net-metering and perhaps even the politically unpopular system of feed-in-tariffs. We must cultivate every type of clean energy in every context in our state.
