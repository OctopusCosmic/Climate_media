0,AL,"Alabama Power eyes future renewable energy projects
",Dennis Pillion,"Sep 28, 2016","Alabama Power Company posted a request for proposals this week for renewable energy projects that could bring additional solar, wind, geothermal or other kinds of renewable energy to Alabama. 
\Alabama's largest utility has announced more than 90 megawatts of solar power projects since late last year, and John Kelley, Alabama Power's director of forecasting and resource planning, said the company wanted to weigh its options for additional renewable energy projects in the future.
\""Alabama Power supports renewable energy, where it makes sense for our customers,"" Kelley said in a news release announcing the RFP. ""Renewable markets change a lot, and this proposal gives us a chance to see what may be out there in the 2017 and 2018 time frame.""
\Last year the utility received approval from the Alabama Public Service Commission to develop up to 500 megawatts of renewable energy projects, and has since moved forward with a handful of those, including solar power installations at Anniston Army Depot and Fort Rucker and a 72 megawatt solar farm in Chambers County developed with Walmart.
\Those projects were planned with specific customers in mind, to meet the customers' renewable energy goals. 
\Walmart has a long-term goal of being supplied by 100 percent renewable energy, and aims to produce or procure 7 billion kilowatt hours of renewable power by 2020.
\The U.S. Department of Defense aims to offset 25 percent of the power used in all its facilities with renewable generation by 2025, and the Army, Navy and Air Force have been instructed to secure one gigawatt of renewable energy each.
\Alabama Power's RFP calls for several kinds of renewable projects including solar, wind, geothermal, tidal or ocean current projects, low-impact hydro, gas derived from sewage treatment processes, gas derived from solid municipal waste or landfill projects, hydrogen sourced from renewable resources, biomass materials and/or gases derived from biomass materials.
\The projects could range in size from 5 to 80 MW, and could be ""turnkey"" proposals that Alabama Power would own upon completion, or power purchase agreements lasting 10 or 25 years. In addition to its own resources, Alabama Power purchases substantial amounts of wind energy from facilities in the Midwest. 
\Alabama Power spokesman Michael Sznajderman said via email that any projects selected through the RFP process would count under the 500 megawatt certificate received last year. Individual projects would still have to be approved by the PSC.
\Notice of intent to bid must be received by 6 p.m. CDT on Oct. 14, 2016. Completed bids must be received by 6 p.m. CST on Nov. 15, 2016.

1,AL,"PSC approves Alabama Power's renewable energy project request, with modifications
",Dennis Pillion,"Sep 1, 2015","The Alabama Public Service Commission voted 3-0 to approve a proposal by Alabama Power to construct up to 500 megawatts of renewable energy generation projects in the state over the next six years. 
\Alabama Power spokesman Michael Sznajderman said the decision will allow the company to meet the demands of larger customers, primarily businesses and military facilities, that wish to add renewable energy to their portfolio.
\The projects will be designed to meet the needs of specific Alabama Power customers and could include, but would not be limited to, solar and wind installations of up to 80 megawatts each, or purchase agreements for renewable energy generated outside of the state. 
\""We've had some ongoing conversations with customers that are interested in renewable projects, some of the military bases among those,"" Sznajderman said. ""Now that we've gotten the PSC's approval, we can sort of move quickly to hopefully bring some of these together.""
\During a public hearing last month discussing the proposal, Alabama Power regulatory policy manager Noel Cain stated that the military and many Fortune 500 companies have instituted renewable energy mandates, and that having the ability to complete these types of projects will help attract businesses to the utility's service area. Cain said some customers have deadlines to meet their renewable goals, making time a factor. 
\Cain also said the customers involved would pay premium rates for the special generation and that the cost of the projects would not be passed on to the rest of Alabama Power's customer base. 
\The commission staff did include some modifications to the proposal as first submitted by Alabama Power, including requirements that the company submit generic requests for proposal on a biennial basis for projects submitted, that individual projects must be approved by a vote of the commission and limits that no more than 160 megawatts be submitted and approved in a calendar year, without a written request to the commission. 
\Sznadjerman said Alabama Power did not object to any of the modifications to the proposal. 
\Representatives from several conservation and green energy advocacy groups were on hand for the meeting and expressed optimism about the future of renewable energy in Alabama. 
\""We're excited that this has been approved and we look forward to working with Alabama Power and others to expand renewables in the state,"" said Conservation Alabama executive director Tammy Herrington. ""We think it's a good first step. We're excited to see what comes next.""
\Keith Johnston of the Southern Environmental Law Center said that he was pleased to see the commission approve the request, though he said there were lingering questions about the proposal that warranted review and further consideration. 
\""It's time that renewables have a place,"" Johnston said. ""We're still looking at the process, but the bottom line is we're happy that they're making this step forward.""
"
2,AL,"Alabama Power proposes up to 500 megawatts in renewable energy projects, including solar
",Dennis Pillion,"July 14, 2015","Alabama Power petitioned the Alabama Public Service Commission last month for permission to install up to 500 megawatts of renewable energy projects, including solar power, company spokesman Michael Sznajderman confirmed Tuesday. 
\Sznajderman said the company is seeking a way to provide renewable energy for corporate customers who desire it in their energy portfolio or have renewable energy mandates to meet. The proposal must still be approved by the PSC.  
\""This allows us to negotiate with these companies so that we can find ways to provide them with renewable energy, either by building our own projects, or possibly purchasing renewable energy from other sources,"" Sznajderman said.
\Sznadjerman said that the renewable electricity would come at a premium cost, which would not be passed on to the broader customer base, and that the program was not designed for residential customers, at least at the start. 
\""This is kind of a first step to try to work more aggressively with a portion of our customer base to provide renewables and predominantly solar,"" Sznajderman said. ""There's a growing interest in solar. The price has been coming down, but it's not quite to that point where it's at parity with conventional sources of power.
\""We're hoping that the Commission will give us this sort of broad ability to work with customers and get up to that 500 megawatt number.""
\The individual projects could be up to 80 megawatts each, but Sznajderman said that if the PSC signs off on the broader package, it would save the company from having to seek approval for each individual smaller project. 
\According to an announcement on Alabama Power's news site, 500 megawatts of solar power is roughly four to five percent of the company's total capacity.
\""This proposal provides a common-sense path for expanding renewables in Alabama,"" Nick Sellers, Alabama Power vice president of regulatory and corporate affairs said in the announcement. ""The Public Service Commission has been clear that they do not want renewables to be subsidized by all of our customers. This filing achieves that policy directive while also allowing for solar and new renewable energy projects that are expected to provide economic benefit for all of our customers."" 
\Alabama Power has previously lagged behind other regional utilities in solar capacity, even within its parent organization, Southern Company. Georgia Power, also owned by Southern Company, reported 900 megawatts of solar capacity and growing as of last year. 
\Keith Johnston, managing attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center -- who earlier this month co-authored a guest editorial on AL.com criticizing Alabama Power's lack of investment in solar energy -- said the announcement sounded like a positive step, although he would like to know more details about the proposal. 
\""Renewables are going to be a part of utility portfolios going forward,"" Johnston said. ""It's adding diversity to the fuel mix and it's adding jobs as we saw with Google up in north Alabama. I'm glad Alabama Power is finally coming around to seeing it that way.""
\Non-profit group Conservation Alabama released a statement Tuesday afternoon praising the proposal. 
\""This is the beginning of what we would like to see as a long-term change in how Alabama produces and uses energy,"" said Tammy Herrington, executive director of Conservation Alabama in a news release. ""Alabama Power is signaling their commitment to renewable energy, and we look forward to working with them to expand this program to make our state a leader in solar energy.""

3,AL,"When it comes to renewable energy, is Alabama closed for business?: guest opinion
",Andy Bowman,"Sep 2, 2014","For decades Alabama has been a jobs and investment juggernaut, one of the country's fiercest competitors for new industry.  The state can rightfully crow about its successes drawing new business in the auto, aerospace and aviation sectors, to name a few.  But one industry – renewable energy, one of the fastest growing in the U.S. and worldwide – won't be coming to Alabama any time soon, despite studies confirming Alabama's potential for wind and solar deployment.
\Alabama's business climate of late has been downright hostile for renewable energy.  One wind company tried to develop a project near Alabama's windy coast, only to see a special law passed banning wind projects in the whole county.   My company spent four years and $2 million developing wind projects in Etowah and Cherokee counties, only to come to the same end.  Two companies were sued recently just for planning a wind project in Cleburne County.  And solar is doing no better – Alabama's solar policies earned an ""F"" in one recent national comparison.
\Why is Alabama's business climate so bad for renewable energy?  In part because some elected officials are putting politics ahead of common sense.  Gadsden, the fourth poorest city in America in 2013, and Etowah County would have reaped millions of dollars in tax revenues and economic benefits from new wind projects, without a penny of state or local incentives – a big deal in the state that paid Hyundai $117,000 per job.  Instead, special laws were passed by local legislators making the projects impossible, in part because opponents couldn't stand that wind projects are eligible for federal tax credits.  The hypocrisy is breathtaking – this same group of legislators led the latest bailout, including $3 million from Etowah County taxpayers, of Goodyear's Gadsden plant which has failed for years to operate without taxpayer support. 
\Politics is a fact of life and we all know politicians will do just about anything to get re-elected.  Rather, it is the silence of those who know better that is the bigger reason why renewable energy is going nowhere in Alabama.  Not one of Alabama's business recruitment champions – the Governor's office, the Department of Commerce, the Business Council of Alabama – spoke up in defense of wind or solar investment.  Democratic leaders and most environmental groups supporting clean energy were also silent; apparently, they had higher priorities.  But this should be troubling for business leaders, because nothing says poor business environment like bad politics trumping good business, and everyone going along with it.
\Some can try to explain all this by saying that Alabama just doesn't like renewable energy: politically speaking, Alabama is a ""red"" state, Obama likes renewable energy, so therefore Alabama doesn't.  But clearly it is not that simple.  Fifteen Alabama businesses around the state already employ more than 100 people manufacturing wind and solar components (to be used elsewhere).  Neighboring ""red"" states like Georgia and Tennessee are plunging ahead with renewables.  Alabama Power, Georgia Power and TVA already buy large amounts of wind energy from other states, and Georgia is studying its off-shore wind potential.  Wal-Mart, one of Alabama's largest employers, recently agreed to purchase wind power from one of my company's Texas projects.
\Renewable energy is a big opportunity for Alabama.  It is happening already all around the country and in states right next door, and Alabama is getting left behind.  The situation will change only if people make their voices heard in support of clean energy investment.  
\Andy Bowman is president of Pioneer Green Energy.

4,AL,"Alabama A&M professor leading the charge in renewable energy
",Mike Kelley ,"Sep 1, 2014","HUNTSVILLE, Alabama -- Alabama may not yet be at the forefront of the renewable energy movement, but an Alabama A&M University mechanical engineering professor isn't waiting around.
\Dr. Showkat Chowdhury, who's been teaching mechanical engineering at A&M for the past dozen years, has launched a new series of courses this fall term aimed at getting engineering students geared up in the basics of renewable energy technology.
\""The energy crisis has just started, and we're not going to easily get out of it. Renewable energy is one of our best solutions.""
\Funded by a $300,000 National Science Foundation grant, the two new courses will ground A&M engineering students in the growing renewable energy field. They include:
\ME 441 Renewable Energy, a survey course touching on all renewable technologies:  solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, and hydroelectric. 
\ME 442, offered in Spring 2015, will take a deeper plunge into solar thermal, solar photovoltaic (i.e. solar electricity) and wind power.
\Both courses will have additional work options for graduate students.
\Chowdhury says the energy situation in the U.S. is bad and getting worse.
\ ""The energy crisis has just started, and we're not going to easily get out of it. Renewable energy is one of our best solutions.""
\About $100,000 of the grant has been used to buy renewable energy research equipment to support the course and Chowdhury's ongoing research.  A six-foot long wind tunnel will allow various windmill scenarios to be tested.
\ ""We can change the number of blades, the pitch of the blades, and wind velocity."" 
\A unique solar testing device will allow researchers and 15 student assistants to study how changes in solar radiation intensity and electrical loads affect solar energy output and efficiency.
\Chowdhury heads a energy research team consisting of himself as principle researcher assisted by his wife Tamara and fellow A&M engineering professor Dr. Wing Chen.

5,AL,"Finding the cool in the sun, renewable energy lab opens at Drake State
",Paul Gattis,"Jun 18, 2012","HUNTSVILLE, Alabama  --Monday's warm sunshine made for a cool morning at Drake State Technical College.
\The school formally opened its Renewable Energy Laboratory on campus, showing off a small house cooled by a two-ton unit operating solely on solar energy.
\""What was your first feeling when you walked in the door?"" said Ricky Willingham, director of workforce development at Drake State. ""This is cool. The sun is cooling this building. This sells itself.""
\Along with the renewable energy lab, the school also cut the ribbon on its original building that is now known as the Salon Management Technology Building.
\The ceremony included remarks from Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle, state school board member Mary Scott Hunter as well as Susan Price, chancellor of the state community college system, to a crowd of local business leaders and Drake State supporters.
\""The event today heralds Drake State's success at keeping pace with the rapid changes occurring in technology that impact America's quality of life and influence the workforce with increasingly higher levels of entry level skill requirements,"" said Helen McAlpine, president of Drake State.
\While the renovation of Building 600, the cosmetology building, is one of Drake State's largest programs and considered ""recession-proof,"" McAlpine said, the renewable energy lab was the crown jewel of Monday's activities.
\The lab isn't expansive -- perhaps the size of a large living room -- Willingham said it makes its point as a solar-sustaining building. It is not connected to the electrical grid, he said, and all energy is derived from the sun.
\In addition to the two-ton heating and cooling unit, the lab operates a 60-gallon water heater as well as powering lights and electrical outlets.
\The heating and cooling unit draws air from underground that is consistently about 55 to 60 degrees, Willingham said. That's much more efficient than cooling outside air on a 90-degree day or heating outside air on a 30-degree day, he said.
\The white lab, financed through a $458,000 Department of Labor grant and built to resemble a home complete with the details of a front porch and hanging baskets, will be used as a training facility. It also includes a charging station for electric cars.
\Willingham said 200 people are expected to undergo renewable energy training during the summer.
\""We're on the proactive, front side of it,"" Willingham said. ""A lot of time with training like we do, there's a need and we try to meet the need. (Renewable energy) is a buzzword. People in the program are either going to work as installers or they are going to be contractors.""
\So what does renewable energy mean for consumers? A greater cost on the front end, Willingham said, with significant savings on the back end.
\The cost in a home would be about $5,000 extra for each ton of a heating and cooling unit, Willingham said. Homes typically have heating and cooling units of about four or five tons. The savings, however, come in utility bills cut by about 50 percent.
\The renewable energy training offered at Drake State is also available cost-free, funded by the federal grant, Willingham said. Veterans looking for training are a target audience for the program as well as the unemployed or even contractors eager to learn more about renewable energy.
\""We spent a lot of time training to ascertain what's important for this community,"" McAlpine said. ""The renewable energy piece is something that's being talked about across the country.""

6,AL,"TVA ranked in top 10 nationally in renewable energy sales
",Brian Lawson ,"Jul 15, 2014","HUNTSVILLE, Alabama -- The Tennessee Valley Authority announced today it was ranked in the top 10 nationally for renewable energy sales among U.S. utilities in 2013.
\It marks the first time since 2003 that TVA has made the list. The utility cited customer support for its Green Power Switch program as a key reason for the sales performance listed ninth in the U.S. Department of Energy rankings.
\TVA was the only utility in the southeast to make the top 10. 
\Green Power Switch, which began in 2000, gives utility customers the option of buying a small amount of green power as part of their monthly bill. That money is then used by TVA to buy power from renewable sources – like solar and wind – in the Tennessee Valley.
\The program has grown, but only a small fraction of TVA's overall customer base has signed up. 
\TVA said it has 12,600 Green Power Switch residential or business customers. The utility serves about 4 million households in all or part of seven states.
\There are nearly 1,100 residential and 14 business Green Power Switch customers in Alabama. Those figures include 939 Huntsville Utilities customers, TVA said today.
\The program offers customers a chance to buy defined percentages of their estimated monthly electricity use from green sources, on top of their current rates.  A given home's participation doesn't mean green power goes directly to that customer, but rather to TVA's overall system.
\TVA offers six options, in blocks of 150 kilowatt hours – about one-tenth of a monthly power bill – for green power purchases, starting a $4 a month for 12 percent green power, up to $32 a month for 100 percent green power support.
\TVA spokesman Duncan Mansfield said solar power is the most common source for renewable energy purchased by the utility in the Tennessee Valley.
\He said there nearly 2,000 solar photovoltaic installations in the valley and TVA has approved 340 more that are ""on the way."" TVA will buy the power and offers incentive programs to encourage solar installations in homes and small businesses.
\""There is a great deal of activity on the side of (renewable  power) generators,"" Mansfield said. ""People want to sell their electricity.""
\TVA also has a program encouraging solar farms, that provided incentives for generation of up to 20 megawatts. The size of the program was increased this year, Mansfield said, and incentives for solar farms up to 100 megawatts are available.
\He said that program has four installations with 11 more applications currently.
\Mansfield said TVA will spend about $25 million this year to buy solar energy through the programs.
\TVA spends just over $460 million on renewable energy annually, Mansfield said, with much of that spending going to wind farm power purchases from providers in the Midwest, from states like Illinois and Kansas.
\TVA didn't find enough consistent wind available in the valley to expand aggressively into wind farms. The Midwest has proven to be a better region for that power, he said.
\Those purchases don't relate to the Green Power Switch program, but there are wind farms in the Tennessee Valley, with the largest site near Oak Ridge, Tenn. at Buffalo Mountain. TVA developed the site with three turbines, but it has expanded. Invenergy, which installed and runs the turbines, has installed 15 more turbines.TVA buys the power from the company.
\TVA is also working with a company called Strata Solar in the development of two joined wind farms in western Tennessee, Mansfield said.
\ The utility is currently working on its integrated resource plan -- its guideline for how it will generate power for the next years -- and Mansfield said the TVA board is expected to vote on the plan next fall. 
\ There will be public forums and other opportunities for public comment on the plan in the coming months, he said.

7,AL,"Public Service Commission hears testimony on proposed 500 MW renewable energy project
",Dennis Pillion,"Aug 12, 2015","The Alabama Public Service Commission heard testimony for more than three hours Wednesday about a petition submitted by Alabama Power seeking permission to offer up to 500 megawatts of renewable energy to its customers, either through new installations or purchase-power agreements with providers in other states. 
\The small-scale renewable energy projects would be up to 80 megawatts each, and could include new solar and wind energy projects, according to details of the proposal provided by Alabama Power. 
\According to Alabama Power, the proposal has specific customers in mind and would allow Alabama Power to serve those customers renewable energy at a premium price without increasing electricity costs for the rest of its rate-payers. 
\Noel Cain, Alabama Power's regulatory policy manager, testified at the public hearing that Alabama Power had been contacted by multiple customers, including military installations and private businesses, that are seeking the option to purchase renewable electricity for their facilities, and that the petition would allow Alabama Power to meet those needs. 
\Cain said that the military facilities were under a mandate to generate up to 25 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2025. She noted that many Fortune 500 companies, including Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Wal-Mart and others have similar internal mandates for renewable energy, and that offering renewable energy options would help to attract those kinds of businesses to the state. 
\She cited as an example the $600 million data center Google plans to build in Jackson County, Ala., which will be powered entirely by renewable energy.
\The petition did not disclose details about individual projects, which would be negotiated between Alabama Power and the prospective customers. Cain said that the deals would be only be executed that would show an anticipated ""positive economic benefit"" to all Alabama Power customers and putting downward pressure on rates. 
\Cain said the proposal could also help Alabama Power and the state of Alabama comply with environmental regulations like the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan, which was finalized last week, although she referred to compliance as a ""secondary benefit."" 
\The PSC is expected to include the petition on the agenda for its next meeting on Sept. 1. 
\""We're hopeful that the commission will find this proposal beneficial,"" Alabama Power spokesman Michael Sznajderman said after the meeting. ""Obviously we brought it to them thinking it is (beneficial), meeting a growing interest among our customers for renewables.
\""We believe this proposal gives us the flexibility to move quickly to meet some of the interest our customers have for renewables in a way that benefits not only them, but benefits our entire customer base.""
\Time is a key factor, as a federal tax credit for renewable energy is set to expire after 2016. Projects not completed by then risk losing the tax credit if it is not reauthorized by Congress. 
\Sznajderman said that since the announcement was made about the petition, the company has received additional inquiries from customers interested in purchasing renewable energy and from those interested in installing the projects.
\The plan was designed for commercial rather than residential power customers, but Cain testified that nothing in the proposal prohibited a community-scale solar project from being part of the project.
\Cain testified and answered questions by representatives from the PSC, Alabama Power, the Alabama Attorney General's office, and multiple private groups in Wednesday's hearing. 
\""We're really excited to see Alabama invest in renewable energy,"" said Amelia Shenstone, organizing manager for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. ""We know that that works in Alabama and we're really excited for it to start happening here.""
\The SACE was one of several groups sending representatives to the hearing to ask questions, including the Jobkeeper Alliance, the Alabama Environmental Council, and the Alabama Industrial Energy Consumers.
\""We appreciate the chance to participate in these hearings, and would like to continue the conversation about how Alabama can approach smart investments in clean energy,"" said Michael Churchman, executive director of the Alabama Environmental Council, which was represented at the hearing by the Southern Environmental Law Center.
\""While many questions remain about the details of the proposal, it is clear that utilities are acknowledging the energy shift already underway and the cost-savings and benefits that come with renewables like solar and wind."" 
\""As evidenced by Google's decision to expand into northern Alabama's TVA territory, we are witnessing an increasing demand for clean energy options from business leaders,"" said Keith Johnston from the Southern Environmental Law Center.  ""Our hope is that Alabama Power will take this opportunity and make renewable generation a more widely used and available resource, while also making sure those energy decisions benefit customers across the state.""

\It can make a difference in getting that first job, officials at Calhoun Community College and Drake State Technical College say. Presidents and program directors at both schools say the energy training programs and training facilities put in place in 2012 have paid off big for their graduates.
\""We had area contractors coming to us and saying they need graduates with training in renewable energy,"" says Drake State President Dr. John Reutter.  ""We're seeing more future jobs that require energy training.""
\""We had area contractors coming to us and saying they need graduates with training in renewable energy.""

Packed into the lab's 800 square feet is control and monitoring equivalent for a large geothermal loop and the roof-mounted solar array.
\Solar power, just beginning to catch on in north Alabama, uses a ""photovoltaic"" process to convert sunlight shining on solar panels into electrical energy. A geothermal loop uses the ground's constant temperature for heating and cooling.
\Calhoun Community College, with campuses in Huntsville and Decatur, has also been quick to jump into renewable energy training. Motorists passing the main campus on U.S. 31 north of Decatur can hardly miss the large 100 kilowatt solar array adjacent to the Alabama Center for Excellence in Clean Energy Technology. The center provides HVAC students additional training in renewable energy technologies such as photovoltaic, geothermal, and wind power.  
\Calhoun's Applied Technology in Renewable Energy program graduates about 30 students per year, says program director Jerry Adams. Students also get specialized training in industry-focused classes such as the ""building envelope tightness verifier"" class, which trains students in the fast-growing field of building energy tightness.
\Energy knowledge gives students an edge when looking for work with Huntsville area contractors. Jim Batson of Huntsville's H.C. Blake Co. says today it's all about home performance. ""That helps us give better value to our customers. Some customers are very concerned about how tight their homes are, and employees who understand that help us.""
\All Season's 1-Hour Heating and Air Conditioning wants employees who know something about solar and geothermal as well as basic air conditioning. New standards for HVAC ducting require workers who understand the new requirements. ""The students who know this are more valuable to us,"" says manager Todd Little.

9,AL,"Southern Co. enters sixth solar deal with Ted Turner's Turner Renewable Energy
",Stan Diel ,"Nov 5, 2013","BIRMINGHAM, Alabama – Southern Power, a subsidiary of Southern Co. (NYSE: SO), has agreed to acquire a 20-megawatt solar facility in California in partnership with Turner Renewable Energy.
\The acquisition of the Adobe Solar Facility will be the sixth for the partnership. The deal, the terms of which were not disclosed, is expected to close when construction of the facility is completed in the spring, Southern Power said in a prepared statement.
\Southern Co. CEO Thomas Fanning said the deal reflects the company’s commitment to developing a “full portfolio of energy resources.”
\The company has added more than 1,700 megawatts of renewable energy resources since January, 2012, Fanning said.
\The new facility, being built on 160 acres in Kern County, Calif., will be operated by SunEdison.
\Turner Renewable owner Ted Turner said in a statement that his company is dedicated to the development of renewable energy.
\""Renewable energy is playing an increasingly important role in meeting America's energy needs,"" he said.
\Last week Southern Power announced it had begun commercial production at its Campo Verde Solar Facility, which also is a joint-venture with Turner Renewable.

10,AL,"More solar panels pop up on South Parkway; 50kW system producing about $14,000 in annual renewable energy
",Paul Huggins  ,"Apr 3, 2013","HUNTSVILLE, Alabama -- The solar panels that began rising two weeks ago on South Memorial Parkway are already on line and producing renewable energy for the Tennessee Valley Authority.
\The 50kW system located just north of Charlotte Drive passed inspection last week as part of TVA's Green Power Providers program, said Chris Shearburn, owner of Southern Solar Systems, the Huntsville company that installed the panels.
\It's the second highly visible solar system to begin operating in South Huntsville in the past year. The Redstone Park and Energy Demonstration Center at the northeast corner of Airport Road and South Memorial Parkway went up last spring to showcase market-ready technology.
\Shearburn said the system he just installed was part of the initial phase of a TVA program that paid 12 cents above the current hourly retail rate, which he noted has now been reduced to 9 cents. The 20-year TVA contract agrees to pay the above retail rate for 10 years and then pay a retail rate the second 10 years.
\Combined with 30 percent federal tax credits and depreciation tax credits, the system should pay for itself in six to seven years, he said.
\A 50 kw system can cost between $3 to $4 per watt based on the type, location and complexity of the installation, Shearburn said, so normal price range may be from $150,000 to $200,000.
\""With prices dropping, we are beginning to see some systems start to come in under $3/watt at this size for simple installations,"" he said.
\A 50 kw system will produce about 70,000 kwh or $13,000 to $14,000 per year under the current TVA Green Power Providers program. The average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 11,280 kWh in 2011, meaning the South Parkway panels could support about seven homes for a year.
\The system comes with a 25-year warranty, so with the TVA guaranteed price, it looks like it would be a popular choice by commercial businesses.
\But it's not as simple as it sounds, Shearburn said, because it has significant up-front costs and it's not easy to get financing for it.
\""For a commercial business to wait six to seven years to get its money back, that's a long wait,"" he said, noting paying off a residential system could take 10 years.
\Southern Solar has been in business since 2007 and since has seen most of its solar business in Tennessee, particularly farming operations. Tennessee saw rapid expansion of solar systems, Shearburn said because it offered a variety of incentives to spur development.
\Alabama has never offered state-sponsored incentives, he said, but solar systems are slowly catching on because equipment prices dropped, particularly on silicon used in the construction of solar modules.
\""The bottom fell out on silicon prices,"" Shearburn said, explaining since 2007, the cost for each solar module dropped from $4.20 to 70 cents.
\Southern Solar didn't disclose and owner of the system. Madison County property records show the land belongs to Joe Aaron Fleming and Louis Strong Fleming. Attempts to reach them were unsuccessful.

",Brendan Kirby ,"Jul 9, 2014","U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne on Wednesday unsuccessfully sought to eliminate funding for a renewable energy initiative. The White House threatened to veto the bill because of more modest cuts to the program.
\The veto threat issued Wednesday comes as Congress debate the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2015. The White House expressed its displeasure with a proposal to spend $546 million less than the administration proposed for the Department of Energy's Office of Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
\Byrne, R-Fairhope, argued that the cuts do not go far enough. He said the program unwisely spends money on alternative energy sources that are costly and make up only a tiny fraction of the nation's energy needs.
\""At a time when our economy continues to recover and many Americans continue to struggle to make ends meet, including paying their energy bills, we must focus on reasonable energy strategies that allow for the most affordable and reliable energy resources for consumers and businesses alike,"" he said on the House floor.
\The House, which rejected Byrne's amendment, is expected to vote this week on the $34 billion spending bill. The bill funds the Department of Energy, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and provides money for some Interior Department programs and several independent agencies, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
\The veto statement issued by the White House on Wednesday said the administration is ""strongly opposed"" to the cut.
\""This reduced funding level will stifle Federal investment in innovative clean energy research and development (R&D) at a time of significant global competition and progress,"" the statement reads.
\The White House also indicated that the bill would excessively restrict nonproliferation contacts with Russia and prevent the development of lower-cost methods for disposing plutonium waste. In addition, the White House said, the bill would put the nation's nuclear-powered fleet at risk and jeopardize the Navy's ability to train nuclear-qualified sailors.
\The administration did express appreciation for the bill's ""support for offshore wind technology demonstrations and for the Clean Energy Manufacturing Innovation Institutes.
\But Byrne argued that program allows the government to invest millions of taxpayer dollars on ""high-risk research-and-development schemes"" for green energy projects that have a low chance of paying off.
\""The government should not be subsidizing the research-and-development initiatives of individual companies,"" he said. ""Competition and innovation have been key aspects of private sector success from day one, in the energy sector and other parts of our economy, and the government should not take the role of the private investor.""
\Byrne cited examples of a $2.5 million grant to a Massachusetts company to work with Green Mountain Coffee to reduce the energy used in roasting coffee beans, and millions of dollars given to large chemical and auto companies. Ford Motor Co., for instance, received a subsidy to develop a new sheet metal forming tool.
\""Now I have nothing against those companies, but why should the government be picking and choosing winners and losers?"" Byrne asked.

12,AL,"7 questions with John Christy and Roy Spencer: Climate change skeptics for 25 years
",Paul Gattis,"Apr 1, 2015","A chart put together by John Christy, director of the Earth System Science Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, that reflects how the temperature satellite data (the green line) contrasts with temperature models.Paul Gattis | pgattis@al.com 
\The silver anniversary of Roy Spencer's career-defining moment arrived with no expectation in March. He didn't realize it until someone mentioned it to him.
\For John Christy, he had no idea that a discovery announced in 1990 would not only still resonate 25 years later but would be at the center of a raging debate.
\The date was March 29, 1990. That was the day - though unbeknownst to either Christy or Spencer - they publicly became climate change skeptics.
\The scientists at the University of Alabama in Huntsville are known throughout the environmental community as being skeptical that climate change (or global warming) will have a catastrophic effect on the earth. The crux of the matter is that their research, using satellite data to measure temperatures in the atmosphere, disagrees with climate models they say that overstates the earth's warming.
\""We are in the minority, there's no question about that,"" Christy said.
\Yes, they agree, that there is climate change. Yes, they agree, humans play a role in that climate change. No, they agree, it's not a catastrophic event.
\""We had no clue at that time, 25 years ago, we would be in the center of a huge controversy almost 25 years to the day with congressional investigations, the secretary of state, the vice president telling us we don't even believe in gravity,"" Christy said. ""Who would have thought that 25 years ago?""
\Still, they carry on - comfortable in their research and data that has remained true to their findings 25 years ago.
\What Christy and Spencer (who then worked for NASA at Marshall Space Flight Center just down the street from UAH) announced at that press conference on March 29, 1990, was that their study of temperature data from satellites indicated the world was not warming as much as was believed.
\These days, such an opinion is ridiculed from President Obama on down.
\""I think we knew it was going to be an important new way of monitoring the climate,"" Spencer said. ""But you just never know if something like that is going to have legs scientifically. Whether somebody will come up with a new way of doing it better in two years.
\""Looking back, I'm kind of surprised this is still the leading way of doing this. Really our only competitors in the field have the same answer we do, very close to the same answer.""
\AL.com recently sat down with Christy and Spencer for extended interviews as the anniversary approached. Here are excerpts of those conversations:
\AL.com: So how did this research get started?
\Spencer: John came here to work on a different project. It wasn't too long after he came here that we were at a meeting -- I think it was in New Hampshire -- and we were discussing things over lunch. And the subject came up, Hey, don't we have satellites? Jim Hansen (a climate scientist who sounded perhaps the first alarm about climate change in the 1980s) had just done his testimony for Al Gore in Congress. That's sort of when global warming became public knowledge, when Hansen testified. We were discussing, Don't we have something better than the thermometer data to monitor global temperatures? (UAH scientist) Dick McNider said, 'What about the microwave sounders we have on the weather satellites? We got back to Huntsville and we started looking at how we could get all that data."" 
\AL.com: President Obama recently said that Republicans are going to have to change their opinions on the dangers of climate change. Is this a partisan issue?
\Christy: Numbers are numbers. That's what we produced. Those aren't Republican numbers or Democratic numbers. Those are numbers. Those are observations from real satellites. Roy and I were the pioneers. We discovered how to do this with satellites before anyone else did. You can see this very strongly in the administration. Secretary of State John Kerry comes out and says it's like denying gravity. The attack on skeptics was ramped up in the past month. It was a very orchestrated plan having the congressional investigation (by U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Arizona).
\AL.com: How do you respond to the perception that 97 percent of scientists agree on climate change? (The Wall Street Journal in 2013 reported on the ""myth"" of the 97 percent).
\Christy: The impression people make with that statement is that 97 percent of scientists agree with my view of climate change, which typically is one of catastrophic change. So if a Senate hearing or the president or vice president says 97 percent of the scientists agree with me, that's not true. The American Meteorological Society did their survey and they specifically asked the question, Is man the dominate controller of climate over the last 50 years? Only 52 percent said yes. That is not a consensus at all in science.
\Then when you look at the core of that question, the core is do you believe that man has some influence on the climate. I don't know anyone who would say no to that. Who are the 3 percent who didn't agree with that? Roy and I have both made the statement that we are in the 97 percent because we believe in some (man-made) effect. It wasn't quantified and it wasn't this dangerous thing. That wasn't part of the question.
\Spencer: Whoever came up with that, it was very powerful. It was a good idea. It was very misleading, but it was a good idea. There are different ways people handle that. I use the angle that based on the way they come up with the 97 percent, John and I could be considered part of the 97 percent. This is where things get all muddy. They call us global warming deniers. It's a great soundbite except what do we exactly deny? Or the science is settled. OK, what science is settled? You never hear the specifics.
\""That's the great thing about politics. People throw out these platitudes and you could read into them whatever you want. It's so generic or non-specific in the thing that they're saying that you can interpret it anyway you want. You turn it into your own thing because you fill in the details. So being a global warming denier, the truth is we don't know global warming. The science is settled? Well, some of it is. Adding CO2 to the atmosphere probably adds some warming. The science on that is pretty solid. But then the devil's in the details. How much warming does it actually cause? It makes a huge difference.
\AL.com: When you hear about the catastrophic effects of climate change, data from reputable organizations such as National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) or NASA is frequently cited. How do you respond to that?
\Christy: NASA, NOAA, EPA, DOE, those are agencies. Agency leaders are appointed by the government, by the current administration. They do not represent objective independent scientific organizations. They can't. They are appointed by the head. They try. People who come out with different views in their organizations are found to be squashed. There is an agenda in those agencies, so it does not surprise me when they go full bore on something like climate change. They are marching to the drum of the administration. It's always been that way. But this administration has been extremely opaque. When you try to go provide information to EPA like these pictures, they will just dismiss it. They will come up with their findings and will not provide you with background for information so that you will know they made a scientific finding.
\There are skeptics in NASA and NOAA, a good number. But they are quiet. They know in this administration, they don't speak out.
\Spencer: I know that they're not unbiased. Most of them probably really do believe we're destroying the earth. When I talk to scientists who should be objective over a beer at the end of the day, I will argue with them and their final position will always be, 'Yeah, but we need to get away from fossil fuels anyway.' Where did that come from? Are you an expert in alternative energy sources and what they cost? How many poor people are you going to hurt? How many more people are you going to make poor through energy poverty because they are paying five to 10 times as much for their energy?
\These guys in government are not unbiased and they have pressures from above. Those organizations, NASA and NOAA, they are part of the executive branch. So the White House has some influence over what direction they go. The heads are political appointees so you have political influence from the top down on scientists. And that's a problem.
\AL.com: What about the value of renewable energy sources?
\Christy: I am for any energy source that is affordable and doesn't destroy the environment. If carbon dioxide was a poisonous gas, I'd be against it. Carbon dioxide makes things grow. The world used to have five times as much carbon dioxide as it does now. Plants love this stuff. It creates more food. CO2 is not the problem.
\Why would you go to wind energy that is so much more expensive or solar? The point here is that if it's not economically sustainable, it's not sustainable. And you have to have an energy plan that's sustainable, that people can afford. Right now, wind and solar, you can't afford. And so the only wind and solar that exists is because of huge government subsidies.  I'm not against renewables or any other source of energy. Can we afford it? Solar and wind are so low density that it takes acres and square miles to do anything. And that's not environmentally smart.
\There is absolutely no question that carbon energy provides with longer and better lives. There is no question about that. Anyway scientific way you toss that. Any scientific way you toss that question, you come out that people live better and longer lives. And to suppress, to me, is immoral.
\AL.com: Why is your research using satellite data a more effective way of measuring climate change than surface temperature? After all, humans live on the surface, not in the upper atmosphere.
\Christy: Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. When you put more of it in the atmosphere, the radiation budget will respond appropriately. It's just that what we found with the real data is that the way the earth responds is to shed a lot of that heat, not keep it in, which climate models do. So I'd rather base policy on observations than on climate models.
\Where is the biggest response to greenhouse gases? It's in the atmosphere, not on the surface. So if you want to measure the response and say that's the greenhouse gas response, you would look in the atmosphere. That's precisely where satellites measure it. So the scientific to how does the world respond is found here. The response of the climate system is stronger in the atmosphere than on the surface.
\AL.com: What's it like to be labeled as a ""denier"" of the dangers of climate change?
\Spencer: I don't mind being defined that way. I've done other research that I've published and I always get a little pushback on, Why are you dabbling in that? You're supposed to be in global temperature monitoring. Because of us doing the satellite temperature dataset, people expect that's all we can do. And they pigeonhole you and expect you to stay in that.
\I've come to terms with and accepted that this is the most important thing probably I'll be known for. I have to keep doing it, which I don't mind. On the positive side, I could have just been an average researcher who never did anything of note. So I feel blessed to be in the position that I'm in.

13,AL,"Alabama climate change skeptic believes shots 'targeted' his office floor
",Lee Roop,"Apr 25, 2017","Dr. John Christy, Alabama state climatologist and atmospheric science professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, points to bullet holes in the side of the building containing his office. Christy believes the floor he works on may have been ""targeted"" by people objected to his prominence as a climate change skeptic. (Lee Roop/lroop@al.com)
\Nationally prominent climate change skeptic Dr. John Christy believes his office floor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville was ""targeted"" by gunshots over the national March for Science weekend.
\""To me, it looks like the fourth floor was targeted,"" Christy said Tuesday. The pattern of the damage ""does raise the possibility it was a little more than a coincidence,"" he said.
\However, UAH police think the shooting was a ""random, isolated"" act. They found cartridge casings beside Sparkman Drive in front of Cramer Hall, where Christy's office is on the fourth floor. Bushes and trees between the hall and the street make it likely someone wanting to shoot from the street into the building would aim at the top two floors, they said.
\""UAH police are investigating an incident where seven bullets struck Cramer Hall on the university's campus while the building was unoccupied sometime between Friday night and Monday morning,"" the university said in a statement today. ""Investigators believe the incident to be a random, isolated event unlikely to be a premeditated act. Anyone with any information about this crime is encouraged to email the UAH Police at police@uah.edu.""
\The university police say they found no relevant images from campus security cameras or the cameras at a nearby defense contractor. They have marked the case ""inactive"" pending new information.
\Cramer Hall is a complex of two large buildings connected by a glass connector. A total of seven bullet marks were visible in the sides of both buildings and the glass connector Tuesday. One went through a window in the office next to Christy's.  
\Christy's colleague and fellow climate change skeptic Dr. Roy Spencer, whose office is also in the building, posted to his blog about the shooting.
\""Given that this was Earth Day weekend, with a March for Science passing right past our building on Saturday afternoon, I think this is more than coincidence,"" Spencer wrote.
\""When some people cannot argue facts, they resort to violence to get their way,"" Spencer wrote. ""It doesn't matter that we don't 'deny global warming'; the fact we disagree with its seriousness and the level of human involvement in warming is enough to send some radicals into a tizzy.""
\Spencer said all of the bullets hit the fourth floor, but UAH Chief of Staff Ray Garner said some shots hit the third floor. Garner also the science march did not pass Cramer Hall, but started farther south at Shelbie King Hall.
\Police say they found seven 5.8 x 28 mm cartridge casings beside Sparkman Drive after being called to the scene Monday morning by a colleague with the office next to Christy's. She found a large hole in her double-pane window and broken glass on the floor when she arrived for work. Police recovered bullet fragments inside the office.
\The 5.8 x 28 mm cartridge is a small, high-velocity round used in military and police weapons around the world.
\The shots made national news on some outlets including the Breibart website, because Christy is one of the nation's best-known skeptics of the science behind many climate change predictions. He testifies frequently before Congress including as recently as March 29 before the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space & Technology.

14,AL,"Climate change? Alabamians in Congress bet on doing nothing
",John Archibald,"Nov 2, 2016","Three words for Alabama's Congressional Delegation.
\Are. You. Sure?
\Are you willing to bet the future of your kids and mine? Are you sure enough to risk the planet on the word of a few status quo-backed scientists? Are you willing to go down in history - if there is to be such a thing -- as leaders who had power to save so much, but instead turned away?
\Turned away, as the story will be told, to count pieces of silver from energy interests?
\Are you sure?
\A group that monitors the politics of climate change - the Center for American Progress Action Fund - this year created a list of 182 ""climate change deniers"" in Congress. Alabama Sens.  Jeff Sessions and Richard Shelby were on the list. So were Reps. Robert Aderholt, Mo Brooks and Gary Palmer. That's 55 percent of the state's delegation.
\I wanted to know what they really thought, so I asked the whole delegation to explain their positions on climate change. Only the named ""deniers"" got back to me. Only Brooks got back in person.
\Brooks said he does not deny that climate changes, because earth has always changed. He said there are many factors, and humans are one. But he questions past data, argues that public opinion is tainted by faulty ""climate scares,"" and recommends more study because action must be balanced against cost.
\Does he worry that he could be - dare I say it -- wrong?
\""I worry about a lot of public policy issues,"" he said. ""The climate change issue is on the list. But it's a long list.""
\Aderholt's office referred me to an op-ed the congressman wrote for the Jasper Daily Mountain Eagle - a newspaper in coal country - way back in 2010.
\""I fall into the second group of people who believe, as do many very credible scientists, that the earth is currently in a natural warming cycle rather than a man-made climate change,"" he wrote.
\Denier.
\Congressman Gary Palmer's office issued this statement: ""I am a firm believer in sound science. There have been new findings that clearly show the science is not settled on climate change.""
\Equivocator.
\Shelby's office said ""the Senator's position is that any action on this topic must follow a robust economic analysis and have the consent of Congress to ensure the appropriate balance between protecting our environment and the effects on our economy.""
\I don't even know.
\And Sessions' office referred me to his statements in the Congressional Record from 2015, which questioned models used by ""global climate change advocates.""
\The models ""predict not only increasing temperatures but increasing droughts, increasing flux - droughts and flux - increasing severe weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes,"" Sessions said then. ""These models have long predicted this. ... A critical measure of the validity of any model is how well it compares to actual data. So the actual weather data, I tell my colleagues, is proving that the models have not been accurate.""
\Which might sound better if we weren't in the throes of the second hundred year drought in a decade, if the world weren't in a wash of fires and storms that many scientists believe were triggered by climate change.
\Temperature is objectively rising, carbon dioxide is definitively increasing in the atmosphere, trapping warmer temperature on the planet, and we produce the carbon dioxide by burning all the fuels we burn.
\Scientists overwhelmingly agree that climate change is caused in part by humans, yet - according to that ""Climate change denier"" study - some 60 percent of Americans are represented by politicians with their heads stuck in the sand.
\Because the science is ""not settled.""
\What is settled is where Alabama's congressional delegation's bread is buttered.
\The Southern Co., the parent company of Alabama Power, is by far the leading contributor to Alabama campaigns for Congress, having given $825,458 to current senators and representatives, according to Opensecrets.org. Add other energy interests - and lawyers who represent them -- and the number tops $2 million.
\Alabama Power Spokesman Michael Sznajderman said his company has worked to reduce greenhouse emissions, lowered its use of coal and is embracing more use of solar power.  But he defended the political contributions.
\""We believe it is important to be involved and engage with our public officials when there are issues on the table that can affect our customers, potentially affect the energy prices our customers pay, or affect Alabama's economy,"" Sznajderman said.
\Which is all well and good.
\As long as Alabama's public officials can forget about the cash when they look at their children. As long as they can look their grandchildren in the eye and honestly say to themselves:
\""I'm sure.""
\Are you sure?

\A big one. In granite or marble, with names etched so deep they'll last a millennium. If we have that long.
\A monument to Alabama Public Service Commission President Twinkle Cavanaugh. That's right. And to U.S. Reps. Mo Brooks and Robert Aderholt. To Sen. Richard Shelby and darn near the whole congressional delegation.
\A monument to recalcitrance and opportunism. A monument to willful ignorance and blatant disregard for the future.
\A monument that stands for future generations like a big stone reminder of who is to blame.
\Yeah that's right. A marker naming for eternity those who could have stood up for the future, but instead stood for doing nothing as the earth's climate changed.

\It's not about this spate of hurricanes. It's about a bigger picture in which the department of defense has made plans to deal with the effects of climate change, in which - this according to NASA -- more than 95 percent of scientists agree that warming is caused by humans.
\But what it's about is not the argument. What it's really about is being a good steward of the planet, in being people as eager to invest in our children's earth as we are in their education and trust funds.
\Pope Francis said it best last week when he urged skeptics to talk to scientists.
\""Climate change is having an effect, and scientists are telling us which path to follow,"" he said. ""And we have a responsibility -- all of us. Everyone, great or small, has a moral responsibility ... we must take it seriously ... history will judge our decision.""
\As if on a monument.
\That's the Pope. But you don't have to be a Christian to see it. The Dalai Lama said much the same, that humans made this mess and it's not enough to pray to God or Buddha to make it go away.
\""This is not a question of one nation or two nations. This is a question of humanity,"" he went on. ""Our world is our home. There's no other planet where we may move or shift.""
\Feel free, of course, to disagree.
\Hope and pray and decide there's little you can do. Deny the whole thing and argue that we just can't know enough to know. Stand for nothing but the status quo.
\Feel free. But know, when you do, that you're buying a spot on that monument. So be sure.

16,AL,"Climate change down on the Alabama bayou
",Regina M. Benjamin,"Sep 10, 2017","A man walks by a shrimp boat tossed upon a dock by Hurricane Katrina, in Bayou La Batre, Ala. The storm left dozens of shrimpers atop docks and marshes in the town, where about 75 of homes were damaged or destroyed.(Associated Press)
\Alabama's 230-year old shrimping village of Bayou La Batre - of Forrest Gump fame - lies within a fragile network of bays and salt marshes and is vulnerable to sea level rise. Its shores sit just five feet above sea level on Alabama coastal soil that is slowly, but surely, being covered by water. 
\In 2005 Hurricane Katrina brought a 16-foot storm surge that left a trail of gutted homes and seafood processing plants, along with shrimping boats capsized and stranded in the pine trees. Despite recent efforts to build a mile-and-a-half long protective breakwater on a small island south of Bayou La Batre, large areas of coastal marsh continue to erode. 
\The waters of the Gulf of Mexico are warming more rapidly than similarly sized bodies of water, and for the first time on record, this past winter the waters did not cool. As we just experienced this past month with Houston's Hurricane Harvey, future hurricanes will use this additional heat to intensify, become stronger and produce storm surges that go further inland, causing more damage.  Just as water heated in a pot to a boil expands and bubbles over, Gulf waters are expanding as they warm, contributing to sea level rise.  Melting waters from the distant ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica also add to this rise in sea level. 
\The economy of Bayou La Batre's seafood industry, including our once-plentiful oyster harvest depend on a balanced ecosystem.  Torrential rains can flood the marshes with too much fresh water and kill the oysters.  On the other hand, too little rain can raise the salt content of bays and estuaries, which will attract snails that drill into the oysters and eat their flesh.  Also with warmer waters and higher salt levels, oysters are more likely to carry Vibrio vulnificus, a bacteria that can cause serious skin, and gastrointestinal infections, making the oysters unsafe to eat. 
\There are health effects as well.  A combination of greater humidity and higher temperature can increase the potential for heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and even heat-induced death.  As we experience warmer Gulf Coast winters, mosquitoes and other insects are at greater risk of carrying diseases such as Zika, West Nile, and Dengue.  Locals have recently noticed more swarms of termites; one swarm was so thick it delayed a little league softball game. 
\Whether you believe in global warming or not, and regardless of your politics, something is happening to our Bayou and other coastal communities.  Last month, the governor of Louisiana declared the disappearance of their coast a national emergency.  Changes to the environment are no longer far from home, or someone else's problem.  It is happening in our own backyard, along our coasts, and in our Bayou, affecting our lives and our livelihoods.
\As we pursue a more humane and just society, each of us has the responsibility to protect our planet for future generations.  Pope Francis said it succinctly in his 2015 speech to the United Nations,
\""The ecological crisis, and the large-scale destruction of biodiversity, can threaten the very existence of the human species, .... Any harm done to the environment, therefore is harm done to humanity.""

17,AL,"Alabama will require students to learn about evolution, climate change
",The Associated Press,"Sep 13, 2015","Alabama is updating its decade-old science standards to require that students understand evolution and learn about climate change, topics that can still be controversial in the Bible Belt state.
\Educators say the new rules -- part of a major change that includes more experimentation and hands-on instruction and less lecturing -- don't require that students believe in evolution or accept the idea that climate is changing globally.
\But public school students will be required for the first time to understand the theory of evolution. And teachers will be required to address climate change, which wasn't a focus the last time the state set science standards in 2005.
\The new standards take effect in 2016 after being unanimously approved by the Republican-controlled Alabama State Board of Education on Thursday.
\No one spoke against the new standards when they were discussed at a board meeting in August, but supporters praised them as a step forward for the state.
\A 40-member committee that developed the new course of study included people with ""very strong religious beliefs"" who considered the state's faith traditions and worked together to develop the new guidelines, said Michal Robinson, science specialist for the state education agency.
\""We still have to teach what the science is,"" Robinson said in an interview Friday. ""If students want to go into a science field in college or beyond, they have to have a foundation.""
\The current state standard says students ""should understand the nature of evolutionary theories,"" but such knowledge isn't required.
\The new standard goes further, stating in the preface: ""The theory of evolution has a role in explaining unity and diversity of life on earth. This theory is substantiated with much direct and indirect evidence. Therefore, this course of study requires our students to understand the principles of the theory of evolution from the perspective of established scientific knowledge. The committee recognizes and appreciates the diverse views associated with the theory of evolution.""
\Steve Ricks, director of the Alabama Math, Science and Technology Initiative, said the biggest changes under the new standards are the teaching methods that will now be used in science classrooms.
\Rather than relying solely on lectures and memorization of facts from textbooks, teachers will now be required to let students figure out things on their own through observation and experimentation, just like real scientists.
\""I don't see how students would be able to learn this material without doing the science,"" he said. ""We are trying to teach kids to reason and solve problems.""
\The state course of study only sets minimum standards. Local school officials will still make curriculum decisions.
\Textbooks used in Alabama science classes have carried a disclaimer sticker for years stating that evolution is a ""controversial theory,"" not fact, and the new course of study doesn't change the warnings, which were advocated by Christian conservatives.
\A committee that will review science texts could consider whether to remove or alter the stickers, officials said. A public hearing is set for Nov. 9 in Montgomery.

18,AL,"2 UAH professors take national stage to dispute climate change science, rebuke John Kerry
",Paul Gattis,"Feb 20, 2014","HUNTSVILLE, Alabama -- Two University of Alabama in Huntsville professors used a national platform today to fire back at comments U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry made in a recent speech regarding climate change.
\In an opinion piece today on The Wall Street Journal website, Richard McNider and John Christy took issue with ""consensus science"" in the climate change community that belittles differing points of view. The McNider/Christy commentary is posted under the headline: ""Why Kerry is flat wrong on climate change.""
\Christy, a longtime dissenter on some of the most commonly-accepted theories of human influence affecting climate change, is the director of the Earth System Science Center at UAH and the state of Alabama's climatologist. McNider is a distinguished professor of science in the ESSC.
\McNider and Christy were responding to remarks Kerry made Sunday in Indonesia in which Kerry, according to the UAH professors' commentary, said, ""We should not allow a tiny minority of shoddy scientists"" and ""extreme ideologues to compete with scientific facts.""
\McNider and Christy maintain in their commentary that climate change scientists who believe the earth is on a catastrophic path to global warming frequently shape their research and conclusions to fit that narrative.
\The UAH scientists also caution against the dangers of consensus-building focusing on one scientific perspective to the exclusion of other opinions and research.
\""'Consensus' science that ignores reality can have tragic consequences if cures are ignored or promising research is abandoned,"" McNider and Christy wrote in The Wall Street Journal commentary. ""The climate-change consensus is not endangering lives, but the way it imperils economic growth and warps government policy making has made the future considerably bleaker.""
\The UAH scientists concluded their commentary by firing back directly at Kerry.
\""We should not have a climate-science research program that searches only for ways to confirm prevailing theories,"" McNider and Christy wrote, ""and we should not honor government leaders, such as Secretary Kerry, who attack others for their inconvenient, fact-based views.""

19,AL,"Conservatives make case for market-based approach to tackling climate change
",Dennis Pillion,"Oct 17, 2016","As a conservative-leaning independent, Peter Bryn believes the government should play a limited role in the lives of its citizens, only getting involved where absolutely necessary to safeguard the lives and rights of its citizens. 
\As a former engineer for ExxonMobil and current conservative outreach director for the Citizens' Climate Lobby, Bryn believes that reducing carbon pollution that leads to climate change is one of those areas.
\""I was with Exxon for about eight years, and I was concerned about how we manage climate change and provide energy to the world affordably at the same time,"" Bryn said. ""I'm a big believer in the policy approach that Exxon supported, which is very similar to what we at CCL support, which we call a carbon fee and dividend."" 
\Bryn and other representatives of the Citizens' Climate Lobby are touring the Southeastern states of Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and Louisiana this month as part of the group's Southern Energy Freedom Tour to make the case for their policy, which they see as a market-based approach to battling climate change that is preferable to increased regulations from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
\The tour kicked off in Alabama with an event at Saint John's Episcopal Church in Mobile Thursday night, before heading to Pensacola Friday. The CCL tour will meet with church, civic or college groups in Dothan, Auburn, Montgomery, Tuscaloosa, Birmingham and Huntsville over the next several days. 
\Bryn said the CCL is a strictly non-partisan group that understands the importance of building conservative support for their proposals.
\That can be tricky business when many prominent Republicans, including GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, have expressed skepticism or outright denial that carbon emissions are contributing to climate change, despite a large body of scientific evidence pointing to that conclusion.
\""When we talk about climate, what a lot of conservatives hear, or what we've traditionally heard in the past, is kind of a big government solution, a bunch of regulations, new taxes, all that kind of stuff,"" Bryn said. ""It has traditionally been I think, a lack of policy options that align with the ideals of conservatives that has really kind of, strangely enough, backed itself into skepticism that there is a problem in the first place.
\""That's not the right way to deal with it, but nevertheless, that's what's happened, I think.""
\Bryn also believes there is a generational gap in climate skepticism among Republicans. He cited surveys and focus groups conducted by the College Republican National Committee showing clean energy and climate change to be among the top priorities of young voters. 
\""I think that there are a lot of younger conservatives that want their party to be relevant on this,"" Bryn said. ""And what they're hungry for is a solution.""
\The Citizens' Climate Lobby's solution involves three basic steps. First, setting a price on carbon that escalates over time in a steady, predictable, transparent manner. 
\Next, the group proposes returning the fees collected to U.S. households equally through what the CCL calls a dividend check. Bryn said that would help offset increased fuel costs, and for many would serve as an economic stimulus, if the households receive more than they spend in higher fuel prices. 
\""First we like it because it doesn't grow the government,"" Bryn said. ""Second, we like it because it protects low- and middle-income households from cost of living increase.""
\The third step would be to impose a tariff on imports from countries that do not have a comparable price on carbon and a rebate for American-made goods exported to those countries. Bryn said that would level the playing field for American manufacturers and motivate other nations to adopt similar policies to avoid the tariff. 
\""That sends a pretty clear signal to other countries that it makes sense to follow 
\suit,"" Bryn said. ""Having said that, of the top 10 world economies, we're one of just three countries that have not enacted a national carbon price legislation.""
\In a move that can't hurt in the appeal to conservative voters, many of the tour events will be held at churches, as religious leaders locally and worldwide have shown interest in proactively addressing climate change. 
\The Rev. Thomas Heard, pastor at Saint John's Episcopal Church in Mobile, said he was happy to let his members use space in his church for a meeting with the Climate Lobby. 
\""According to one of the creation accounts, humankind was to be given mastery, by one translation, over the Earth and all its creatures,"" Heard said. ""We were supposed to take care of it. We were supposed to be good stewards over that incredible bounty that God had given us.""
\Heard also said environmental pollution has a well-known impact on human populations, and especially the poor.
\""You can't look at London in the Industrial Revolution or Pittsburgh during the steel era, or China today, with all the industrial pollution and think it doesn't matter,"" Heard said. ""It certainly has an effect on the climate and the people, and what we do here affects other places.
\""It's motivated out of our sense of needing to step up our stewardship, if it's not too late.""
\The tour's Oct. 19 stop in Birmingham is being co-hosted by eight different faith groups: First United Methodist Church; Alabama Faith Council, Birmingham Islamic Society, Birmingham Shambhala Meditation Center, Episcopal Diocese of Alabama Task Force for Stewardship of Creation, Greater Birmingham Ministries, Justice Committee of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Birmingham and Temple Emanu-El.
\The CCL's Southern Energy Freedom Tour will make the following stops in Alabama:
\Dothan -- Saturday Oct. 15, Shoney's Restaurant, 12-1 p.m.
\Auburn -- Sunday Oct. 16, Unitarian Universalist Fellowship, 4-5 p.m.
\Montgomery -- Monday Oct. 17, Unitarian Universalist Fellowship, 7-8 p.m.

20,AL,"'Very bad tick year' expected for Alabama in 2017, and climate change a factor
",Dennis Pillion,"Apr 11, 2017","2017 could be a record year for ticks and tick-borne illnesses according to one researcher who studies the arachnids in Alabama. 
\""I would say this is going to be a very bad tick year because it was a very mild winter,"" said Tim Sellati, chair of Southern Research's Infectious Diseases Department. 
\The warm, wet winter and spring have created conditions for dense undergrowth in forests, which allows ticks to thrive. 
\In addition, Sellati said a warming climate has let certain species of ticks expand their range and those changes are reflected in tick surveys in Alabama and other parts of the United States.  
\""The winters are warmer and the ticks recognize this, they sense this change in their environment,"" Sellati said. ""We are seeing, year over year, ticks migrating into areas they would not normally venture into.
\""The ticks take advantage of this change in climate that allows them to expand their range. When ticks expand their range, they also increase the likelihood of coming in contact with humans.""
\You can get Lyme disease in Alabama 
\There's a persistent myth that Alabama doesn't have Lyme disease or the ticks that carry it, but Sellati and others say that is absolutely false. 
\Alabama has both the black-legged tick (often called the deer tick) and the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi. 
\Sellati said that biological surveys conducted by Auburn University show the most common tick in Alabama is the lone-star tick, with adults carrying a distinctive white spot on their back, but Alabama also has black-legged ticks, American dog ticks and Gulf Coast ticks in the southern part of the state.
\The most commonly found ticks in the Southeast are (clockwise from top left) the black-legged tick (commonly called deer tick), the American dog tick, the lone-star tick, and the Gulf Coast tick.
\Sellati said it may just be a matter of knowing where and how to look for the ticks. The more aggressive lone-star ticks may respond better to the most common method of tick sampling, which is to place dry ice (carbon dioxide) on a white sheet in the woods and wait. The ticks are attracted to the CO2 from the dry ice and can easily be collected from the white sheet. 
\When researchers collected samples from deer, they predictably found more deer ticks than lone-star ticks. 
\The genetics of Lyme disease
\While entomologists track ticks in the wild, and the Alabama Department of Public Health collects data on tick-borne illnesses, Sellati and his team at Southern Research are interested in how genetics impacts a person's reaction to the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. 
\Sellati said 20 to 30 percent of people who are infected with the Lyme bacteria, show no symptoms or complications whatsoever.
\""It's as if they weren't even infected, but they were,"" Sellati said. ""Their immune system has the ability to recognize that bacteria, kill it and clear it very effectively.""
\Fifty to sixty percent show the trademark bullseye rash, as well as arthritis, carditis, nervous system effects, or other symptoms, but are treated with antibiotics and show no permanent ill effects.
\The remaining 20 to 30 percent, even if they receive the same antibiotic treatment as the majority group, experience symptoms that persist even after their treatment.
\""The combination of their immune response and the antibiotics is not enough to eliminate the symptoms of Lyme disease,"" he said. ""These individuals have a significant decrease in their quality of life after infection."" 
\Sellati said there is still debate among the scientific community as to whether this happens because the antibiotics don't completely kill the bacteria, or whether permanent damage was done before the antibiotics were administered. 
\Regardless, Sellati said he is working to understand whether genetic differences could be responsible for the varied reactions to the bacteria. 
\Sellati said he has identified one strain of mouse that develops a ""very severe Lyme arthritis,"" and another strain that exhibits ""very mild if any symptoms"" when exposed to the Lyme-causing bacteria. 
\""This gives us a beautiful model to study the genetics of these mice and what makes them so different in how they respond to the bacteria,"" Sellati said. ""We're starting to understand these key genetic differences that influence the severity and the persistence of the symptoms. 
\""So we can test drugs in mice that will complement their immune response, which is lacking, and hopefully these new drugs will help those individuals that are predisposed to developing those Lyme disease symptoms.""
\Sellati said the researchers could be close to identifying genetic markers that would lead to better treatments for the 300,000 people diagnosed with Lyme disease diagnosed each year in the United States. 
\""When you go to your physician with a tick bite, we could test you rapidly to see whether antibiotics alone are likely to kill and clear all the bacteria,"" Sellati said. ""Or does your genetic profile suggest that antibiotics are not going to be enough.""

21,AL,"Ex-Marine: America needs to focus on the enemy of climate change
",Joshua Morgan Folmar,"Jan 20, 2016 ","""To locate, close with, and destroy the enemy...""
\Those words--describing the mission of the Marine Corps rifle squad--are as engrained into an infantry Marine's psyche as the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor, and the scars on our bodies. Yet we have learned firsthand in Iraq and Afghanistan that our 21st century enemies are not as easily recognizable as those of past generations: no uniforms, no clear territorial lines. But does that prevent us from accomplishing our mission?
\No. The mission of the Marine Corps rifle squad is ""to locate, close with, and destroy the enemy by fire and maneuver"" (emphasis mine). And so we have. By adapting and learning to recognize the signs--the IED wire sticking out of a sandbag, the abandoned market during the busiest hour of the day, or the sound of a hollowed wall or floor where a weapons cache is buried--we have been able to fight the enemy that hides in plain sight.
\So why should it be any different with the dual threats of climate change and oil dependence? Seven years ago--long before I understood the global reach of what the Department of Defense calls a ""threat multiplier""--I saw one aspect of this enemy, on patrol in Iraq, firsthand. Whether it was protecting the hydro-electric dam in Haditha or hunting down the source of the black market oil trade in Iraq, it was painfully clear that our dependence on oil was a weakness, and I would soon begin to recognize the signs of our faceless global enemy.
\The first time I truly saw the dangers of climate change, though, it didn't come in the form of record high temperatures, though my hometown in Alabama saw theirs in 2007 as I was training in California to go to Iraq. Nor did it come in the form of the plunging lows that I have experienced since moving to my adopted state of New Hampshire in 2013.
\Instead, I saw the effects of climate change firsthand on Wednesday, April 27, 2011, when one of the worst tornado outbreaks in history destroyed large portions of my state, including my neighborhood and home of six years in Tuscaloosa. By the end of those three days of unnatural disaster, 355 people were dead (64 in Tuscaloosa alone). If one of the six trees that went into my home had blown less than a foot to the right of where it landed, my roommate, a Navy veteran, would have been number 356.
\So I ask our candidates and their constituents to adapt to this enemy that is threatening our national security. Climate change and oil dependence will continue to create conflict until we are eradicated unless we face this enemy head-on. Common-sense solutions, such as the Clean Power Plan and the #50by30 initiative to use at lest 50% renewable energy by 2030, are a step in the right direction for strengthening our nation's security.

22,AL,"Donald Trump's outlook on climate change could help economy, Alabama expert says
",Paul Gattis,"Nov 25, 2016","The opinions of President-elect Donald Trump on the issue of climate change have varied dramatically over the years.
\Most recently, though, Trump fervently campaigned on the stance that any increase in global temperatures were not the result of human influence.
\Of course, in an interview earlier this week with The New York Times, Trump said there may be some connection between increasing global temperatures and humans.
\John Christy, the director of the Earth System Science Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and a renowned skeptic on human influence of climate change, said that the position Trump took during his campaign could help improve the economy.
\Christy spoke to AL.com before Trump's interview with The New York Times.
\""We can only talk about intentions right now,"" Christy said of Trump's views on climate change. ""We don't know what is actually going to happen. The intentions are to roll back the regulatory activities that have been going on the last four years or so. Now as a scientist, I can say I don't have any problem with that because we can test the impact of these regulations and they will have no impact on the climate. They are so tiny to what happens globally.
\""But they will have a pretty strong economic impact. And I think that's what the president-elect is going for - he's very concerned about the economic effect and get those regulations off, that that would really help the economy.""
\Christy has long said that, even if humans are influencing climate change, the impact of the United States is virtually non-existent.
\""Let's make the United States disappear - no more people, no more cars, no more factories,"" said Christy, echoing testimony he has given in hearings before Congress. ""And the climate models tell us the impact of global temperature will be just a tiny fraction - you couldn't measure that fraction hardly at all, it's so small. That then tells you the United State isn't the big player.
\""It's what's happening in China, it's what's happening in India and the rest of the developing world. They are going for carbon as their source of energy and quite rapidly.""
\Christy said he has studied the data himself, confirming the lack of influence the U.S. might have on possible climate change. And that makes the regulations reducing carbon emissions, pushing the country away from cheap energy such as coal and oil, costly to the economy for no apparent benefit.
\""When you look at what these regulations will actually do to the climate system - and we've done that actual work,"" Christy said. ""I've presented in federal court and no one rebutted the numbers, it will have a minuscule effect. You can't even attribute anything to these regulations as having an environmental effect.""
\Christy pointed to China as being among the world leaders in fossil fuel production. A report earlier this year by Forbes confirmed that perspective, though the magazine said that China is being more efficient in its coal burning and has also increased its clean energy production.
\India is another country producing far more carbon emissions than the U.S., Christy said. A report earlier this month by The Economic Times said India is planning to double its coal production by 2020.
\Trump has also promised to remove the U.S. from the Paris Accord, which 196 countries signed last year in what was hailed as a landmark document addressing the effects of climate change.
\""That's more optics than anything,"" Christy said. ""If you remember, the Paris Accord was only signed by the president as an agreement. It does not have force of law because it was not approved by the Senate. So President Trump can just withdraw the signature or ignore it. It's only an agreement the previous president made. (Trump) doesn't have to go along with it.""

24,AL,"Alabama climatologist Dr. John Christy questions Pope's take on climate change: guest opinion
",Dr. John R. Christy,"Jun 22, 2015","The issuance of Pope Francis' encyclical (Laudato Si', ""Be praised"") addressing climate change last week was intriguing to me -- a climate scientist involved in the contentious issue of global warming, yet one who holds a seminary degree with former service as a missionary in Africa. Science and faith cross paths often in my world.
\Frankly, I'm puzzled by this encyclical. The language it uses to describe our current world is frightening, ""The exploitation of the planet has already exceeded acceptable limits."" According to the document, we are ""witnessing a disturbing warming ... an increase in extreme weather events.""
\Are we doomed to an apocalyptic disaster befitting the biblical calamities described in the Revelation of John? The encyclical seems to think so.
\And the reason? People want to live longer and better lives.
\'We are not morally bad people for taking carbon and turning it into the energy that offers life to humanity...'
\And there's the dilemma.
\On the one hand, the encyclical calls for renewed attention to the ""wisdom"" that all human life is sacred, having ""infinite dignity."" Each of us is ""a thought of God ... willed, ... loved, ... necessary."" Non-catholic Christians around the world can say ""Amen"" to that.
\On the other hand, we are asked to forgo the fundamental means by which human life flourishes today - carbon-based energy (coal, oil, natural gas). Why? ... because the by-product of this energy, carbon dioxide, must be ""drastically reduced"" to thwart a theorized ""... extraordinary climate change and an unprecedented destruction of ecosystems.""
\But what has this ""exploitation of the planet"" wrought? Simply put - human life, in both length and quality. Carbon is the most affordable and reliable source of energy in demand today, renewables like solar and wind are neither by comparison. This is why over 85 percent of energy comes to us from carbon and why its use is growing around the world. This will not stop anytime soon.
\Scientifically, I will admit that the complexity of the climate system baffles me. But I'm not alone. The hundreds of millions of dollars spent to understand the climate system though computer modeling (on which the catastrophic claims are based) have yet to generate results that give us confidence that dangerous warming will occur.
\I am one of those climatologists who builds datasets so we can measure what the climate system is doing and why. In my reading of the results, I don't see disasters ahead - the world's atmosphere has warmed little since satellites began estimating global temperatures and extreme events like droughts and hurricanes aren't increasing.
\To be sure, others see it differently. However, I tend to focus on the fundamental metrics that, according to theory, should be measurable if the extra carbon dioxide we are emitting into the atmosphere is actually causing huge changes. The real world simply doesn't align with the theory. Whether you are a Baptist (like me), a Buddhist or a Baha'i, the numbers come out the same ... and ""science"" is all about the numbers.
\The moral question is differently addressed. In science we measure things, but we cannot take a human life to the laboratory and measure its real value. Here is where the Pope, my Catholic friends, and I stand together by understanding that our faith is the source of our belief (yes, belief) that human life is of infinite value.
\Therefore, we are not morally bad people for taking carbon and turning it into the energy that offers life to humanity in a world that would otherwise be brutal (think of life before modernity). On the contrary, we are good people for doing so. As the Indian Environmental Minister P. Javadekar stated in 2014, ""The moral principle ... cannot be washed away. India's first task is eradication of poverty ... our first priority"", so that ""... our CO2 emissions will rise.""
\When I look at the scientific results I and others generate, and then hold fast to what my faith earnestly speaks, I view sensible carbon-use as today's liberator of precious humanity from the dangerous vagaries of nature. Carbon becomes, therefore, a positive moral imperative to consider.

25,AL,"Audubon study: Climate change threatens half of North American bird species, including eagles, pelicans, turkeys
",Dennis Pillion,"Sep 9, 2014","A National Audubon Society study seven years in the making warns that nearly half of all North American bird species will have their habitats severely restricted or altered due to climate change over the next several decades. Popular species like the bald eagle, osprey, brown pelican, wild turkey, mallard and white-breasted nuthatch are among the 314 species projected to lose at least 50 percent of their current range by the year 2080.
\""The greatest threat our birds face today is global warming,"" Audubon chief scientist Gary Langham said in a news release. ""That's our unequivocal conclusion after seven years of painstakingly careful and thorough research.""
\A team of National Audubon Society ornithologists, led by Langham, used decades of bird-watchers' observations and climate data to establish climatic and seasonal requirements for 588 species of birds native to the United States and Canada.
\They plotted those requirements against the United Nations' projected climate change estimates for the years 2020, 2050 and 2080 to determine where those birds might still find the temperature, precipitation and seasonal conditions they need.
\Of the 588 species in the study, 126 were designated as climate-endangered, meaning at least 50 percent of their current winter or summer habitat is projected to fall outside the range of acceptable climate conditions by the year 2050 with no net gain from range expansion. Another 188 species are designated as climate threatened. These birds are projected to lose half their current range by 2080, but have the potential to shift into new areas. 
\When climate conditions force birds to shift their habitat, there is no guarantee they will be successful in doing so. Conditions like land use, plant cover, human development, elevation and access to the sea could impact a species' ability to find new habitat that also meets its climatic requirements. 
\""It's alarming that nearly half of the birds that regularly occur in the U.S. could be imperiled by climate change,"" said Melanie Driscoll, the National Audubon Society's director of conservation for the Gulf Coast and Mississippi Flyway, which includes Alabama. ""That's bad news for birds, and as birds have always been indicators of our environmental health and the resources that are available to humans, it's not good news for human communities either.""
\Driscoll said that Alabama could see reductions in familiar ""backyard"" species like the hairy woodpecker or white-breasted nuthatch, and game species like the wild turkey.
\""What the data is telling us is that the overall climate in Alabama will become much less suitable for turkeys by 2080,"" Driscoll said. ""For the turkeys (by 2080) Alabama is no longer really within its ideal zone, so I would expect they would become either much less abundant, would be seen much more rarely, or would just survive or reproduce poorly.
\""They could be rare to missing in Alabama by 2080, which is just astonishing for a bird that we consider to be so ubiquitous in the U.S.""
\Some of the large birds listed as endangered or threatened by climate change -- bald eagles, brown pelicans, ospreys -- suffered severe population declines attributed to DDT pesticides before the chemical was banned in the U.S. in 1972. Numbers have rebounded for all three species, but all three are expected to see a climatic range shift in the decades ahead.
\""It's sobering to see changes this study predicts for some of Alabama's favorite backyard birds, game birds that are currently part of successful conservation efforts, and resident birds that contribute to the strong nature-based tourism industry here,"" said Suzanne Langley, executive director for Birmingham Audubon Society.
\The report is not just about doom and gloom, however. Langley said the group hopes that by identifying the species that are most likely to be displaced by climate change, Audubon can better target conservation efforts for individual species. 
\""From our perspective, we work toward conservation and we can restore habitat, if we are over-hunting or poisoning our birds, we can change our behavior,"" Langley said. ""But it is deeply troubling to see, based on this modeling, what impact climate change is going to have.""
\Maps are available on the Audubon Society web site in .gif form, showing each of the 314 endangered or threatened species with its observed range in the year 2000, and the estimated ranges for the years 2020, 2050 and 2080.

26,AL,"Should Exxon Mobil be held responsible for misleading the public about climate change?
",The Tylt,"Aug 29, 2017","A Harvard study says Exxon Mobil has been misleading the public for 40 years about climate change. Despite internal research warning that climate change is real and a threat to its business, Exxon Mobil conducted a huge campaign to sow doubt about climate change. Some want the company to be held responsible for its actions -- like how Big Tobacco held responsible for spreading misinformation. But Exxon Mobil says it did nothing wrong and the accusations are false. What do you think?
\PERSPECTIVES
\A Harvard study went through 40 years of internal communication at Exxon Mobil and compared it to the scientific studies researchers published. The authors of the study found that Exxon Mobil was quietly researching the dangers of climate change and how it would affect its business at the same time it was loudly conducting a campaign to discredit climate change. 
\To address worries that information was cherry-picked to prove a point against Exxon Mobil, researchers looked all the data available. This means researchers examined all of the released Exxon Mobil internal communication as well as everything Exxon Mobil researchers published. Here's what they found:
\Their content analysis examines how 187 company documents treated climate change from 1977 through 2014. Researchers found that of the documents that address the causes of climate change, 83 percent of its peer-reviewed scientific literature and 80 percent of its internal documents said it was real and man-made, while the opposite was true of the ads. The researchers analyzed ads published in the New York Times between 1989 and 2004. In those ads, 81 percent expressed doubt about the scientific consensus, tending to emphasize the ""uncertainty' and ""knowledge gap,"" while just 12 percent affirmed the science.
\Exxon Mobil is facing investigations in several states, as well as a class-action lawsuit from shareholders. Exxon Mobil should be held responsible for their actions. Like the tobacco industry, the company willfully spread lies for its own profit. Like the tobacco industry, Exxon Mobil should pay up. 
\Harvard study: Exxon 'misled the public' on climate change for nearly 40 years
\ExxonMobil said it did nothing wrong. The company argues this campaign is part of a conspiracy against ExxonMobil conducted by the Rockefeller family. In fact, many of the investigations alleging ExxonMobil did something wrong were funded by descendants of John D. Rockefeller. 
\The company is attacking the role of the Rockefeller family in encouraging, and in some cases bankrolling, the investigations and campaigns against it. Both journalism organizations that investigated the company were financed, at least in part, by Rockefeller philanthropies, though the organizations say that their donors have no control over what they write.
\The key thing to note is that Exxon Mobil didn't bury its research. Exxon Mobil scientists have been published in over 50 peer-reviewed studies on climate science. Exxon Mobil didn't keep any secrets. According to Michael Gerrard, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia, people have to prove that Exxon Mobil willfully hid information.
\It's not enough to show that Exxon had internal knowledge of climate change when external knowledge was widespread. The government would have to show that there were things that only Exxon knew and that were material to investors and that Exxon kept from investors. Such evidence might be there, but we don't know yet.
\Can Exxon Mobil be found liable for misleading public?

",Kyle Whitmire,"May 13, 2014","Perhaps we in the media owe you an apology. Maybe it's our fault.
\One in four Americans are strongly skeptical when it comes to climate change. No matter the research, evidence and the scientific community's consensus that climate change is real, man-made and a threat to the future of humanity, some folks just don't want to believe it, and they'll cling to that sliver of climate change denial like it's a tall tree branch in a flash flood.
\On Sunday night, TV funnyman John Oliver blasted Americans for our ambivalence. But more to the point, Oliver blamed the American media for perpetuating a debate that has been over for more than a decade.
\(And you thought we were done with smarmy Brits brow-beating us, just because CNN fired Piers Morgan.)
\""I think I know why people think this issue is still open for debate – because on TV, it is,"" Oliver said. ""And it is always one person for, one person against.""
\American media try to be ""fair and balanced,"" to borrow that old saw from Fox News, but rather than presenting ""debates"" in proportion to the evidence and expert consensus underlying them, media have been lazy – falling back on a he-said/she-said style of Crossfire-like entertainment that lazily presents different sides of an issue with false equivalence. There's always two sides to every story right? Well, that's what you're given, no matter if there's three, four, a hundred or, in the case of climate change, just one.
\Last week, the federal government released the National Climate Assessment, emphasizing present-day effects of climate change, and already the United State Department of Defense is planning around climate change, which it sees as a reality, not a debate, and as something that could destabilize the world, leading to new conflicts.
\As the Associated Press explained last year, that degree of consensus means scientists are as certain about climate change as they are that smoking is bad for your health, but too often the media give it the same odds as a coin toss.
\""More often than not, it's Bill Nye the Science Guy versus some dude,"" Oliver said. ""When you look at the screen, it's 50-50, which is inherently misleading.""
\So what did Oliver do? He gave a mathematically fair and balanced debate – with three climate change skeptics on one side, and Nye and 96 other scientists on the other.
\""It's a little unwieldy, but it's the only way you can actually have a representative discussion,"" Oliver said.
\So if the ""debate"" over climate change is a media invention, let me say on behalf of all of us, our bad. Sorry.
\But it's not only the media. A major problem with the climate change ""debate"" is that the effects seem so far off that it falls into that bag of long-term problems we could fix today, but would rather dealt with after it's too late. 
\There's a whole host of issues in that same mix, with tabs that will come due a long time before the Statue of Liberty needs a snorkel -- entitlement reform, underfunded pensions, the deterioration of national infrastructure, etc.
\You see, all that business politicians like to jabber on about leaving a better world for our children and dire warnings about this being the first generation not to be better off than the one before – it's all bunk. Again and again, we're Wimpy from Popeye --  we'll take that hamburger today, which the next generation will not-so-gladly pay for after we're dead. Dealing with immediate issues while ignoring or minimizing distant ones until it's too late isn't the aberrant behavior of our generation. It's the default function of our species.
\But let's assume for a second that maybe climate change is real but not caused by us, or that we're too stubborn to do anything to prevent it. We still have to deal with the effects – rising sea levels, more erratic weather patterns, unpredictable crop yields, etc.
\""More often than not, it's Bill Nye the Science Guy versus some dude. When you look at the screen, it's 50-50, which is inherently misleading.""
\(If two papers published this month predicting the inevitable collapse of the West Antarctica ice sheet prove correct, that's exactly what we're dealing with – at least a 10 ft. rise in sea levels, which is now inevitable.)  
\At the very least, shouldn't we invest in some sandbags?
\In Sweet Home Alabama, we convince ourselves that the best way to fight the future is to stubbornly live in the past.
\Kevin Harrison, the transportation director for the South Alabama Regional Planning Commission, explained to the Bloomberg news service that, when pitching flood mitigation and infrastructure reinforcement to public officials in Alabama, it's best not to mention climate change, or public officials will tune you out.

\The EPA findings involve ""six well-mixed [greenhouse gases] that together represent the largest driver of human-caused climate change: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride."" 
\The findings released Monday do not include small, piston-engine planes or military aircraft, but were called ""an important step"" before adopting domestic greenhouse gas engine standards on the types of large engines used on commercial airliners.
\""Addressing pollution from aircraft is an important element of U.S. efforts to address climate change,"" said Janet McCabe, EPA's Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, in a news release. ""Aircraft are the third largest contributor to GHG emissions in the U.S. transportation sector, and these emissions are expected to increase in the future.
\""EPA has already set effective GHG standards for cars and trucks and any future aircraft engine standards will also provide important climate and public health benefits.""

Protected and expanded were NASA's development of a big new deep-space rocket and missions to other planets.
\Republicans on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, including bill co-sponsor Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Huntsville), said the measure ""restores balance."" Democrats and NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said the bill ""guts"" critical science missions to understand the climate and threatens NASA's broad support on Capitol Hill.
\The vote today is just one step in a congressional process of approval for NASA spending. It authorizes spending levels for FY 2016 and FY 2017 but does not appropriate any money to fund those authorizations.
\The committee bill authorizes NASA to spend $1.45 billion for Earth science in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 and for fiscal year 2017. The White House wanted $1.95 billion for next year. The committee authorizes $1.5 billion for planetary science in 2016 and 2017, up from the $1.36 billion the White House wanted next year.
\The House committee's budget keeps in step with the White House on spending for commercial crew carriers to the International Space Station in 2016, authorizing $1.24 billion ($1.84 billion in 2017), but gives more to the Space Launch System program. It authorizes $1.7 billion for the rocket and $400 million for ground support in 2016 and $1.9 billion for SLS and $432 million for ground support in 2017. The White House proposed $1.35 billion for the rocket and $410 million for ground support next year.
\The Orion capsule would be authorized $1.2 billion from the House panel in 2016 and $1.35 billion in 2016. That's against $1.1 billion requested from the White House for 2016.  
\""This NASA authorization bill seeks to maintain America's leadership in space by robustly funding a well-balanced mix of programs in areas such as space exploration, science, and aeronautics,"" Brooks said in a statement. ""It fully funds the Space Launch System, which will be America's means for future exploration beyond Low Earth Orbit. This budget-neutral bill is an investment in our future, providing NASA with the funding authorization and policy direction it needs to maintain our preeminence in space and aeronautics.""
\NASA Administrator Charles Bolden focused on Earth science in a statement after the vote. ""The NASA authorization bill making its way through the House of Representatives guts our Earth science program and threatens to set back generations worth of progress in better understanding our changing climate, and our ability to prepare for and respond to earthquakes, droughts, and storm events,"" Bolden said. ""NASA leads the world in the exploration of and study of planets, and none is more important than the one on which we live.""
\Ranking committee Democrat Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) said this: ""There are those in this country, and in this Congress, who don't think NASA should be a priority. NASA has survived and thrived over the years only because of the strong bipartisan backing of those who understand the importance of NASA to our national well-being. The bill before us will never become law. But the majority's willingness to walk away from bipartisanship in order to appease their own most ideologically driven members, risks eroding support for NASA in general.""

35,AL,"A Factory-Made Solution to Global Climate Change By Dick Resch
",Dick Resch ,"Mar 20, 2014","The United Nations recently released a 2,000-plus-page report on climate change with a straightforward conclusion -- global temperatures are rising, and human activity is the primary cause. 
\The report's 259 authors warn that catastrophic heat waves, droughts, and floods will grow more common unless governments take steps to limit greenhouse gas emissions. But there are serious political limits to what governments can do -- especially with the global economy flagging.
\Fortunately, some private firms are picking up the slack -- even notorious emitters like manufacturers. But if we're to solve the climate change problem, more businesses worldwide will need to join them -- and voluntarily reduce their own carbon emissions. 
\Make no mistake -- the time for action is now. In May, scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the concentration of carbon in the earth's atmosphere had reached record-high levels. The American Meteorological Association recently noted that 2012 was one of the 10 warmest years on record.
\But those findings are unlikely to move many governments to action. According to Alden Meyer, an environmental policy expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, the IPCC's latest assessment ""would not be a huge shot of adrenalin"" for governments to reduce carbon emissions. 
\Many private firms aren't waiting for the government to take the lead on emissions reduction. And the companies that are doing the most to reduce emissions are those who contributed the most in the first place manufacturers.
\It's now widely understood that the Industrial Revolution was a turning point in our planet's history, causing carbon emissions to rise by one-third. More recently, the rapid development of manufacturing industries in emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil has proven to be a key driver of emissions. 
\But, as the Center for American Progress points out in a new report, the manufacturing sector today ""is actually vital to the process of building a low-carbon economy.""
\Consider Unilever, one of the world's largest consumer-goods companies. Between 2008 and 2012, the firm reduced its carbon emissions from manufacturing by 838,000 tons. It plans to open seven new eco-efficient factories this year. 
\Hewlett Packard has reduced the carbon footprint of the plastic in its printer cartridges by 33 percent by switching to what it calls a ""closed loop"" recycling process.
\At my company, KI Furniture, we've dramatically cut the amount of waste that we produce. Between 2011 and 2012, we diverted more than 500,000 pounds of waste from landfills and reduced our materials usage by more than 6 percent.
\Innovative materials are also helping manufacturers shrink their carbon footprints in ways that weren't possible just a few years ago.
\For instance, Irvine, California-based start-up Newlight Technologies has developed AirCarbon -- a material derived from recycled greenhouse gases. The manufacturing process takes methane and carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and transforms them into durable plastic. The entire process is carbon negative -- it actually reduces the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.
\The trend toward environmental consciousness is catching on. A recent report from HSBC found that 84 percent of the world's largest companies have emissions targets. This might help explain why the total carbon emissions of 42 industrialized nations actually fell in 2011.
\The only way that such efforts will have a significant effect on climate change is if more businesses join in the cause. Public policy alone won't be enough. It's the responsibility of carbon-emitting enterprises to do their part in preserving our planet.

36,AL,"Alabama heats up as climate change gathers steam, scientists say
",Ben Raines,"Jan 18, 2013"," A new federal report suggests that Alabama is going to get a lot hotter. 
\In fact, by 2040, the state could be experiencing an additional 40 days a year with temperatures above 95 degrees, according to the National Climate Assessment released on January 11.
\Alabamians could be forgiven for harboring some doubts when it comes to the question of climate change. 
\It turns out the state is one of the only parts of the country that has not experienced an overall warming trend in the last 20 years. Temperatures over most of the state have apparently remained about the same as they were between 1901 and 1960, according to data gathered by federal climate researchers. 
\The rest of the country has not been so lucky. It has gotten warmer almost everywhere else, according to the climate assessment, produced by the U.S. Global Change Research Program. 
\A panel of scientists from all over the nation drafted the report, which noted rising temperatures, more severe storms, and longer droughts, among other changes. Alabama was among seven states, all in the Southeast, that have each experienced more than 33 billion-dollar weather related disasters since 1980
\""Americans are noticing changes all around them. Summers are longer and hotter, and periods of extreme heat last longer than any living American has ever experienced,"" read a letter accompanying the report. ""Winters are generally shorter and warmer. Rain comes in heavier downpours, though in many regions there are longer dry spells in between."" 
\The researchers state that ""the evidence for a changing climate has strengthened considerably since the last National Climate Assessment report, written in 2009.""
\Overall, the report concludes the Southeast experiences about five fewer frost free nights per year today, as compared to the average between 1901 and 1960. 
\The portion of the state north of Montgomery is expected to experience 20 fewer frost free nights a year between 2040 and 2070. The northernmost part of the state, including Birmingham, Huntsville, and Tuscaloosa, will have 25 fewer cold nights. 
\But it is the change expected on the other end of the thermometer that will hurt the most. Alabama currently experiences 30 days or less per year where the mercury hits the 95 degree mark. That could jump to 70 days each year with temperatures that high, according to the report.
\The idea of twice as many days above 95 degrees is an arresting one. 
\Those hotter temperatures will lead to a range of other changes, few of them positive, according to the report. The resulting increase in water temperatures could mean more months of the year when oysters have high levels of bacteria in them. And the increased temperatures will likely be a boon for creatures like mosquitoes and pests like pine bark beetles, according to the report.

Mo Brooks, R-Huntsville, is a member, held a hearing Thursday ""to examine the methodology and reliability of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report.""
\The takeaway for what happened in the hearing depends on your point of view.
\Brooks' office issued a press release late Thursday about the hearing, which included this paragraph:
\During the hearing, Brooks questioned the expert witnesses about climate models used by the Obama Administration to justify costly policies that stifle economic growth, cost jobs, and burden American families with higher costs of living. Brooks asked whether these climate projection models should be relied on given that past, real climate data (referenced in the below chart created by Dr. John Christy at the University of Alabama in Huntsville) proves the climate models have been notably inaccurate in predicting future climate change.  The witnesses' response:  excellent question.  
\Meanwhile, one of the witnesses at the hearing -- Michael Oppenheimer, Albert G. Milbank Professor of Geosciences and International Affairs, Department of Geosciences, Princeton University - summed up his views on Twitter that linked to his blog about the hearing.
\The Washington Times covered the hearing.Committee chair Lamar Smith, R-Texas, released this statement about the hearing, which included this conclusion:
\""The Obama administration should stop trying to scare Americans and then impose costly, unnecessary regulations on them. The President says there is no debate. Actually the debate has only just begun.
\""When assessing climate change, we need to make sure that findings are driven by science, not an alarmist, partisan agenda.""
\Brooks' press release included a Q&A between Brooks and panelists Roger Pielke Sr.,Senior Research Scientist, Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, and Professor Emeritus of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University, and Daniel Botkin, Professor Emeritus, Department of  Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology, University of California, Santa Barbara.
\Here is that Q&A:
\Congressman Brooks:  Why does it matter that these climate models have failed so frequently?
\Dr. Pielke:  Well it's one of the tests of the model.  I mean, if you're going to use these models to try to predict what will happen in the next several decades, you want to have some confidence that they're robust tools, and I think the models have failed to show that.  In fact, I think they've been a cause for a lot of the debate and discussion.  And I think, what Michael was saying, we don't probably need the models, because the models are misleading us.  They're talking about a future that may not occur.  It certainly hasn't shown that the models are able to replicate what's happened in the last several decades.  And so you wouldn't believe a weather prediction model that was forecast for tomorrow or the next day if it kept failing all the time.  I think that's what we have with these climate models.  They're not ready for prime time.  Models are very useful.  They understand processes, they can help assimilate data, but as forecasting tools decades into the future, they're not ready.
\Brooks:  Dr. Botkin, do you have anything to add?
\Dr. Botkin:  Yes, first of all, the models are well known not to be very well validated at any level.  And there's work, such as by [J.] Scott Armstrong, who's an expert on model validation mainly for businesses, and he says that these climate models meet hardly any of the criteria for legitimate validation.  And so, you have to question the validity of the model.  And I say this having worked on some of the models.  I had a graduate student who added vegetation to one of the climate models as his Ph.D. thesis.  So I think that the models, since they are so much failing to come close and haven't been well-validated, they're not a good guide now.
\Brooks:  Well we've used this ""97% of scientists agree"" kind of number--is it fair to say that close to 100% of scientists agree that our models are failures?
\Pielke:  No, a lot of people--look, obviously they don't believe they're failures because they base the IPCC and national climate assessment on it.
\Brooks:  Well let me be more specific, that for the time frame from 2000 to 2014 that they have failed?
\Pielke:  I would think some would still disagree.  They've been trying to explain why they're not agreeing, why there's less warming.  They say now the warming has gone deeper into the ocean, for example, which obviously raises the question, if it's gone deeper in the ocean, why didn't they predict that?  But I would think there are people who are still arguing that the models are robust.
\Brooks:  Well I'm looking at the graph, is this graph accurate?
\Pielke:  Yes, the graph is accurate.
\Brooks:  Well the graph shows that the models don't correspond with actual temperatures.  So how can people contend that the models are good if they're way off base with the temperatures, with the exception of perhaps one or two out of all the models being run?
\Pielke:  That is an excellent question.  But I think it's even broader than that because as I showed in my written testimony, there are a range of peer-reviewed papers that have shown when these models have run over the last several decades, they can't predict regional statistics well at all, they can't predict changes in regional climate statistics, and therefore there's a whole range of reasons they shouldn't be accepted.  But the problem is this issue is not being discussed, and it wasn't discussed at the NIPCC.

\Christy, director of the Earth System Science Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and Spencer, a research scientist at UAH, recently celebrated the 25th anniversary of their climate research using data from satellites rather than ground-based data.
\The two collaborated on the research announced in 1990 that indicated global temperatures were rising at a slower rate than believed by other scientists.
\That research, as well as subsequent research, has led Christy and Spencer to downplay the potential dangerous effects of global warming. That perspective has led Christy and Spencer to describe themselves as climate change ""skeptics.""
\7 questions with John Christy and Roy Spencer: Climate change skeptics for 25 years.
\The Guardian article was written by Dana Nuccitelli, who co-authored a paper two years ago that concluded that 97.1 percent of scientists who endorsed the idea of global warming ""endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming."" The paper also found that 66.4 percent of 11,994 abstracts reviewed from 1991-2011 expressed no position on global warming.
\Nuccitelli also published a book last month titled: ""Climatology versus Pseudoscience: Exposing the Failed Predictions of Global Warming Skeptics."" 
\The book ""debunks myths such as the idea that climate scientists and climate models have grossly over-predicted global warming,"" according to its ad on Amazon.com.
\The Guardian article also said that ""much of Spencer and Christy's contrarian research has not withstood subsequent scientific scrutiny.""
\The Guardian article concludes: ""Spencer and Christy made a valuable scientific contribution by creating their atmospheric temperature data set. However, given how few climate scientists dispute the expert consensus on human-caused global warming, it's useful to examine their research and comments with a critical eye. When we do, it becomes clear that they have less in common with Galileo than with the scientists who disputed the links between smoking and cancer.""

\The conference was very informative on issues that are facing the Arctic with the push for extracting more polluting fossil fuel to feed their economies and our need to stop runaway climate change. Next April, Fairbanks will host the Alaska Rural Energy Conference, and we’d like to see more Yukoners join us to learn about the energy challenges and solutions in Alaska. 
\As we drove home from Alaska, we ruminated about how wonderful it would be to drive an electric car back to Fairbanks. Over the day’s drive, we strategized about how to electrify the Alaska Highway and fuel its communities along the way with renewable energy. 
\For us to use that electric car, we would need an EV charging station in every highway lodge and community from the Yukon to Alaska. We want all of those communities to be able to produce renewable energy, store it, use it and sell it to us to recharge our car.
\These communities would build resilience through energy efficient homes and businesses. Energy storage systems would protect the community from rising fossil fuel costs.
\As these communities thrive and grow, the local grid could then be expanded to other renewable energy projects along the highway. Eventually, most of these small communities will be able to connect to each other and start selling renewable electricity to each other’s markets. This new energy infrastructure can spread all over the world and we could become leaders in building this new economy. 
\The inspiration we received from the Arctic Energy Summit is just one hopeful consequence of the un-muzzling of scientists. With our federal election near, we want our fellow Canadians to understand there are good solutions and a vibrant economy awaiting us as we shrug off our addiction to fossil fuels. 
\Our brightest minds are working to solve these problems. Voters need to step up and help us achieve a better future for our children and vote for the person who shows diplomacy and will work across party lines to save our precious home, Earth.

\FAIRBANKS — We desperately need a paradigm shift regarding our attitude toward energy in this state. While the rest of the world is rapidly shifting to clean abundant renewables we are, once again (see the Healy Unit 2 power plant), burdening at least the next two generation of Alaskans with debt and dependence-anchors to the past. As ground zero for the global effects of a rapidly changing climate, we have an opportunity to plant the seeds of change by embracing the merits of a clean energy economy. Recognizing the multitude of benefits that come along with decentralized microgrids, stabilized by a combination of clean technologies such as wind, solar and biofuels translates into lower energy cost, job creation and improved air quality. Using the same pipes laid for natural gas, we can eliminate organic waste in every community in Alaska by digesting it to produce power (including transportation) and as a by-product, get soil for the garden. Then, there is geothermal and microhydro to consider as sources. The list goes on regarding the abundance of technologies that provide alternatives to the short-sighted investment into the dinosaur economy, and I have confidence that in making a transition no one will freeze. 
\In one hour, the sun generates enough power to run our entire civilization for a year. Alaska has the resources to draw power 10 months out of the year and the technology to comfortably meet at least half of our electrical and heating needs annually. If we just took a bite of this low-hanging fruit it would change the entire dynamic in Alaska and finally provide the jobs, clean air and affordable energy we keep getting promised. What Germany, a world leader in solar energy, and many other countries have that we currently lack is the political will to put real limits on the companies using lobbyist to write law, buy representatives and make their profiteering legal at the cost of the community and the planet. An oil ex-executive as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency is a perfect example of how fools multiply when wise men stay silent.
\Fortunately, the economic climate is also shifting. GE just announced they are cutting 12,000 jobs from their energy sector because the demand for coal and natural gas just isn’t there. At the same time, according to a CNN article, the clean energy economy is growing 17 times faster than the rest of the economy combined with a sustained growth rate of 24 percent. It’s expected this industry will add more than 24 million jobs by 2030. In defiance of Trump, both Anchorage and Fairbanks mayors have pledged to support the Paris climate accords. The cost of solar technology has dropped more than 50 percent in just the past five years. In addition, financial institutes, like Denali Federal Credit Union, are now offering financing for residential solar panels. Harnessed for the millennium, sunlight is free.
\For the past six years I have organized the annual solar tour, which had a record 12 sites this season. With 165 systems tied into the Golden Valley Electric Association grid, it is clear solar works in Alaska. When companies like Giant Tire and HooDoo Brewery convert, you know the industry is primed to go mainstream. Earlier this year, I managed to convince some local groups to go after the Department of Energy SunShot challenge, which is a national competition with prizes totalling $5 million for communities who can develop models for financing community solar projects; projects that specifically meet the needs of under served populations. As a result, we got $10,000 in technical vouchers, the borough is now seriously looking (after five years of advocacy) at solar for schools. I have been working on a presentation to instigate solar projects with local churches as a forerunner to strive for energy independence for every corner of the state.
\Historically, Alaska is known as an oil state. Just like the U.S., historically, was known for the slave trade. When we came together and mustered the political courage to abolish slavery we thrived. While no system is perfect, most would agree we are in a much better place. The same is true of making the just transition from drilling for dinosaurs to harnessing the free, clean and abundant energy from the natural world all around us. When we let go of the past, the future becomes clear. With an aerospace university, extreme environmental conditions and hundreds of isolated communities we could thrive as a STEM (science, technology, engineering and math education) state, helping Elon Musk win the race to Mars.

",Top of Form,"Mar 26, 2016","Bottom of Form
\Fairbanks Daily 
\Alaska’s fiscal and economic crisis, as well the impacts of our warming climate are two topics grabbing headlines in Alaska on a daily basis. On Monday at 1 p.m. in the Fairbanks Pipeline Training Center, Sen. Lisa Murkowski will be holding a field hearing for the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The topic of the hearing is “Expanding Alaska Resource Development — Opportunities to Create Jobs and Strengthen National Security.”
\Conspicuously missing from the list of invited witnesses is anyone who will advocate for the development of Alaska’s vast renewable resources. As chairman of the Committee, Sen. Murkowski has instead selected witnesses with ties that represent to the extractive industries. These witnesses will undoubtedly call for doubling down on the fossil fuel dependency that has caused the economic and environmental downturns that Alaskans are yearning to escape from. 
\The development and deployment of renewable energy sources, on the other hand, is precisely what will be necessary in the years ahead to diversify Alaska’s economy, offer Alaskans true independence from the volatile price swings of fossil fuels and prevent dangerous climate change that is already damaging our state’s vulnerable landscapes, oceans, ecosystems, infrastructure and communities. Many economists, scientists, community leaders, faith-based organizations and residents throughout Alaska have been advocating for such a transition. 
\These are the stakeholders from Fairbanks and across Alaska that the Senate committee needs to hear from. Last month, Sen. Murkowski hosted another field hearing in Bethel that highlighted the development of renewable innovations in rural villages, and she should be commended for her leadership on that issue. But renewables are not just a niche innovation being used to power micro-girds in Alaska’s rural villages. 
\Renewables must be the foundation of a new energy system that powers all of Alaska, the United States and the rest of the world without emitting carbon pollution. Alaska needs Murkowski to lead on legislation that diversifies our economy, stimulates a just transition to renewables and protects our climate. The upcoming hearing appears set on accomplishing just the opposite.

\FAIRBANKS — A decade after the first Renewable Energy Fair was held at Chena Hot Springs Resort, the annual event has become a magnet for politicians, scientists and innovators.
\The fair trumpets advances in renewable energy, with a backdrop of the geothermal-powered resort at the end of Chena Hot Springs Road. Presentations on LED lighting, hydrogen energy and more were held during a series of sessions during a drizzly Sunday.
\This year hundreds of spectators browsed through the area, listening to speakers that included Gov. Bill Walker, Sen. Dan Sullivan and Fairbanks North Star Borough Mayor Luke Hopkins. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who planned to attend, canceled due to a family matter.
\Chena Hot Springs Resort owner Bernie Karl, who serves as a high-volume emcee for the event, said he launched it with a simple goal.
\“All I envisioned was sharing knowledge,” he said. “If you keep knowledge, what good is it?”
\Karl said he’s on a continuing search for energy solutions in the North, particularly Alaska. One booth included a massive tub of compressed recycled paper, which Karl’s other business, K&K Recycling, burns to generate electricity. Other displays included compressed wooden logs, advances in cold-weather building designs and geothermal technology.
\“This is a place where it’s very clear that ideas matter, people matter, innovations matter,” Sullivan said.
\Karl used this year’s fair to introduce keynote speaker Stefan Larsson-Mastonstrale, the chairman of the Swedish company Insresol. The company is developing a “personal power plant” roughly the size of an end table that it views as the eventual replacement for large-scale energy projects.
\Its inventors claim the device uses a new type of external-combustion engine to convert solar, biomass or other energy types into a self-contained heat and power plant. Not only will it allow people to save on their utility bills, they say, but will allow them to sell excess electricity to their local utilities.
\Larsson-Mastonstrale said the flow of that electricity through the Internet will allow people to create a virtual grid, eliminating the need for massive energy plants. A network of 250,000 users reportedly makes enough energy to replace a nuclear power plant.
\Karl said he’s toured the Swedish factory where the generators are made and convinced Larsson-Mastonstrale to unveil it to the public at the fair.
\“It’s going to change energy,” he said. “It’s going to change the way we live in the Arctic in the future.”
\Such optimism has become part of Karl’s trademark for the event. 
\Amid a state budget crunch and high energy prices in much of Alaska, Walker said he appreciates the positive tone. He said his week included touring five remote villages — including one where the power plant was connected to hand-pumped 55-gallon oil drums — and that the contrast between problems and potential solutions is encouraging.
\He said other energy projects in the state, such as a biomass-powered boiler at the Tok school, can be traced to innovations like the ones displayed at Chena Hot Springs.
\“I always leave feeling much better than when I arrived,” Walker said.
\Hopkins said he believes that such showcases will eventually translate into practical solutions for the state’s residents.
\“We’re here to move energy from a darn good idea to a darn good solution,” Hopkins said.

5,AK,"GVEA plans to add more renewable energy
",Kevin Baird,"May 14, 2017","Top of Form
\Bottom of Form
\FAIRBANKS — Golden Valley Electric Association’s generation portfolio could add more renewable energy in the next decade. 
\And the co-op has a big decision to make regarding the coal power plant known as Healy 1. 
\GVEA President and CEO Cory Borgeson briefly touched on his vision of more renewable energy in the future during the co-ops annual member meeting — mentioning an additional four turbines at GVEA’s own Eva Creek wind farm, Mike Craft’s proposed 13.5-megawatt wind farm, and the Fire Island 2 wind project. Borgeson said GVEA could be putting more batteries into the system to accommodate the increase in renewable energy. 
\Borgeson also announced GVEA would construct a half megawatt solar array near Fairbanks. Borgeson said the small array would be somewhat experimental in nature to see solar arrays cost effective. Borgeson said there are currently 165 solar producers on the grid and an independent power producer has been in contact with GVEA about a creating 1-megawatt solar array near Salcha. 
\Connecting with GVEA is relatively easy and encouraging if the renewable energy source is less than 2 megawatts, Borgeson said. He said an independent power producer that generates more than 2 megawatts will incur regulation costs. 
\ 
\Healy 1 
\The 28-megawatt coal plant known as Healy 1 is due for an environmental permitting upgrade in 2022, Borgeson said. If the permit and upgrade are not met, the plant would be shut down in 2024 and GVEA would lose a cheap source of energy. 
\“It’s a decision we have to make. We haven’t mapped it out. I would suggest it’s more than $50 million to upgrade,” Borgeson said. 
\Borgeson said the Healy 1 plant’s output wouldn’t doom the grid but it would be a tough loss because coal power plants from the 1960s  are lasting a long time and the plant is well maintained. 
\ 
\Healy 2
\Healy 2 — the plant formerly known as the Healy Clean Coal Project — was purchased by GVEA in 2013 from the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority for $44 million. After repairs and upgrades the power plant went online in 2015 before an explosion took it out of commission. Healy 2 has since had another small explosion. 
\Borgeson said the plant is still six months to a year from coming online, but when its operational it will produce the cheapest power in the rail belt. 
\“The cost of power out of that plant is so low it is competitive with anything being produced by the Anchorage utilities,” Borgeson said. Borgeson plans to sell power from Healy 2 to other railbelt utilities in an effort to lower member energy rates. “We are always a buyer. When Healy unit 2 runs it would be dispatched all the time. It could be sold to the south.”
\In addition, Borgeson said relationships with other railbelt utilities are at a high point, and these companies have not been so friendly in the past. 
\The Golden Valley Electric Association was formed in 1946. The co-op now has more than 34,000 members and serves the Interior communities stretching from Fairbanks to Delta Junction and south to Cantwell.

\FAIRBANKS — For many, the options for renewable energy may seem pretty limited.
\There’s solar, hydro and wind, and they each come with additional challenges in the Arctic, where winter nights are short and water tends to freeze.
\But there’s plenty on the horizon that could be promising. Some of those technologies are on display this week at the Arctic Energy Summit in Fairbanks, a three-day event at the Carlson Center. 
\The event is hosted by the Alaska-based Institute of the North and has brought in government, industry and other experts from Arctic nations around the world to discuss energy.
\One of those people was Dr. Eric Bibeau, from the University of Manitoba. He acknowledged the challenges facing energy and heat generation in the Arctic, but said his job is to come up with “the new technology to solve it.”
\“The take home message I want you to leave with is that don’t think what you hear in terms of renewable energy is all you’ll have in the future,” he said. “There’s people who work very tirelessly at developing ideas and the world you move forward is going to be full of solutions.”
\Bibeau focused most of his presentation on thermosiphons, a special piping system that leeches the heat out of the ground to help heat and potentially even generate power in a building.
\You’ll see them on the support pillars of the trans-Alaska pipeline system or along the road. They passively suck heat out of the ground, keeping the permafrost cool and the pipeline or road stable.
\Bibeau said they could be used to help cool or heat homes in the Arctic as well as keeping the ground stable. He said the idea could be adapted with the addition of a coolant like ethylene glycol to increase the heat transfer capacity. Such a system could also be used to run a refrigerator without the need to plug it in, he said. 
\“It’s a pipe,” he said. “All you need is a pipe, there’s nothing fancy to it.”
\He also discussed innovations in biomass as well as better ways to utilize solar panels by designing a system that recognizes they’ll rarely be generating their maximum peak load.
\“The future looks renewable and don’t think that one size fits all,” he said. “The oil and gas industry has trained us to be single-minded in one approach, but if you want to go renewable you better like diversity.”

\SEWARD, Alaska - The Kenai Peninsula city of Seward has voted to move away from heating oil and create a renewable energy heating district.
\The Seward City Council voted Monday to move forward with a project to heat four city buildings using heat from Resurrection Bay tides, according to the Alaska Dispatch News (http://bit.ly/1JB1mrq).
\The proposed system would use a series of heat loops that would absorb energy from sea water moving through gravel 200 to 300 feet below the city's waterfront.
\Andy Baker, an Anchorage-based renewable energy consultant with his own company, YourCleanEnergy, said if built, the system would be the farthest-north ground source heat pump in the country.
\The project has been around for years, especially after the Alaska SeaLife Center, an aquarium and marine mammal rehabilitation facility, successfully implemented a similar system to heat the entire building in 2012.
\""This process in Seward has been very steady, slow-moving, but steady, and always going forward,"" Baker said Tuesday. ""And that's a good model for a lot of these towns.""
\The council has agreed to apply for an $850,000 Alaska Energy Authority Renewables Energy Fund grant and allocated $85,000 in city general funds to make the grant competitive.
\Assistant city manager Ron Long estimates heating the library, city hall, a city annex and fire department with renewable energy will save the city up to $76,000 annually.
\With President Barack Obama's visit to the city just hours after the council passed the decision, Long said he wished he could highlight Seward's progress toward renewable energy and fighting climate change even further.
\""I really wish I had an opportunity to say, 'Look what our city council did last night!'"" he said. ""But I can see how it's not possible that I would be able to have lunch with the president.""

\FAIRBANKS — The annual Renewable Energy Fair at Chena Hot Springs Resort is a place for big ideas.
\Sunday’s event featured a plethora of promising projects and presentations in the fields of geothermal, wind to heat ideas, solar power, hydro power and even horse power.
\But the project that was turning the most heads was the insulated shipping trailer filled with hundreds of heads of lettuce growing happily under rows of LED lights.
\The system is based on years of trial-and-error in Chena Hot Springs’ year-round greenhouse, which produces lettuce and tomatoes as well as other produce.
\“If we had not been successful over there, we wouldn’t even try this,” said Jeff Warner, the controlled-climate specialist at Chena Hot Springs Resort.
\Warner and Chena Hot Springs have been working for years with researchers at the University of Alaska Fairbanks on perfecting the balance of lights, water, heat, humidity and air-circulation to grow plants year round.
\The idea with the shipping container, which is destined for Glennallen, is that a community could employ one or more to grow produce that would otherwise be costly or impossible to ship in.
\Warner said the trailers, which can be built locally and shipped throughout the state, can produce as much as 150 heads of lettuce per week.
\The possibilities the unit posed turned a lot of heads, including that of U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who is a regular face at the annual event.
\“It’s really very impressive what they’re doing with it,” she said. “You could feed a whole community.”
\Warner said the economics of the project are still being calculated, and it’s unclear whether a trailer grow will be a cost effective source for produce in the Fairbanks supermarkets, but said it could be readily deployed to places like the flood-hit Galena.
\“You’ve got to think of every square inch because it’s valuable,” he said. “If I can go buy it cheaper at the store, then I will buy it at the store.”
\When asked if he could grow the hearty green kale, Warner said it’s possible but that it likely wouldn’t make economic sense because not many people like kale.
\But at the end of the day, no matter what sort of indoor growing operation is built, whether it’s in a trailer or a warehouse, it will require knowledgeable hard-working people to operate it.
\Anything from incorrect water pH, to a door left open too long or even cigarettes tainted with tobacco mosaic virus could wipe out an entire crop in moments.
\“Our objective is to provide a nice, stable system that can be operated by knowledgeable people,” he said. “I can build the Taj Mahal of hydroponic systems, but they can put the wrong kind of gas in the tank and everything will die.”
\Luckily, though, a lot of those mistakes have been made at the Chena Hot Springs Resort’s greenhouses, which he says are the testing bed to prove that indoor growing can work in Alaska.
\“The idea is to make the mistakes so you don’t have to,” he said. “We just keep replanting.”

\KOTZEBUE, Alaska - The White House announced Wednesday that it would launch a $4 million initiative to speed the development of renewable energy in remote Alaskan communities, part of a package of new programs aimed at reducing fossil fuel use and countering climate impacts in the region of the world that is warming the fastest.
\The issue of high-cost energy is an acute one in this area of Alaska, where shipping in diesel and gas by barge means residents pay far more to power their homes and run their vehicles than Americans in the lower 48.
\Vernon Adams Sr., vice chair of the tribal government council in the small village of Noatak, said the enormous transportation costs made it imperative they figure out new ways to cut fuel costs.
\""We'd like all the help we can get to get our fuel in a safe manner and enjoy a little of our spending money, rather than spending it on the high cost of fuel,"" Adams said.
\Alaskans paid an average price of 18.12 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity in 2013, according to federal data - second only to New York and Hawaii - but in this part of Alaska, residents pay at least 40 cents a kilowatt hour, even after receiving a state subsidy aimed at making energy costs more equitable across Alaska.
\The renewable energy funding was one of several initiatives the administration unveiled Wednesday under the umbrella of helping tribal and rural communities cope with climate change and other challenges. White House officials said the Denali Commission, an independent federal agency since 1998, would serve as the federal coordinator for building climate resilience in rural Alaska, and would provide $2 million to support voluntary relocation efforts for vulnerable villages.
\The Agricultural Department said Wednesday that it will provide $17.6 million to bolster health operations in more than a dozen communities, as well as $240,000 to improve water and sewage treatment operations in rural Alaska.
\White House senior adviser Brian Deese told reporters the administration was committed to protecting tribal members' way of life.
\""Alaskan Natives have been living in this land and with this way of life for thousands of years. These traditions and ways of live are ... important to our country, important to the state and they are Americans,"" Deese said, adding that officials are working to determine ""because of changes in climate, what can we do to make sure that these traditions and way of life are not lost forever.""
\Still, several tribal leaders who gathered in Kotzebue, which will be the last stop on President Barack Obama's three-day tour of Alaska, said they expected more from the federal government given the peril their communities now face.
\Kivalina tribal government council President Millie Hawley, whose 400-person town stretches eight miles along a gravel spit, has sought federal funding for both an evacuation road and a complete relocation of the village. She noted that in 2004, the town lost at least 70 feet from the side that borders the Chukchi Sea, and changing weather has made the resources villagers depend on less predictable.
\Moving to a major city or different area in Alaska, Hawley said, would devastate the community. ""You're asking us to not be a people anymore,"" she said. ""The land and the resources of our land make us a people.""
\A total relocation of Buckland would cost roughly $100 million; even building the evacuation road would cost roughly $15 million.
\Percy Ballot, tribal government council president of Buckland, said of the $2 million funding announcement: ""We appreciate that, we really do, but we're going to need more money than that. ... If you could, please, pass the message on.""
\Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, noted in an interview that the president has pledged to provide $3 billion to help people in developing countries overseas cope with climate impacts, but rural Alaskans face many of the same challenges..
\In some places, ""there is no running water, there are no sanitation facilities. That puts you in Third World status,"" Murkowski said. ""He's willing to pledge the money for developing countries. But there's a saying that charity begins at home. We don't want to forget.""
\Still, Kotzebue is also a model for how rural communities can chart a new energy trajectory. In this small town 32 miles north of the Arctic Circle, officials have begun a major effort to cut their use of high-cost diesel by launching wind and solar projects.
\The Kotzebue Electric Association has established 19 wind turbine towers, each 250 feet tall, roughly four miles from town. They now provide 20 percent of Kotzebue's electricity and save it 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel a year. The association also manages wind projects for neighboring communities: Buckland dedicated two 100-kilowatt turbines in August, and Deering will be commissioning a 100-kilowatt turbine in October.
\""We are very pleased to see the president's focus on rural energy solutions,"" said Brad Reeve, the association's general manager. ""Accelerating Rural Alaska's integration of renewable energy sources like wind and solar will increase the sustainability of all Arctic communities.""
\The Northwest Arctic Borough, which helps govern not just Kotzebue but also 10 smaller surrounding communities, has also provided a grant to expand solar power in the region and to help run their water and sewer services. The grant has established a 20-KW project in Kotzebue and 10-KW solar projects in nine of the surrounding villages.
\Microgrids proliferate in Alaska because its rural communities are so far-flung. Alaska boasts more than 200 of them, according to Navigant Research, more than any other state. But diesel energy remains dominant: Only 70 of the microgrids have renewable power as part of their supply.
\""Isolated Alaskan villages provide a perfect template for developing practical, ""smart"" renewable energy systems than can largely replace dirty, expensive diesel power,"" said David Hayes, who helped lead the Interior Department's Arctic strategy as deputy secretary during Obama's first term and is now a visiting law professor at Stanford University. ""Marshaling U.S. technology to develop lower-cost, replicable, small-scale systems could dramatically improve the quality of life for villagers in Alaska and around the world.""
\Before heading to Kotzebue, Obama traveled to Dillingham in southwest Alaska, where he met with fishing operators and spoke of the need to protect the world's largest sockeye salmon fishery. Noting that he had barred oil and gas production in the region's Bristol Bay, he said it ""represents not just a critical way of life that has to be preserved, but it also represents one of the most important natural resources that the United States has.""
\""And by the way, that fish jerky, outstanding,"" he said, prompting laughter. ""So I strongly recommend it.""

",Becky Bohrer / Associated Press,"Feb 17, 2014","Top of Form
\Bottom of Form
\JUNEAU, Alaska - In 2010, the state adopted an energy policy that, among other things, set a goal of having 50 percent Alaska's electric generation come from renewable and alternative energy sources by 2025.
\The likeliest way to reach the goal is widely believed to include a major project in south-central Alaska, the proposed Susitna-Watana hydro complex. But the project, which critics see as unnecessary with the state pursuing a natural gas pipeline, is far from assured.
\Rep. Bill Stoltze, R-Chugiak, vented his frustration during a House Finance Committee hearing last week, saying the state should stop talking about the goal because he didn't see a commitment to it from Gov. Sean Parnell's administration. Stoltze later said his comments were more of a political challenge, borne of a desire to have a more open discussion on projects - to know, for example, what impact one project, like a gas line, could have on another, like Susitna.
\""If we can't juggle two things at once, let the public know,"" he said.
\Parnell spokeswoman Sharon Leighow said the state remains committed to the renewable-energy goal as demonstrated by investments in and ongoing work on the Susitna project and other hydro and wind projects across Alaska. Parnell included $10 million in next year's budget for the project.
\The governor said earlier this month that he had no basis to ask legislators for more money until the Alaska Energy Authority (AEA), which is behind the Susitna project, had made substantial progress toward or completed land-access agreements.
\AEA spokeswoman Emily Ford said the authority is currently negotiating land-access permits and hoped to soon have a signed permit to conduct environmental field work.
\The authority had sought $110 million to complete its initial study report and prepare its license application for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during the upcoming fiscal year. It requested and received more time to file its report, which was initially due Feb. 3.
\In recent years, the state has provided more than $170 million toward the project. With projections calling for slumping revenues and the state facing the prospect of using savings to get by, some lawmakers - like Stoltze's House Finance co-chair, Alan Austerman - have called for taking a tough look at projects and deciding if they are the best places for continued investment.
\House Speaker Mike Chenault told a news conference last month he believes that both Susitna and the gas line are needed to meet Alaska's future energy requirements. He called the money being spent now lead-up money, going toward work that will help the state decide whether the projects are viable and worth pursuing.
\Rep. Craig Johnson, R-Anchorage, noted that the lead-up phase isn't cheap. ""But I don't think that we want to advance the project without going through the due process, and that's not an inexpensive process,"" he said.
\Critics of the project worry about the impact the dam could have on things like salmon and river levels and flow. They fear it could be vulnerable in an earthquake.
\The project as proposed would be one of the tallest dams built in the U.S. in decades. Current plans call for a 735-foot dam built into the Susitna River Canyon and a reservoir that would stretch more than 40 miles. It is currently projected to cost $5.2 billion, though it is not yet clear how it might be financed.
\Melis Coady, who was recently in Juneau with a group of Susitna opponents, said Susitna isn't a good fit for the energy needs of Alaska, which in parts of the Railbelt include a need for more affordable heating options. Electricity, she said, doesn't keep you warm. She worries the state backed itself into a corner with Susitna and the renewable-energy goal.
\Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, said he thinks Alaskans would love to get to the 50 percent goal, but he believes it would be extremely difficult without a project like Susitna. He said projects need to stand on their own and he still has questions about Susitna's impact on fisheries.
\""If the project doesn't work out for whatever reason, we need to re-evaluate,"" he said.
\Rep. Charisse Millett, who helped craft the energy policy, said she believes the renewable goal is attainable with or without Susitna. Other projects on the books through the Renewable Energy Fund can help move the state closer to that goal, she said.
\""Technology is moving faster and faster every day,"" Millett said.
\According to the 2013 Renewable Energy Atlas of Alaska, hydroelectric power supplies 20 percent of Alaska's electricity in an average water year. Wind provides less than 1 percent.
\The governor's Office of Management and Budget has reported the state's renewable-energy portfolio has grown steadily since 2008.
\Millett, R-Anchorage, supports the state continuing to pursue both Susitna and a gas-line project, in case one falters. Natural gas, while not renewable, is still a good form of ""clean"" energy, she said.
\The tone of discussion has changed since her first session in 2009, she said, moving from the state doing ""absolutely nothing"" for energy to what the state is doing and the available options.
\The issue now is money, she said.
\""But we're still all working toward the same goal: sustainable, cost-efficient energy for the whole state,"" Millett said.

\JUNEAU, Alaska - Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson near Anchorage now receives 25 percent of its electricity from old trash.
\Air Force Lt. Gen. Stephen Hoog, the senior military officer in Alaska, updated lawmakers on the status of the landfill gas power plant during a presentation to the Joint Armed Services Committee meeting Thursday.
\Hoog expects the plant, which has been operational since September, to pay for itself in five years.
\The project was made possible by a partnership with the Municipality of Anchorage and Doyon Utilities.
\Hoog says the plant uses processed methane collected from the Anchorage landfill. That gas would have otherwise been vented and burned into the atmosphere.
\Federal regulations require bases to power at least seven percent of their operations using renewable energy.

\The No. 1 issue you don’t hear about in the upcoming election is global climate change. Big oil and coal corporations have been highly effective in the denial effort, especially in Washington with huge donations to campaigns. The Koch brothers, BP, Exxon Mobil and other energy interests, working with such groups as the Competitive Enterprise Institute and National Chamber of Commerce, have convinced nearly half of America that climate change is not a problem.
\This effort by big energy can be expected considering the trillions tied to drill rigs, pipelines, refineries and filling stations. The coal industry has huge investments in mountain-top removal mining and supply for power plants. The unfortunate thing is that a scientific fact became political issue when Al Gore got involved and made such statements that the sea levels would rise 30 feet. This gave the deniers a valid argument.
\The sea level has risen about six inches in the past 100 years and will rise about an inch per decade. This can be dealt with as the Netherlands has done with some costs. The climate models developed by scientists previously are so accurate they predict the climate we are experiencing. Not only the rise in temperature, but drought, storms and floods such as in Pakistan and Thailand. Texas and Nebraska had a drought that lasted the entire summer.
\Burning of fossil fuels causes acidification of the oceans from the high concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that is absorbed into ocean water, forming carbonic acid. This is casing loss of coral reefs and affecting shelled sea life. Warming of ocean water also is affecting salmon migration and may affect Alaska’s fishing. 
\For those who are interested, there are two books I think are among the best: “The Weather of the Future,” by Dr. Heidi Cullin and a book pertaining specifically to Alaska, “Early Warming,” by Nancy Lord.

\I recently read a book by Carla Wise — biologist, environmental writer, and mother — called “Awake on Earth: Facing Climate Change with Sanity and Grace.” Reading it broke through my despair and paralysis concerning the frightening specter of climate change. Her main point is that, even though time is strongly against us in terms of preventing significant damage to people’s lives, turning that tide around is not completely impossible. The recent slowing of tropical deforestation, the decline of coal use, the increasing accessibility of renewable energy, the rise of climate activism, and the passage of the Paris accord all suggest that change is still an option.
\In Alaska, we are ahead of many other places: We have already developed much of the self-sufficiency and resilience that will help prepare us for the coming changes. In many ways we already have a safety net in place for a complicated future. Even if the future is difficult or tragic, it can be positive too. How we imagine it changes how we feel and act, and how positive it turns out to be.
\We resist change, especially when we think failure is likely. But building our community’s strength and choosing how we each want to participate in the change counters that pessimism. There are many small ways to reduce our carbon consumption: hanging clothes to dry sometimes, saying no now and then to trips that use motorized vehicles, buying one less product we don’t really need, and adding solar panels to our homes are just a few. Sky’s the limit where our human inventiveness is concerned. Express yourself in your own unique way to help create the world you want to live in.
\Reading Carla’s book is a great place to start. And in Fairbanks, two local groups are working on developing our ability to make changes: the Fairbanks Climate Action Coalition and the local chapter of the national group Citizens’ Climate Lobby. Whether you think climate change is human-caused or not, it is here, and it is time to take action in the ways we feel ready to do so.

",Tom Baring Fairbanks,"Mar 14, 2016","Except for mushers and ice carvers, I haven’t heard anyone complaining about the weather. It’s been a very easy winter but, not to detract from anyone’s enjoyment, I find it ominous.
\2015 was the hottest year on record, breaking the previous 14 records, all of which were set during the last 17 years. According to the Feb. 21 News-Miner article, “New data finds unusually high temperatures in Arctic,” January was the hottest month ever recorded on Earth and the anomaly was especially great in the arctic.
\Meanwhile, atmospheric CO2 is now more than 400 parts per million (compared to the pre-industrial level of 280 PPM) and it keeps on growing.
\Along with easy winters, of course, we get ice storms and power outages, coastal erosion and stranded walrus herds as sea ice becomes less predictable, sinkholes and infrastructure damage as permafrost melts. The oceans are warming and becoming more acidic from excess CO2, which is bleaching reefs and altering marine ecosystems, including those on which Alaskan salmon rely.
\Until we shift from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources, CO2 concentrations will continue rising and rising and the planet and our oceans will keep getting hotter and hotter. The trend isn’t going to stop now, just for us.
\What’s discouraging is that scientists have been warning about global warming for more than 50 years and it’s been very much in the public eye for 25. The original U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed by 154 nations in 1992, back when George H.W. Bush was president. And what have we done?
\What’s encouraging, on the other hand, is that last December, 195 countries, including the U.S. and China, accepted the Paris Agreement to reduce CO2 emissions. We need to do everything possible to help it succeed. We must tell our representatives that this is a top priority and reject any candidate that supports willful ignorance of climate change. And we must continue to decrease our own personal waste and consumption of fossil fuels. I hope we don’t have to wait for some truly cataclysmic event to finally take this seriously.

\Recently, there were interviews in the News-Miner with people regarding President Obama’s upcoming visit to Alaska related to climate change. Scientists in the 1820s discovered the greenhouse effect was due to CO2 concentrations. In the late 1800s, Alexander Graham Bell wrote that unchecked burning of fossil fuels would have greenhouse effects and advocated the use of alternate energy sources such as solar energy. In the 1980s, scientists found the earth was rapidly warming because of the use of fossil fuels. Much of the increase in CO2 causing global warming is man made from burning of petroleum and coal. 
\The results are well known but still disputed. The petroleum industry has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on disinformation through such groups as the Competitive Enterprise Institute, lobbying and campaign funding of legislators. As the controversy increased, a petroleum executive hired a public relations firm to mount an anti-global warming propaganda effort for $250,000. That was small potatoes — since that time, they have spent very serious money. As exposed by the Freedom of Information Act, oil industry leaders have admitted global warming is occurring as a result of burning fossil fuels. 
\Nearly all major science groups agree we are experiencing increasing destructive global climate change. These include the National Academy of Science, the British Academy of Science and the Union of Concerned Scientists. An excellent book on the subject is “The Weather of the Future,” by Heidi Cullen and also Michael Mann’s book Hockey Stick and the Global Warming Wars. This problem affecting the globe but can be solved, the first step is to recognize it. In the same vein, the Dust Bowl also was a man-made problem that was essentially ignored until the farmland of America was a wasteland. Many of our national leaders are ignoring global warming, and it will be up to us to get them to act.

\The effects of climate change continue to make state and national news daily, which is why it’s good to read about the solutions as well. In Stefan Milkowski’s Thursday, July 16 op-ed, “A conservative approach on climate,” he describes a revenue neutral carbon fee and dividend. As he pointed out, the cost of climate change to Alaskan families is already high and it’s only continuing to rise. But the cost of a revenue-neutral carbon fee is returned to Alaskans in a dividend, and provides the incentive needed to change our energy consumption habits and look at clean, low-carbon energy alternatives — the very actions needed to reduce our contribution to climate change. Why, even ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson said it’s “the most efficient means of reflecting the cost of carbon in all economic decisions.” That’s a surprising endorsement coming from an oil company, but not a bad thing for an oil-dependent economy like Alaska.
\Faced with the rising costs of climate change, let’s take action to address it. We have the ability. Mooney, Rozzell, and Chomicz quoted UAF scientists in their articles; our flagship university leads Alaska in research and innovation. We have the resources. Take a look at the “Renewable Energy Atlas of Alaska.” We have political will. Governor Walker called Alaska “ground zero of climate change.” And this isn’t exactly an untested policy.

\Visit www.climatechange.alaska.gov and the most recent date on the homepage is 2008. You read that right: 2008. Climate change is no less of an issue than it was in 2008. Yet today, nearly seven years later, it still seems as if our state government hasn’t made much progress in addressing the problem. As it so happens, Gov. Sarah Palin established an Alaska Climate Change Subcabinet in 2007 to “develop and implement a comprehensive Alaska Climate Change Strategy.” This subcabinet was promptly nixed by Gov. Sean Parnell, placing Alaska back at square one. 
\With a newly elected governor, Alaskans now have no excuse to avoid the climate change issue any further. And what better way to get back in the game than to reinstitute the taskforce on climate change? Gov. Bill Walker’s transition team recently stated that “inclusion of Alaskans’ expertise ... is critical to ensuring that good decisions are made about our lands, waters, and communities.” This would be exactly the goal of such a taskforce: implement a diverse group of Alaskans to make educated recommendations about climate change. A taskforce wouldn’t singlehandedly defeat climate change, but it would be a step in the right direction, a step which needed to be taken years ago.
\On that note, I speak directly to Gov. Walker: it is time to convene a task force that addresses the causes and consequences of climate change. If Alaska is ever going to effectively combat climate change, there is no better time to start than today.

\FAIRBANKS - Alaska was once the setting for an environmental shift so dramatic it forced people to evacuate the entire North Slope, according to Michael Kunz, an archaeologist with the Bureau of Land Management.
\About 10,000 years ago, a group of hunting people lived on the North Slope, the swath of mostly treeless tundra that extends north from the Brooks Range to the sea. These people, known as Paleoindians, used a chunky ridge of rock west of the Colville River as a hunting lookout. Michael Kunz first discovered stone spear tips at the site, known as the Mesa, in 1978.
\The people of the Mesa lived at a time when the Arctic was undergoing a change similar to what Alaska is undergoing today. As the world emerged from the last ice age, grasslands covered much of the Bering Land Bridge, a swath of land as wide as the distance from Barrow to Homer.
\To survive in a place like the North Slope, where life is dicey in the best of times, humans needed a few things, Kunz said. One was technology, which the Mesa people had in the form of bone needles they used to sew weather-tight clothing. Another vital element was a large, plentiful source of food. Caribou were scarce during the time of the Mesa people, but bison roamed the grasslands in good numbers. Those bison are the key to how climate change affected these ancient Alaskans, Kunz said.
\For many thousands of years, the area that is now Alaska was part of an enormous swath of dry grasslands that made up much of the Bering Land Bridge. About 15,000 years ago, the planet started evolving from the last ice age. Air temperatures became warmer, and things started to change. Glaciers began melting, sea level rose, and salt water slowly drowned the Bering Land Bridge. The encroachment of the ocean caused an increase in precipitation around the North Slope that allowed cottongrass and other sedges to nudge out the grasses preferred by bison.
\About 12,000 years ago, as the North Slope evolved to what it looks like today, bison disappeared. The last evidence of the Mesa Paleoindians comes from around the same time. Kunz thinks the extinction of the bison from the North Slope, along with the simultaneous scarcity of caribou, caused the Mesa people to move or die out.
\“This is totally the effect of the environment,” Kunz said. “Not only did it run the Paleoindians out of there, it made the place unlivable for anyone for 1,500 years.”
\By examining bones and stone tools, archaeologists found that people moved back to the North Slope about the same time caribou returned after what seems like a population crash that lasted more than 3,000 years.
\Kunz pointed out that car exhaust did not trigger the warming that may have chased the Mesa people from the North Slope. He said climate change has occurred many times before and is inevitable today. He suggests that the human species as a whole should think of how it will work around problems, such as rising sea level and the changes in agricultural zones caused by different weather patterns.
\“The system has always been dynamic,” he said. “We’re not going to stop climate change. Just like the Mesa Paleoindians — if you can’t adapt or adjust, you’re going to disappear.”

\When I began gardening in Fairbanks in the 1980s, killing frosts commonly occurred in August. But in recent years, I have been able to harvest well into mid-September. Climatologists tell us that Alaska is warming at twice the global average rate, and gardeners are not the only ones who have noticed. Native elders observe that natural seasonal patterns that have guided subsistence practices for centuries are no longer reliable. Glaciers popular with sightseers (Columbia, Mendenhall and Portage, for example) have receded far from their former scenic viewpoints. Seeing is believing, and perhaps that is why most Alaska residents accept climate warming as fact.
\Alaska is especially vulnerable to climate warming, not only because warming is more rapid here, but because much of our infrastructure is built on on ice-rich soils. As the air warms, the permafrost is thawing and creating something akin to a “spring breakup” that lasts decades instead of mere days as solid (frozen) ground gives way to mud and water. A recent study, “Climate change damages to Alaska public infrastructure and the economics of proactive adaptation,” published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, projected climate change damages to Alaska’s publicly owned buildings, roads, airports and pipelines because of flooding, permafrost thaw, precipitation and freeze-thaw cycles. The predicted price tag from 2015-2099 is in the range of $4.2 billion to $5.5 billion.
\But wait, there’s more! That study left out damage caused by coastal erosion, deep permafrost thaw, damage to village water and sewer systems and disruption of fisheries because of changes in the riverine and marine environment, for starters. Furthermore, damage to privately owned infrastructure — your home or business or the Alyeska Pipeline — wasn’t included. It is easy to extrapolate that the total price tag for Alaska could run into the tens of billions of dollars or higher. What an unfortunate legacy to leave to the next generations!
\Elsewhere in the U.S., local governments are taking threats such as climate-associated sea level rise seriously. Miami Beach is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in pumps and construction projects to raise roadbeds. The city of Boston is contemplating a sea barrier across the harbor estimated to cost tens of billions of dollars. As Alaska’s climate bill comes due, it is unlikely that we will compete successfully for scarce federal dollars compared to these more populous and well-prepared communities. With the state budget in decline, it is probable that local governments will be left grappling with problems whose origins are well beyond their control.
\What can be done? Limiting our future climate change liabilities means limiting carbon emissions, and that is a global problem that can only be addressed at the national and international level. Unfortunately for us, the Trump administration appears poised to reverse U.S. climate policy and to abandon all initiatives intended to reduce carbon emissions. Our congressional delegation has enthusiastically greeted the ascension of climate skeptics such as Scott Pruitt (EPA administrator) into high-level positions in the new administration. Sen. Dan Sullivan has decried the “over-reaching jurisdictional expansion of the EPA’s regulatory authority” in attempting to reduce carbon emissions through its Clean Power Plan.
\Whether there has indeed been overreach is a matter currently working its way through the courts. What is perfectly clear, however, is a history of congressional inaction on the issue of climate change, and our delegation has been complicit. With so much at stake for Alaska, Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and Rep. Don Young should instead be outspoken leaders in a political alliance for sensible climate policies. These include:
\• a robust multi-agency climate science program to better define risks and probable trajectories of environmental change, including a focus on arctic systems;
\• vigorous support for adherence to the 2016 Paris Climate Treaty, our best opportunity to influence actions by other nations which affect us significantly; and
\• strong incentives for development and adoption of energy conservation and renewable energy technologies that will reduce global carbon emissions, create new jobs and lower the staggering energy costs that currently afflict our communities and families.
\We are at a critical political juncture, with Washington. D.C., politicians charting a course that threatens our economy and natural resources. Doing nothing is not without cost. It is time for Alaska’s political leaders to stop passing the buck to our children and grandchildren.

\Alaska Native villages face some of the highest climate change risks in the nation due to their eroding and flooding shorelines, limited resources, impacts of colonization and strong connection to traditional lands, waters and wildlife they do not wish to leave behind. Some Alaska coastal villages are expected to be underwater as early as the 2020s. Every article that appears on this subject evokes fierce debate about whether saving these communities merit spending hundreds of millions of dollars for relocation.
\Let me first disclose my bias on this issue before moving to a much bigger issue. I believe that climate justice offers a reason for Alaskans and Americans to empower Alaska Native village adaptation. Many Alaska Native villages did not choose to give up their adaptive lifestyles in favor of permanent settlements on lands that were never suitable for this purpose. Settlement was required by U.S. law and policies. Further, the American people as a whole (and particularly Alaskans) have benefited from our historic and current contributions to climate change.
\Despite the many legal and practical challenges to relocation that Native villages face, the task is not impossible and need not take away funding from other Alaska communities. The Native village of Eagle was able to completely relocate after an ice jam in 2009, using hazard mitigation funds provided by the Federal Emergency Management Act (FEMA). Grants offered through FEMA’s Pre-Disaster Hazard Mitigation program, the Indian Community Development Block Grant program, and the Natural Resources Conservation Service’s Emergency Watershed Protection Program may provide a starting point for other Native villages prior to a flooding disaster.
\But before we arm ourselves to fight in favor or against government-assisted relocation, let’s step back and consider the larger question of the best ways to provide for adaptation. Not every Native village needs or wants to relocate. Villages like Shaktoolik have been working on practical measures to stay in place as long as possible, including the construction of a coastal berm out of local materials and plans for a local evacuation mound that can provide refuge during a severe flood. Villages like Nulato and Allakaket have been moving on a gradual basis, providing for new housing to be constructed on adjacent high ground not vulnerable to flooding. 
\While our laws pertaining to climate change and related disasters are certainly ripe for amendments, there is much that can be done within the existing framework. One of the first steps is to better understand how Native villages are actually managing adaptation challenges on their own, instead of just focusing on how difficult climate change impacts can be. The next step is to establish forums where these communities can share strategies with each other and improve communication with outside agencies and entities that can offer assistance with implementing these strategies. Returning to my earlier point about climate justice, it is essential that the voice and knowledge of Alaska Native villages not be lost in the process.

\“Think global, act local” is a cliché, but it’s also a reality for borough, city and village leaders across Alaska who must confront the direct impacts of global climate change. Left with few choices, local leaders and their constituents are developing new and innovative ways to protect and preserve their communities. 
\Climate change has become a hot-button political issue at the national and state levels, and attempts to address it have been delayed — even pushed aside — by partisanship. Political blockades have thwarted most attempts to set national policy.
\Local leaders can’t wait for the federal government and many state governments to adopt tighter emissions standards, emergency management practices or other mitigations. Alaskans have confronted firsthand the damaging ice jams, thawing permafrost, destructive coastal erosion, devastating wildfires and other real problems. The effects of climate change are well-known and observed daily. 
\Local governments cannot afford to debate whether climate change is lasting or just temporary, whether it is naturally occurring or produced by human activity, whether it will last 50 years or more than 100. Regardless who or what is to blame, local governments have to take action. Roads and utility lines, homes and offices, schools and hospitals must be maintained and protected. 
\While citizens are cynical about “big government,” they still expect their local governments to work efficiently and deliver direct services.
\For local leaders, climate change is not a political football or snippy sound bite. Their communities cannot afford such behavior. Climate change and its impacts present life and property decisions that can harm, even ruin communities and their services. No mayor can stand on the sidelines watching city streets wash out to sea. While politicians in Washington, D.C., talk, Alaska communities must react. 
\Alaska’s boroughs, cities and villages are responsible for protecting lives and property every day. Beyond the routine fire and police calls, this includes wildfires, floods, coastal erosion and extreme storms. Not only do local governments respond to disasters and damage, they plan ahead to take action to reduce the severity of these events and build more resilient communities.
\Alaska’s local governments know that doing something today to adapt, address and lessen the damages of climate change makes tomorrow’s risks easier to manage, while saving current and future taxpayer dollars in the process.
\When Sitka finished the expansion of its Blue Lake Hydroelectric Dam, it obtained a source of affordable, fish-friendly, clean energy for generations to come. With no federal funding and only one-third state funding, the community made it happen by accepting higher utility bills now for greater benefits in the future. 
\When Galena was hit with record-breaking floods, the city manager and mayor worked with construction companies, neighbors and charities to bring back electricity, potable water, facilities for elders, and even softball fields and the indoor pool. Shelters and living accommodations were rebuilt and community morale was restored when local officials found solutions.
\When the Fairbanks North Star Borough (FNSB) renovated its school facilities, it reduced the energy use rate per square foot to one of the lowest in the state. The Alaska Housing Finance Corporation acknowledged the major gains from the reduced energy footprint. FNSB also installed energy efficient lighting in most borough facilities to save electrical energy costs and converted many of its large public buildings from fuel oil to clean-burning natural gas.
\With natural gas, communities in Interior Alaska are committed to improving the air quality, and reducing airborne particulates and sulfur emissions, which benefits the health of all residents. 
\Investments in disaster resilience, such as earthquake-resistant designs for public buildings, recognize that every $1 spent on mitigation returns at least a 10-fold benefit in reduced post-
\disaster rebuilding and repair costs. 
\Instead of endlessly debating an issue that is already occurring before our eyes, Alaska’s local governments are taking action to protect the public — and taxpayer investments — by building disaster-resilient communities. 
\State and federal lawmakers and agency officials can learn from Alaska’s local leaders. The lessons are straightforward: Stop fighting science, stop the distraction of dueling experts, stop the made-for-TV accusations and stop the partisanship. The time has arrived for definitive action to preserve and protect our communities.

\First, let’s get one thing straight. Despite what you may have heard, it is cow burps, not cow farts, that are the real climate change problem.
\Here’s how it works: Cows digest their food in four-part stomachs, including a “rumen,” which is a site that allows for fermentation — a process that gives off a lot of carbon dioxide and methane gas, as microorganisms aid in the process of digestion. That gas has to get out of the cow’s body somehow — hence, burps. “Approximately 132 to 264 gallons of ruminal gas produced by fermentation are belched each day,” notes the Penn State College of Agricultural Sciences.
\And because we have so many cows — where would human civilization be without them? — this really adds up. Indeed, according to the EPA, so-called “enteric fermentation” in cows and other ruminant animals, like sheep and goats, contributed 26 percent of the country’s total emissions of methane, a hard-hitting greenhouse gas with much greater short-term warming consequences than carbon dioxide does (though the latter packs a far greater long-term punch).
\Globally, meanwhile, methane emissions from livestock are an even bigger problem. Overall, the livestock supply chain emits 44 percent of the globe’s human-caused methane, according to the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization — and a large slice of that comes from cattle’s methane burps. So anything you could do to cut down on cow belching would, literally, help save the planet.
\The ideas for how to do this have been numerous — and sometimes hilarious. We’ve heard about cow backpacks, for instance, to capture methane and put it to use. And there are also more mundane solutions like simple “husbandry,” says Johan Kuylenstierna, policy director of the Stockholm Environment Institute.
\“You could reduce emission intensities — i.e. emissions per kg meat or milk, by about 30 percent if people in a given region adopted the good practices of the top 10 percent of farmers that have the lowest methane emissions,” Kuylenstierna says by email, citing the FAO. This includes keeping animals healthier, giving them better diets, and managing their reproduction to lower their overall emissions.
\But one fundamental way of fixing the problem involves trying to change the chemistry of what’s happening in cows’ rumens — after all, methane emissions represent lost food energy that could have gone towards cow growth or milk production. For some time, Dutch life sciences and materials company DSM has been pursuing such a solution, which it appropriately calls its “Clean Cow” project.
\DSM is a Netherlands-based life and materials sciences giant with 10 billion euros (about $11 billion) in annual sales — including 32 percent of its market in animal feed. The company has created a powder that can be added to cow feed that, it says, can produce “a reduction of over 30 percent in methane emissions with no negative impact on animal welfare, performance, or the amount of feed they consume.” And now, newly published science backs this idea up.
\DSM worked with a top dairy sciences researcher who focuses on methane emissions, Alexander Hristov of Penn State University, to study the clean cow technology — what they more technically called a “methane inhibitor.” And they got promising results.
\Hristov and colleagues, including several researchers from DSM, designed and carried out a trial in which 48 cows, receiving varying amounts of the inhibitor in their feed, were observed over 12 weeks. Their methane emissions were measured when they put their heads into feeding chambers which also had atmospheric measurement sensors, and also through nostril tubes attached to canisters on the backs of the cows.
\The result was that the inhibitor “decreased methane emissions from high-producing dairy cows by 30 percent,” the research found.
\The substance “blocks one of the steps of the enzymatic process that produces methane from carbon dioxide and hydrogen,” explains Hristov. And he notes that in that process, energy is actually being lost in the form of methane. So with less methane generated, Hristov says, the cow has more energy that can instead be converted to growth and milk production.
\“In our case, that energy didn’t go to milk production, but the cows actually gained more body weight, basically the energy was directed towards body weight gain,” says Hristov. The published study discloses that the research was partially supported by DSM.
\The real trick may be getting farmers to adopt the technology — but according to Hugh Welsh, president of DSM North America, they may ultimately have an economic incentive for doing so.
\“We’re looking to a day when there really will be a price on carbon, or where a farmer will be able to sell carbon credits for using this in his feed,” says Welsh. He says the company hopes to be able to take the inhibitor commercial by 2018.
\So in sum, cows remain a major contributor to climate change, and just as with caps on tailpipe and smokestack emissions, we will need to find a way to curb that contribution. There are many contending solutions — but perhaps the fix will turn on changing what’s happening in a cow’s stomach.

\Sen. Lisa Murkowski soon will chair the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. I was dismayed to hear her recent analysis that, although climate change is a serious issue, it may have less to do with human carbon emissions and more to do with natural causes, in particular volcanoes.
\Sen. Murkowski’s apparent implication that climate change is not man-made is wrong. There is nearly a scientific consensus that recent global warming is a man-made phenomenon. It is also a misguided attempt to shift the discussion away from reversing climate change toward accepting it as inevitable and learning to cope.
\I am not angry with Sen. Murkowski. She is a good person and a pragmatic politician. I also have no truck with those who stupidly argue that she and the Republican-led Senate will eschew sensible policies for the sake of power and profit.
\Instead of angry, I am scared. I am scared of more droughts in dry places of the world, and more cataclysmic floods in wetter regions. I am scared of waking up one morning 30 years from now and learning that climate change and all its ills are truly irreversible. I am scared of raising my children in a world that is worse off than the one we have now.
\Most of all, I am scared by Sen. Murkowski’s implication that mankind cannot stop global warming. I have such hope in our potential. Renewable energy is getting cheaper and better. The United Nations is taking another stab at an agreement to cut emissions. Scientists, engineers and businesses across the globe are developing technologies to make our energy cleaner. But all this potential is worthless if we accept massive climate change as inevitable and learn instead how to cope.
\Sen. Murkowski has a crucial role to play in all this. If she can be brave enough to argue climate change is manmade, and mankind can undo the damage, then we will all be better off. Future generations will thank her for displaying the courage it takes to save the world.

","Julie Collins, for the News-Miner","Oct 21, 2017","Top of Form
\Bottom of Form
\Lake Minchumina — Numerous natural events hinge on a single degree, the difference between freezing and thawing. As the autumn sun dips ever closer to the horizon and the nights grow longer, we shift our attention from fall to winter, from gardening and moose hunting to fishing and trapping. At least, that’s the plan. Since roughly the turn of the millennium, the seasonal progression has usually stalled out during the fall — the “extended shoulder season” predicted by climate scientists.
\We once preferred waiting to pick cranberries until the first frost sweetened the berries. We pulled potatoes after that first frost wilted the vines. We hunted moose after nightly frosts intensified the rut, making bulls easy to find, and often left some meat hanging outside until it froze with the approaching winter. We pulled carrots in mid-September before the ground froze for the winter, and switched the sled dogs from water cans to morning soup when the cans froze.
\We usually pulled our fish net right before the lake froze, and made a final trip across the lake to the post office before cranking the boat out one last time, hauling it high above the reach of drifting spring ice. Before the turn of the millennium, we often boated to mail one freezing early-October day, and ran the dogs along the frozen lake edge to the post office just a few days later.
\Of course, every year presents different weather, but a pattern has emerged in recent decades in which the first September frost occurs at the end of the month instead of the beginning or is even delayed until mid-October.
\When the temperature crosses a critical boundary from daily thawing to remaining frozen, winter arrives in earnest. That used to happen during the first half of October. Occasionally, it still does happen at the normal time. But more often, our fall weather continues almost until Halloween.
\This unpleasant in-between weather extends freeze-up for weeks, and some ground-water creeks do not freeze until late December.
\Ten or 15 years ago, we were forced to delay trapping into mid- or late November because the rivers hadn’t frozen yet, and while that problem continues, in recent years we’ve been forced to delay trapping even into December because the lack of snow makes travel too difficult and dangerous.
\When the temperature drops below that critical point of freezing, the silty river delta that flanks our yard freezes. At that point the water that normally clings to fine silt and sticks it firmly to the ground will pull away to form ice, leaving the suddenly-dry powder free to lift and flow in the wind. The resulting dust storms during big blows might continue into late November on snow-free years, saturating everything from firewood to snow machines and outdoor gear.
\Worse yet are the unprecedented November rain storms that have slammed us several times since 2010. That single degree between freezing and melting allows water instead of snow to cover the frozen ground. Ice glazes any valuables left uncovered, from airplanes and snow machines to fire wood and dog houses. The accumulated water floods onto lakes and rivers to create massive overflows. Unlike the light, soft insulating cover of snow, the ice allows cold to penetrate the leaf litter, making life hard on animals like voles and grouse who normally burrow under the snow to stay warm.
\Another big effect created by that one degree between freezing and thawing over a long time period is the melting of permafrost. In our area, most of the vast permafrost fields are less than a single degree below freezing, and with continued warm weather we’ve seen more and more slumps, erosions, and upheavals from collapsing permafrost, which make wilderness travel rough and often dangerous.
\These days we feel it’s pretty pointless to wait for a frost to pick cranberries; the grouse and bears consume most of them before the delayed frost, and the rest are covered with fallen leaves by the time the berries turn sweet. We occasionally leave root vegetables in the ground into October as the weeks trickle by without a hard freeze.
\After taking roughly 28 moose in 30 years, for four of the last eight years we’ve been unable to find a moose for winter meat. (This is due only partly to the delayed rut; it’s also from arthritis problems and outside hunting pressure.) These days we don’t dare leave much meat hanging because it could be six weeks until it freezes outside.
\Managing the fish net poses quite a problem when the normal fall temperature decline stalls right at freezing, not for days but for weeks. We don’t want it to freeze into the ice, but if we pull the net out to wait for safe ice, we won’t have fish to feed the huskies. We used to pull the net when breaking waves began freezing on the lakeshore, but while that once meant an imminent freeze, when the thermometer just won’t settle enough for the main lake to freeze we could go for three weeks without a fish net, and that’s an awful long time to spend over $30 per day on commercial dog food.
\All too often we crank the boat out for the winter, only to lever it back into the water days later because the lake still hasn’t frozen.
\Delays, silt storms, winter rains, spoiling meat, disintegrating permafrost — what a difference a degree makes.
\Trappers and lifelong Bush residents Miki and Julie Collins have written three books, which are available at Gulliver’s Books in Fairbanks. They live in Lake Minchumina.

\Bottom of Form
\FAIRBANKS — Free screenings of a new documentary that highlights climate change in Alaska will be offered this week in Fairbanks, Palmer, Anchorage and Kotzebue.
\“Between Earth and Sky: Climate Change on the Last Frontier” was shown in Kotzebue Wednesday and is showing at at the University of Alaska Fairbanks tonight, in Anchorageon Friday and in Palmer on Saturday.
\Texas Tech Public Media produced the documentary, which was released in March and has been shown at environmental film festivals, more than a dozen universities in the Lower 48 and in Europe and on public broadcasting stations.
\The documentary mixes interviews with Alaska scientists and climate change experts with the stories of Alaska residents affected by climate change. Scenic footage from across the state provides a backdrop as people talk about the shifting route for the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, receding glaciers, coastal storms, erosion, wildfires and melting permafrost.
\Executive producer David Weindorf said the movie was inspired by now-retired University of Alaska Fairbanks soils scientist Chien-Lu Ping and his 33 years of soils research. Ping started an annual Arctic soils field tour in 1989 and his last field trip, in 2015, was documented by the film crew.
\Weindorf, a soil scientist and associate dean of research at Texas Tech University, participated in the tour with his students for more than 10 years and will help teach the class next year. He said the field trip attracted students and scientists from Italy, Japan and across the U.S. who wanted to learn from the soil scientist.
\“What an international impact Chien-Lu has had,” Weindorf said. “He brought all of those people together.”
\Weindorf said Ping identified many unique features of Arctic soils, including the high percentage of carbon. Weindorf said that’s important because 40 percent of the world’s carbon is tied up in subarctic and Arctic soils, and as temperatures warm, soils release carbon into the atmosphere, which contributes to the warming.
\Weindorf has produced a second documentary that focused exclusively on Ping and on the field tour. “Between Earth and Sky: An Arctic Soils Perspective” is a more technical film and geared more to student in soils and environmental sciences.
\The climate-change movie will be shown at 7 p.m. Sept. 27 at the Northwest Arctic Heritage Center in Kotzebue; at 5:30 p.m. Sept. 28 at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Murie auditorium; at 2:30 p.m. Sept. 29 at the Bear Tooth Theatre in Anchorage; and at 7:30 p.m. Sept. 30 at the Glen Massey Theater in Palmer. Weindorf will be at all the screenings and he will answer questions following the shows, joined in some locations by other scientists.
\The documentary was directed by Paul Allen Hunton, the general manager of a Texas public television station, who has won three Emmys for his work as a documentary filmmaker.
\The documentary is funded by the USDA National Resources Conservation Service, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Texas Tech Public Media, Soil Science Society of America and the BL Allen Endowment in Pedology. The Fairbanks showing is sponsored by the Resource Management Society, a UAF student group. More information is available on the film’s website, betweenearthwandskymovie.com.

\NEW YORK (AP) — Climate change is one of the main characters in the new season of ""Deadliest Catch,"" with the crab fishermen in one of Discovery's most enduring and popular shows forced to deal with a sudden warming of the Bering Sea that chases their prey into deeper, more dangerous water.
\That leads the adventure series into its own uncharted waters. The show's 13th season debuts Tuesday at 9 p.m.
\""It's a big risk for us to discuss climate change because so many people can think that it's a political issue when really it isn't, particularly in the context of the fishing fleet,"" said R. Decker Watson, Jr., one of the show's executive producers.
\The waters off Alaska that provide the livelihood for the show's real-life stars warmed by a dramatic 4 degrees in one year. The cold water-loving crab is depleted in the traditional fishing areas, so some of the boats strike out for new territory that is more dangerous because of fiercer storms and is further from rescue workers if something goes wrong, he said.
\In fact, the new season documents one vessel lost at sea. It was not one of the crews regularly featured in the series, but all of the regulars knew who was involved, he said.
\The developments offer an opportunity to educate an audience that might be less familiar about climate change. The median age of a ""Deadliest Catch"" viewer is 50 and the show skews 60 percent male which, judging by the results of the last election, might include its share of climate change skeptics. Yet Discovery isn't interested in preaching; the series is more interested in documenting what is happening, not in explaining why.
\There are no scientists aboard the fishing boats, and the show's main purpose is to follow the lives of the crew, said Rich Ross, Discovery president.
\""At the end of the day, the job of 'Deadliest Catch' isn't to teach people, it's to keep people at the edge of their seats,"" Watson said.
\The season-opener of ""Deadliest Catch"" comes two days before Discovery airs the documentary, ""Sacred Cod,"" about the collapse of the cod fishing industry in New England.
\Earlier this decade, with the documentary series ""Frozen Earth,"" some environmentalists criticized Discovery for side-stepping issues surrounding global warming. But at the end of 2015, the network aired the pointed documentary ""Racing Extinction"" about the depleting of species simultaneously in 220 markets around the world.
\At a presentation for advertisers recently, Discovery Communications announced a multi-million dollar effort to fund a project that helps to restore the population of wild tigers in India. The project wasn't picked to avoid the larger, more contentious topic of climate change, but rather to go after a narrower, specific issue with an immediate chance of making a difference, said David Leavy, Discovery's chief corporate operations officer.
\The show's new season isn't all about missing fish, as it documents the personalities of the men involved in the dangerous pursuit. One captain, Sig Hansen, narrowly survived a heart attack and this season is contemplating how long he wants to keep fishing.
\Watson has worked his way up from being one of the filmmakers on a fishing boat to one of the show's leaders, and he feels a personal stake in what's happening in the Bering Sea and on the planet in general.
\""When something like this comes up, it's felt by all of us,"" he said. ""I love making this show, and so does the rest of my team. We look forward to going back to Dutch Harbor every year. There's something special about it.""

\Bottom of Form
\WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump's choice to head the Interior Department on Tuesday rejected the president-elect's claim that climate change is a hoax, saying it is indisputable that environmental changes are affecting the world's temperature and human activity is a major reason.
\""I don't believe it's a hoax,"" Rep. Ryan Zinke told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee at his confirmation hearing.
\""The climate is changing. The debate is what is that influence and what can we do,"" said the Montana Republican.
\Trump has suggested in recent weeks he's keeping an open mind on the issue and may reconsider a campaign pledge to back away from a 2015 Paris agreement that calls for global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
\In contradicting Trump, Zinke cited Glacier National Park in his home state as a prime example of the effects of climate change, noting that glaciers there have receded in his lifetime and even from one visit to the next.
\Still, he told Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that there is debate about how much humans have influenced the climate.
\Likely to win Senate confirmation, Zinke sketched out a variety of purposes for the nation's vast federal lands, from hiking, hunting, fishing and camping to harvesting timber and mining for coal and other energy sources.
\An admirer of President Theodore Roosevelt, Zinke said management of federal lands should be done under a ""multiple-use"" model set forth by Gifford Pinchot, a longtime Roosevelt associate and the first chief of the U.S. Forest Service.
\Zinke also pledged to tackle an estimated $12 billion backlog in maintenance and repair at national parks, saying parks and other public lands should be a key part of Trump's infrastructure improvement plan.
\Zinke has said he would never sell, give away or transfer public lands — a crucial stance in his home state of Montana and the rest of the West where access to hunting and fishing is considered sacrosanct.
\Zinke feels so strongly that he resigned as a delegate to the Republican National Convention last summer because of the GOP's position in favor of land transfers to state or private groups. But Zinke's commitment to public lands has come into question in recent weeks.
\The Interior Department and other U.S. agencies control almost a third of land in the West and even more of the underground ""mineral estate"" that holds vast amounts of coal, oil and natural gas.
\Zinke's position on public lands came under fire after he voted in favor of a measure from House Republicans that would allow federal land transfers to be considered cost-free and budget-neutral, making it easier for drilling and development.
\Zinke ""says he's against transfer of federal lands, but there's a big gap between what he says and what he does in that regard,"" said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, the nation's oldest and largest environmental group.
\Zinke told senators Tuesday that he flatly opposes all sales or transfer of federal lands.
\Indeed, his support for public lands was a crucial reason why Zinke was chosen by Trump. The president-elect and son Donald Trump Jr. both oppose sale of federal lands. The younger Trump, an avid hunter, has taken a keen interest in Interior Department issues and played a key role in Zinke's selection.
\Zinke also reiterated his support for coal production on federal lands as part of an all-of-the above energy strategy
\Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, the top Democrat on the energy panel, asked Zinke about modernizing the federal coal program, saying it was important ""to make sure American taxpayers aren't short-changed for the benefit of corporate interests
\Zinke promised to review the coal program and said he thinks taxpayers ""should always get fair value,"" whether it's coal, wind power or other energy sources.

37,AK,"Above the Arctic Circle, climate change closes in on Barrow
","Adam Popescu, Special to The Washington Post","Sep 12, 2016","BARROW, Alaska — Here in the northernmost municipality of the United States, 320 miles above the Arctic Circle, people are facing the idea that they may soon be among the world's first climate-change refugees.
\Warming air, melting permafrost and rising sea levels are threatening their coastline, and researchers predict that by midcentury, the homes, schools and land around Barrow and its eight surrounding villages will be underwater. This despite decades of erecting barriers, dredging soil and building berms to hold back the water.
\""The coastline is backing up at rates of [30 to 65 feet] per year,"" says Robert Anderson, a University of Boulder geomorphologist who has studied Alaska's landscape evolution since 1985 and who first noticed in the early 2000s how alarming the erosion was becoming. ""It's baffling.""
\When the sea ice melts, the coast becomes exposed to waves, wind and storms that slam into the shore, causing erosion. As ice moves farther from shore, waves can be as high as 20 feet when they reach land, Anderson says.
\""The only thing we can do, as far as I'm concerned, is move our towns inland,"" says Mike Aamodt, the former acting mayor of Barrow and its surrounding villages of the North Slope Borough, which stretches over 89,000 square miles, an area larger than Utah.
\Pointing out a window in his second-floor office, Aamodt isn't joking when he declares that the sole refuge from erosion and rising seas is the Brooks mountain range — more than 250 miles south.
\Barrow, with a population of just over 4,000, is as remote as it gets. There are no roads leading in, and it's accessible only by air and, during the summer months, by sea. There's a post office, a police station, a fire station and a high school with an indoor track and a swimming pool for its 200 students, plus a rec center, a 14-bed hospital, a few churches and a handful of mom-and-pop restaurants. There's no movie theater for 1,000 miles, no bars (or legal alcohol sales), no nightlife to speak of.
\There are oil fields 200 miles to the east in Prudhoe Bay, but aside from a few corporate logos on buildings, there's no sign of Big Oil in town. Most visitors come here to experience the stark beauty and power of nature — seas so iced-over in winter that you can walk on them for miles, tundra brown and green in summer, and the stunning variety of animals, including whales, seals, caribou, polar bears and walrus.
\Scientists flock here to study climate change. Low temperatures average nearly 20 degrees below zero in winter; summer highs are mostly in the 40s, though it reached 79 once in 1993. Locals — and hard data — say there's less snow and ice now than ever before.
\The area has long been home to Inupiaq natives who have lived off the abundant marine life. Modern Barrow was built on commercial whaling in the late 1800s, but there's evidence of indigenous settlements going back as far as 800 A.D. The giant bowhead whales native to this part of the Arctic are actually prospering with warming seas here. But it's a different question for the humans.
\A stroll along one of Barrow's handful of roads shows just how tenuous civilization's perch is. Bulldozed mounds of sand and soil more than 20 feet high are all around town. But these sea walls are frequently penetrated as swells and storms overtop the walls, sometimes sending houses, built on stilts because of the impenetrability of permafrost, floating inland for miles.
\With ocean to the north and half a dozen major lagoons and lakes to the south and east, Barrow's residents face danger on all sides. Yet the biggest worry may be from the ground itself.
\""Sometimes I have that eerie feeling — I'm, like, 'Oh gosh, we're on the permafrost,' "" says Diana Martin, a Barrow-born Inupiaq who works in the town's museum, over a bowl of caribou soup at her sister's home about a mile from the coast. ""What if we start floating away?""
\Science backs up her concern: This year is on pace to be the hottest on record.
\As air and sea temperatures have notched up, there has been a warming of the permafrost, the thousands-of-years-old subsurface layer of frozen soil, rocks and water. That layer can be as much as 2,000 feet deep in parts of this area.
\Gary Clow, a U.S. Geological Survey geophysicistwho has spent 30 years measuring temperature here, says permafrost has warmed about 5 degrees since 1990. That makes soil soften, rise and shift, which Aamodt says affects everything that has been built on it: utility systems, roads, airports.
\It's a change Aamodt fears: If fuel dumps or sewage lines leak into freshwater sources, major pollution ensues. With hundreds of miles of coast not many feet above sea level, the potential impact on health and lives is great.
\When cyclones came through in 2000 and 2004, knocking out Barrow's power supply, the result was flooded and contaminated drinking water. States of emergency are common occurrences here, and given the rising seas and coastal erosion, every year brings the threat of a storm that could wipe the town off the map, Aamodt says.
\Barrow's climate-change problem has been years in the making, says Anne Jensen, an ethnographic archaeologist who arrived in Barrow in 1983 and has been excavating some of the earliest human settlements found in this frigid area.
\The increasing floods and erosion have made her job a scramble against nature. By the time she secures funding and gets ready to enlarge a dig, a site that is often now at water's edge, surging oceans washes everything away. It's a frustrating way to make a living, she says. ""The entire north coast of the North Slope — most of the sites are already gone. We have a big knowledge gap up there.""
\Faced with what they see as the inevitable, some people have begun relocating inland. Aamodt has moved his hunting cabin six times since the 1970s. When we speak, he shakes his head, wishing that it would be as easy and affordable to pick up and move Barrow and its neighboring communities.
\Moving any one of these towns, though, would require more resources than the state or federal government would be willing to provide, he says. Relocation is already being planned in other parts of Alaska, including one town 400 miles south of here on the Bering Sea. And although President Barack Obama has earmarked hundreds of millions of dollars to help communities facing the impact of the changing climate, that won't be enough, Aamodt says.
\At $403 million, the borough's annual budget ‚ much of it funded by a tax on oil and gas development in Prudhoe Bay — sounds enormous, but it's only enough to keep these far-flung hamlets going in their harsh environment.
\One of Barrow's nearby villages, Point Lay, ""is [a mere] 400 people, 40 houses, big buildings, an underground utility system, pipes,"" he says. But it's ""probably $500 million to move that town. Then we have Wainwright: We need to move that town, too. It's on a bluff right against the ocean. That's 700 people, so I imagine $700 [million] to $800 million.""
\Aamodt takes off his glasses, then stares out the window toward the sea, quite calm on this afternoon. There's no magic rescue, he says. There's not even a Coast Guard outpost here should watery disaster strike: The closest is 1,000 miles away. Locals, known for extreme self-reliance, feel as if they are being left on their own to face a future as refugees from climate change.
\Can these towns be saved? Aamodt fidgets in his seat, looking down. ""It's fruitless to even think about it,"" he replies. ""Our turn is coming. That could happen this year. It's inevitable.""

38,AK,"As governor, Sarah Palin believed in climate change
",By Rick Steiner,"May 20, 2016","Top of Form
\Bottom of Form
\Since her meteoric rise to fame in the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has been a leading voice in the climate change denial movement. Celebrity and ignorance are a dangerous mixture. 
\Ms. Palin claims that climate change is a hoax, snake oil, junk science and a left-wing conspiracy to shut down development. After a late season snowfall in southern Alaska in 2013, she wrote on her Facebook page: “Global warming my gluteus maximus.” And Ms. Palin is now using her tabloid, televangelist fame to promote the most recent climate change denial effort, the flagrantly inaccurate film “Climate Hustle.” 
\But surprisingly, Ms. Palin wasn’t always a voice of ignorance on climate change. Before she went down the Tea Party rabbit hole in 2008, into the fantasy world of climate change denial devoid of fact, science, or reason, Palin actually believed the science of climate change and the necessary governmental response. 
\As governor of Alaska in 2007, she issued Administrative Order No. 238, establishing the Alaska Climate Change Sub-Cabinet, which she tasked with developing and implementing an Alaska Climate Change Strategy. This is some of what Gov. Palin stated in that order:
\“Scientific evidence shows many areas of Alaska are experiencing a warming trend. Many experts predict that Alaska, along with our northern latitude neighbors, will continue to warm at a faster pace than any other state, and the warming will continue for decades. Climate change is not just an environmental issue. It is also a social, cultural, and economic issue important to all Alaskans. As a result of this warming, coastal erosion, thawing permafrost, retreating sea ice, record forest fires, and other changes are affecting, and will continue to affect, the lifestyles and livelihoods of Alaskans. Alaska needs a strategy to identify and mitigate potential impacts of climate change and to guide its efforts in evaluating and addressing known or suspected causes of climate change.”
\Palin’s 2007 climate change order directed her new sub-cabinet to, among other things, focus efforts on the following:
\“The prioritization of climate change research in Alaska; development of an action plan addressing climate change impacts on coastal and other vulnerable communities in Alaska; policies and measures to reduce the likelihood or magnitude of damage to infrastructure in Alaska from the effects of climate change; the potential benefits of Alaska participating in regional, national, and international climate policy agreements and greenhouse gas registries; the opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and the opportunities for Alaska to participate in carbon-trading markets, including the offering of carbon sequestration.”
\At that time, Ms. Palin seemed a true believer in the science, impacts, risks and necessary responses to climate change. In fact, Palin’s Climate Change Sub-Cabinet did some excellent initial work on the issue and developed a robust Alaska Climate Change Strategy.
\Then came her trip down the rabbit hole in 2008, where she and her supporters have been stuck ever since. Her adoring fans wanted to be told a fairy tale on the climate issue, and she has been more than willing to oblige.
\Of course since that time, climate change has gone from bad to worse in Alaska. Unfortunately, these earlier efforts to address the issue here have been entirely ignored in the oil politics of Alaska today. Although Palin’s administrative order is still on the books, Gov. Sean Parnell ignored it entirely — as has Gov. Bill Walker, so far.
\It may be too much to hope for, but on an issue so dangerous to the future of human civilization and the biosphere, it would be wonderful if Ms. Palin would come back into the light of science and reason and re-join society’s urgent fight for climate stability, reduced carbon emissions, clean energy and a sustainable future. Regardless, it is long past time for Gov. Walker to attend to this issue with the urgency it demands.

39,AK,"An oilman's $7 billion lesson in the economics of climate change
","Steven Mufson, The Washington Post","Mar 11, 2016","Top of Form
\Bottom of Form
\PHILADELPHIA - Marvin Odum, president of Shell Oil, was attending a meeting of the parent company's executive committee in Singapore when word trickled in that an exploration well drilled in Alaska's Chukchi Sea - the crowning step in a multi-year $7 billion quest - was a dry hole.
\Maybe not bone dry. In a recent interview, Odum wouldn't say. But in the oil business glossary, a dry hole is one that can't pay off commercially, and Shell's hole definitely qualified. The parent company, Royal Dutch Shell, abruptly dropped any further drilling - a setback for the industry, though a relief for environmentalists.
\For years, they had fought a vigorous, litigious and politically intense battle over the Chukchi. Meanwhile Shell, lured by potentially rich rewards, had overcome a couple of embarrassing rig mishaps at sea and patiently navigated the courts and the Obama administration's permitting process. Now, geology had rendered its verdict.
\Odum, who subsequently announced that he would be retiring at the end of this month, said the news about the well didn't hit all at once, but that the drilling results and analysis came in small, painful drips over several days of the executive committee meeting.
\Odum knows all too well the element of chance that drives the oil-drilling business. The mechanical engineer has spent his entire 34-year working life at Shell and has overseen successful exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. (About a third of Shell's capital spending goes to North America.) The tools of the trade have grown more sophisticated over time, with computer-aided seismic surveys that can give exploration companies detailed three-dimensional, multicolored maps of the subsurface. Still, at the end of the day, there is only one way to find out for certain whether oil or natural gas is lurking deep in the Earth.
\""Through geology and seismic surveys, we had reduced the risk to where the only way to reduce it more was to put down a well,"" Odum said, adding that Shell put it ""where we thought there was the highest prospect"" of a discovery. If they had been correct, Odum said, the reward could have been fields as rich in oil as the Gulf of Mexico, which produces 1.6 million barrels a day worth $22 billion a year, even at today's depressed prices.
\""The size of the prize was always big enough to take that next step and find out for sure,"" he said.
\Odum took time to reflect during a recent visit to the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Odum's departure has saddened many at Shell who see him as, well, a nice guy. He says now is a logical time to leave Shell, which hired him on the spot during the one and only job interview of his life. His father also did some work for Shell, devising a specially fitted type of steel pipe that made drilling easier - and which NASA later used, too.
\But now, Royal Dutch Shell is undergoing a massive reorganization to gird itself for a more climate-conscious world, but one that Shell says will still need vast quantities of fossil fuels.
\With the recent $52 billion acquisition of the British BG Group, Royal Dutch Shell is making liquefied natural gas a bigger part of its future. It also picked up alluring deepwater oil fields off Brazil. It has reorganized its lines of management by function, rather than geography. And it is planning to sell $30 billion in assets over the next three years, twice the normal rate.
\That could include some items in North America.
\To many analysts, it looked like Odum was pushed into leaving. ""He's a very competent guy. Very low key and sure of himself,"" said Fadel Gheit, oil analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. ""But unfortunately for him, the results were pretty bad. It's basically on his watch.""
\Gheit said the drilling rig mishaps at sea cost hundreds of millions of dollars and, back on the mainland, Shell had to write down the value of shale oil and gas properties. But, he added, these setbacks were ""not entirely his fault.""
\Odum says that while he's not rushing into anything, he plans to find new work in the oil business. He also plans to spend more time with his new grandson, his golf clubs, his cello (an eight-year-old Christmas present he's just learning) and his three motorcycles - a Harley-Davidson, a BMW and a Ducati. ""I love riding. It's the engineer in me,"" he said.
\- - -
\The night before Odum arrived at the University of Pennsylvania, students from the Penn Sustainability Review, an environmental publication, met to figure out how to pressure the university into selling the endowment's investments in fossil fuel companies.
\Last year, 88 percent of Penn undergraduates who voted in a referendum favored divestment from fossil fuels. (A third of undergraduates voted.) Similar measures are sweeping across college campuses, efforts that in some ways resemble the anti-apartheid disinvestment campaigns aimed at South Africa.
\Fossil Free Penn, which launched the referendum, has called for the university to stop new investments in the fossil-fuel industry, sell off holdings in the top 200 fossil-fuel companies within five years and reinvest a portion of the funds into renewable energy.
\The group estimates that 4 percent of Penn's $9.6 billion endowment is invested in fossil-fuel companies.
\Royal Dutch Shell is a big target not only because it produces oil and gas to satisfy global demand, but also because of its record in places such as Nigeria's Niger Delta, where thieves and local insurgents frequently siphon oil from pipelines, sometimes causing leaks or explosions. Community leaders and environmental groups have accused the company of ruining the environment; the company has been selling or reducing its troubled operations onshore and sticking to those offshore.
\And in the United States, the push to drill in the Alaskan Arctic drew sharp opposition. Under Odum, ""the company consistently demonstrated a lack of preparedness and a willingness to push the limits of the law, technology and common sense,"" said Michael LeVine, a lawyer with Oceana, which opposes all offshore drilling. ""Shell's misadventures in the Arctic Ocean should serve as a cautionary tale for other oil companies considering investments in remote and dangerous places.""
\If ever the oil industry needed a human face, however, Odum has been it, representing Shell in a coalition that supported the Obama administration's cap-and-trade climate strategy back in 2009.
\At Penn, he said the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan - which would favor gas over coal - was ""not perfect, but it's a good reasonable place to start"" and he was ""supportive."" He said he would prefer an economy-wide carbon tax if it were ever politically feasible, even though it would raise retail prices of oil products.
\""I intellectually understand it,"" he said during a class in which a student asked about the divestment movement. ""If your point is to divest from fossil fuel companies, just be very clear what you want to accomplish. If it's a symbolic move - 'we want to voice our position' - I say, 'fine.' I'd much rather say there is an opportunity here, particularly with companies like Shell, to co-create a solution with a company that deeply understands energy markets.""
\Odum said, ""The idea that you can turn fossil fuels off and other sources on and all will be well in 10 years, it's just wrong.""
\He said, therefore, that ""if you're going down that route [toward divestment], then I would ask you to look at differences between companies out there. I think we're trying to do the right things.""
\Shell has long basked in a bit of climate-sensitive sunshine because of Odum's revelation (at a Washington Post event) that the company factors in a $40-a-ton carbon price when it does the economic analysis on a new project, an adjustment that would penalize proposals that are the worst from a climate change point of view. Asked about the Paris climate accord, he said ""we will never get this transition going at the pace people want without a price on carbon.""
\A Penn professor had an astute question: Does Shell assign a carbon price only to the energy the company uses to extract oil or gas? Or does it apply the price to the end use on all oil and gas found?
\Odum clarified that it applied only to the amount used in extraction - a tiny sliver of the overall climate impact of a project.
\Odum deflected a question about whether Shell should use part of its huge annual capital budget, now about $33 billion after the BG merger, to promote renewable energy. He said that shareholders of a company like Shell might prefer if Shell stuck to what it knew - finding oil and gas - and let shareholders take other money and invest it in firms specializing in renewable energy.
\Divestment is not the only hot-button issue at the University of Pennsylvania. When Odum arrived earlier in the day at the Wharton School's radio station to do an interview, the producer offered to screen out callers who were particularly irate about shale gas drilling, which has been a huge issue in Pennsylvania, where many residents say wells have contaminated drinking water.
\Odum told her not to worry. And when the subject didn't come up, he brought it up himself.
\""What's happened in the back yard here in Pennsylvania has changed the world,"" Odum said of the giant Marcellus gas reserve in the state that has lowered prices and made it possible to replace dirty burning coal-fired power plants with gas-fired ones. But he added, ""there is a right way to develop this gas"" and then there are the pollution hazards residents worry about. ""Those are not difficult problems to solve,"" he said. Shell is part of a group of companies cooperating with the Environmental Defense Fund to measure potent methane leaks that could negate climate benefits of burning gas instead of coal.
\""I come out in favor of very clear, very strong regulations,"" Odum said. ""From the perspective of a company like us, it protects us because everybody then has to do it the right way.""
\- - -
\But most of the students who saw him in a classroom, and later at an open event, zeroed in on business decisions steered by the price of oil, which has tumbled about 70 percent since July 2014. Shell has slashed capital spending to about $20 billion from about $35 billion, and it has shelved its planned Carmon Creek oil sands project in Canada. Instead of exploring for shale oil in two dozen basins, he said the company is down to six ""sweet spots.""
\""We're in a commodity business, and when you're in a down cycle, everything is difficult to decide,"" he said. ""You've got to keep your balance sheet strong. Not just to remain solvent but able to make strategic moves when everyone else is suffering.""
\When deciding on a project, he said, Shell looks at its economics, its ""resilience"" if economic conditions go bad, political factors, country risk and environmental issues. He said that before the steep price drop, Royal Dutch Shell had been weighing on six or seven big projects a year, but in the past year had signed off on only two.
\""You don't make multibillion-dollar choices lightly,"" he said, when asked about his toughest decisions.
\""I could pick an easy one: Alaska. We spent many billions of dollars exploring off Alaska,"" he said, ""but the final answer comes from the drill bit when the oil that we needed for it to be viable wasn't there.""

0,AR,"AP finds climate change risk for 327 toxic Superfund sites
",The Associated Press,"Dec 22, 2017","This year’s historic hurricane season exposed a little-known public health threat: Highly polluted sites that can be inundated by floodwaters, potentially spreading toxic contamination.
\TARPON SPRINGS, Fla. — Anthony Stansbury propped his rusty bike against a live oak tree and cast his fishing line into the rushing waters of Florida’s Anclote River.
\When he bought a house down the street last year, Stansbury says he wasn’t told that his slice of paradise had a hidden problem. The neighborhood is adjacent to the Stauffer Chemical Co. Superfund site, a former chemical manufacturing plant that is on the list of the nation’s most polluted places. That 130-acre lot on the river’s edge is also located in a flood zone.
\“Me and my kids fish here a couple times a week. Everyone who lives on this coast right here, they fish on this water daily,” said the 39-year-old father of three.
\Stansbury is among nearly 2 million people in the U.S. who live within a mile of 327 Superfund sites in areas prone to flooding or vulnerable to sea-level rise caused by climate change, according to an Associated Press analysis of flood zone maps, census data and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency records.
\This year’s historic hurricane season exposed a little-known public health threat: Highly polluted sites that can be inundated by floodwaters, potentially spreading toxic contamination.
\In Houston, more than a dozen Superfund sites were flooded by Hurricane Harvey, with breaches reported at two. In the Southeast and Puerto Rico, Superfund sites were battered by driving rains and winds from Irma and Maria.
\The vulnerable sites highlighted by AP’s review are scattered across the nation, but Florida, New Jersey and California have the most, and the most people living near them. They are in largely low-income, heavily minority neighborhoods, the data show.
\Many of the 327 sites have had at least some work done to help mitigate the threat to public health, including fencing them off and covering them in plastic sheeting to help keep out rain water.
\The Obama administration assessed some of these at-risk places and planned to gird them from harsher weather and rising seas. EPA’s 2014 Climate Adaptation Plan said prolonged flooding at low-lying Superfund sites could cause extensive erosion, carrying away contaminants as waters recede.
\President Donald Trump, however, has called climate change a hoax, and his administration has worked to remove references from federal reports and websites linking carbon emissions to the warming planet.
\“Site managers had started reviewing climate and environmental trends for each Superfund site, including the potential for flooding,” said Phyllis Anderson, who worked for 30 years as an EPA attorney and associate director of the division that manages Superfund cleanups until her retirement in 2013. “The current administration appears to be trying to erase these efforts in their climate change denials, which is a shame.”
\EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has said he intends to focus on cleaning up Superfund sites, and he appointed a task force that developed a list of sites considered the highest priority. The Stauffer site in Florida is not on it.
\Like Trump, Pruitt rejects the consensus of climate scientists that man-made carbon emissions are driving global warming. His task force’s 34-page report makes no mention of the flood risk to Superfund sites from stronger storms or rising seas, but eight of the 21 sites on EPA’s priority list are in areas of flood risk.
\Despite EPA’s announced emphasis on expediting cleanups, the Trump administration’s proposed spending plan for the current 2018 fiscal year seeks to slash Superfund program funding by nearly one-third. Congress has not yet approved new spending plans for the fiscal year, which began Oct. 1.
\Pruitt’s office declined to comment this week on the key findings of AP’s analysis or why the agency appears to no longer recognize an increasing flood risk to toxic sites posed by the changing climate.
\However, Jahan Wilcox, an EPA spokesman, said, “Despite fear-mongering from the Associated Press, not a single dollar has actually been eliminated, as Congress still hasn’t passed a budget.”
\Many flood-prone Superfund sites identified through AP’s analysis are located in low-lying, densely populated urban areas. In New Jersey, several polluted sites have more than 50,000 people living within one mile.
\In Hoboken, across the Hudson River from New York City, the site of a former manufacturing plant for mercury vapor lamps sits within a mile of almost 100,000 residents, including 7,000 children under 5.
\The Martin Aaron Inc. Superfund site is in the heart of Camden’s Waterfront South, a low-income neighborhood of crumbling row houses and industrial facilities stretching along the Delaware River.
\The 2.5-acre lot, which takes up most of a city block, has been home to a succession of factories dating back to 1886 that included a leather tannery. The air around the fenced site hangs heavy with the nose-stinging odor of solvents. Testing found that soil and groundwater under the site contained a witch’s brew of highly toxic chemicals, including PCBs and pesticides.
\Earlier this month, workers used heavy machinery to remove contaminated soil and to pump polluted water from deep underground. Long range plans approved by EPA call for eventually covering the land and restricting its future use.
\Just around the corner, Mark Skinner and his niece Cherise Skinner pushed her 1-year-old son in a stroller in front of their rented row house. Mark Skinner shrugged when asked about the work at the former industrial site.
\“It’s really contaminated, there’s a lot of stuff in the ground, but I don’t know what all it is,” said Skinner, 53, who works at a nearby scrap metal yard and has lived in Waterfront South since he was a teenager.
\Foul-smelling water filled the streets there during Superstorm Sandy in 2012, flooding many basements, long-time residents said. Census data show about 17,250 people live within a mile of the Martin Aaron site — 58 percent are black and 36 percent are Latino.
\Across the nation, more than 800,000 homes are located near flood-prone toxic sites. Houses are at risk of contamination if intense flooding brings water into them, and many more people could be affected if the contamination seeps into the ground, finding its way into drinking water.
\Mustafa Ali, who resigned in March as EPA’s senior adviser and assistant associate administrator for environmental justice, said it’s no accident that many of the nation’s most polluted sites are also located in some of the poorest neighborhoods.
\“We place the things that are most dangerous in sacrifice zones, which in many instances are communities of color where we haven’t placed as much value on their lives,” said Ali, who worked at EPA for 24 years.
\The Stauffer site in Florida is a scrubby green field along the Anclote River, ringed on its other three sides by chain-link fences with “No Trespassing” signs. Testing showed the 130-acre lot’s soils were contaminated with radium, the long-banned pesticide DDT, arsenic, lead and other pollutants that over the years have fouled the area’s groundwater and the river.
\Environmental regulators say the site now poses no threat to people or the environment because the current owner, the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, paid to treat contaminated soils, and cover the pollution with a “cap” of clean earth and grass. Still, residential development and use of groundwater on the site are prohibited because of the legacy pollution.
\Covering toxic waste is often a cheaper option than completely removing the pollutants, but the installations are not always as long-lasting as the chemicals buried beneath them, said Jeff Cunningham, a civil engineering professor at the University of South Florida.
\“As a long-term strategy, capping only works if the contaminants degrade to safe levels before the capping system eventually fails. What if it takes centuries for some of these contaminants to degrade to safe levels?” Cunningham said.
\Damage to a protective cap from storm-fueled flooding has already occurred at least once this year.
\In October, the EPA said dioxins from the San Jacinto River Waste Pits Superfund site near Houston were released after the cap was damaged by Harvey-related flooding. Tests afterward measured the toxins at 2,300 times the level that would normally trigger a new cleanup. Pruitt has since ordered an accelerated cleanup of the site.
\Seventy-six-year-old Tony Leisner has lived near Florida’s Stauffer chemical site all his life. He told the AP he is seeing damage to docks and riverside properties from the ever-rising waters in the neighborhood, and is concerned about what more flooding could mean for the Superfund lot. Although monitoring wells do test local groundwater for contamination from the site, some in Leisner’s neighborhood said they’re fearful enough to drink only bottled water.
\The Anclote River is listed as an “impaired waterway” because it fails to meet state clean water criteria, though how much of that is due to the Stauffer site’s legacy is unclear. The state has issued a warning about eating bass out of the river, but there are no signs at the popular fishing spot warning anglers even though tests show heightened levels of mercury in fish.
\Leisner said barrels of chemicals at the Stauffer site self-ignited while crews were working. He said he’s disappointed neither the company nor EPA removed the pollutants, especially since rising waters are already threatening the neighborhood.
\“Burying things rarely helps. And if you’ve got a chemical that is that toxic ... I think you need to find a way to reuse, recycle and remove (it), to a place where it’s not going to contaminate groundwater,” he said.

1,AR,"Climate change could spell disaster for coffee, but science may offer a solution.
",Caitlin Dewey - The Washington Post   ,"Oct 20, 2017","Centroamericano, a new variety of coffee plant, hasn’t sparked the buzz of, say, Starbucks’s latest novelty latte. But it may be the coolest thing in brewing: a tree that can withstand the effects of climate change.
\Climate change could spell disaster for coffee, a crop that requires specific temperatures to flourish and that is highly sensitive to a range of pests. So scientists are racing to develop more tenacious strains of one of the world’s most beloved beverages.
\In addition to Centroamericano, seven other new hybrid varieties are gradually trickling onto the market. And this summer, World Coffee Research - an industry-funded nonprofit group - kicked off field tests of 46 new varieties that it says will change coffee-growing as the world knows it.
\“Coffee is not ready to adapt to climate change without help,” said Doug Welsh, the vice president and roastmaster of Peet’s Coffee, which has invested in WCR’s research.
\Climate scientists say few coffee-growing regions will be spared the effects of climate change. Most of the world’s crop is cultivated around the equator, with the bulk coming from Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia and Ethiopia.
\Rising temperatures are expected to shrink the available growing land in many of these countries, said Christian Bunn, a postdoctoral fellow at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture who has analyzed the shift in coffee regions. Warmer air essentially “chases” coffee up to cooler, higher altitudes - which are scarce in Brazil and Zimbabwe, among other coffee-growing countries.
\Temperature is not climate change’s only projected impact in coffee-growing regions. Portions of Central America are expected to see greater rainfall and shorter dry seasons, which are needed to harvest and dry beans. In Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, rainfall is projected to decrease, potentially sparking dry periods.
\These sorts of changes will pose problems for many crops. But coffee is particularly vulnerable, scientists say, because it has an unusually shallow gene pool. Only two species of coffee, arabica and robusta, are currently grown for human consumption. And farmers traditionally haven’t selected for diversity when breeding either plant - instead, essentially, they’ve been marrying generations of coffee with its close cousins.
\As a result, there are precious few varieties of arabica that can grow in warmer or wetter conditions. In addition, diseases and pests that might be exacerbated under climate change could knock out entire fields of plants.
\A disease of particular concern - coffee leaf rust, or “la roya” in Spanish - devastated coffee plantations across Central America in 2011. It effectively halved El Salvador’s coffee output and cost the region an estimated 1.7 million jobs.
\Coffee farmers could see their livelihoods threatened, noted Aaron Davis, a British coffee researcher, because coffee trees are perennials with a 20- to 30-year life span: If a field is damaged by a bad season, farmers aren’t necessarily in a position to immediately replant it. And because coffee takes three years to mature, farmers face several years without income after new trees are planted.
\“Under all these scenarios, farmers pay the biggest price,” Davis added.
\While few experts expect these factors to drive coffee to extinction, they could severely reduce the global supply - and increase the hardship for coffee farmers.
\“The major concern of the industry is that the quantity, and even the future, of good coffee is threatened by climate change,” said Benoit Bertrand, an agronomist with the French agricultural research group CIRAD and one of the world’s most respected coffee breeders. “So the question becomes: How can we address this with new technology and new innovations?”
\Despite coffee’s global popularity, few growers have risen to the challenge. There has historically been no real market for improved coffee plants, Bertrand and Davis said: Unlike such major commodity crops as corn or soybeans, coffee is grown primarily by small farmers with low margins who can’t shell out for the latest seed or growing system.
\As a result, coffee is coming late to the intensive breeding programs that have revolutionized other crops. But in the past 10 years, interest around plant improvement has exploded, driven in part by the growth of the specialty coffee market.
\Plant breeders have begun cataloguing the hundreds of strains of arabica in existence and cultivating them in different growing areas. They’ve also begun to experiment with robusta, which grows in higher temperatures and fares better against diseases but often tastes bitter. There is some hope that new varieties of robusta, or robusta/arabica crosses, could capture that resilience without the bad flavor.
\Lately, there has been a particular surge of interest in a type of plant called an F1 hybrid, which crossbreeds two different strains of arabica to produce a unique “child” plant. They can be made from any of the hundreds of varieties of arabica and bred for qualities such as taste, disease resistance and drought tolerance.
\Because they are the first generation, F1 hybrids also demonstrate something scientists call “hybrid vigor” - they produce unusually high yields, like a sort of super plant.
\Since 2010, eight such F1 hybrids have been released to the commercial market. Bertrand is currently testing a class of an additional 60 crosses with the support of World Coffee Research.
\The researchers say that the top two or three - which are expected to become available to farmers as soon as 2022 - will offer good taste, high yields and resilience to a range of coffee’s current and future woes, from higher temperatures to nematodes.
\“These hybrids deliver a combination of traits that were never before possible in coffee,” said Hanna Neuschwander, the communications director at World Coffee Research. “It’s the traits that farmers need with the traits that markets demand. People used to think the two were mutually exclusive.”
\But the hybrids’ success remains largely untested at scale. Of the eight F1 hybrids on the market at present, only one - Centroamericano - has been planted in any significant volume, Neuschwander said. The variety is currently growing on an estimated 2,500 acres in Central America; for context, the U.S. Agriculture Department reports that Honduras alone grows coffee on more than 800,000 acres.
\Farmers who have planted the new trees are seeing success. Starbucks has sold coffee made from F1 hybrids as part of its small-lot premium brand. Last spring, a batch of Centroamericano grown on a Nicaraguan family farm scored 90 out of 100 points in that country’s prestigious tasting competition, which some in the industry heralded as a major victory.
\But the path to adoption will be steep. Breeders have developed these plants, Neuschwander said, but many areas of the world don’t have the seed industries and infrastructure in place to actually distribute them. That’s particularly true in the case of F1 hybrids, which - thanks to their particular genetics - can only be grown from tissue samples.
\F1 hybrids are also expensive - as much as 21/2 times the cost of conventional plants. That puts them well outside the range of most smallholder farmers, said Kraig Kraft, an agroecologist and technical adviser with Catholic Relief Services’ Latin America division.
\Kraft, who has worked with World Coffee Research to test F1 hybrids in Nicaragua, said that in his region, at least, only midsize and large plantations have switched to them.
\“I think our position is that we need to really understand the requirements for all farmers to be able to use these new technologies,” Kraft said. “My concern is that small farmers don’t have access to the capital to pay for these investments.”
\Even if they did, however, some experts caution that the new coffee varieties are only a piece of a much larger adaptation process. To cope with the effects of climate change, farmers may need to adopt other agricultural practices, such as shade-farming, cover-cropping and terracing, said Bunn, the researcher.
\In some regions, those practices won’t be economical. And in that case, policymakers should focus on helping farmers transition to other crops or other livelihoods altogether, researchers stress.
\“People sell [F1 hybrids] as a silver bullet,” Bunn said. “To be clear, those plants are indispensable, and I don’t question the value of the work . . . but we need more to adapt to climate change. And we need to accept the hard reality that some places will need to move out of coffee production.”

2,AR,"From cloud nine to climate change, here’s why you should always look up
",Amy Ellis Nutt - The Washington Post   ,"Oct 9, 2017","The sky has brought nothing but trouble lately - hurricanes, tornadoes, torrential rain. For good reason, people look up with wary eyes. On ordinary days, a pleasant wisp of white or a menacing thunderhead serve a more pedestrian preoccupation, a pragmatic barometer for how to dress or where to go.
\Then there are those who gaze skyward for contemplation, even inspiration - especially when that azure canopy is tinted by white.
\Whether they’re streaking from horizon to horizon or floating in whiffs and puffs, clouds play large in our lives. They saturate our speech: Think of cloud nine. Our songs: Cue Joni Mitchell. Our literature, our art, even our geology is filled with clouds. What are some of the highest mountains in Colorado named? Mount Nimbus, Stratus, Cirrus & Cumulus.
\As Yeats wrote, “I know that I shall meet my fate somewhere among the clouds above.”
\For climatologists, though, clouds are scientifically important as well as deeply challenging.
\“Clouds are hard to model,” NASA associate research scientist Kate Marvel said. “They’re the result of water vapor or ice crystals coalescing around microscopic bits of dust, particles of smoke and sea salt. . . . So they have a dual effect on climate. They trap the heat from the planet and spit it back down, making things warmer, but they also block sunlight, which is a cooling effect.”
\All of which frustrates climatologists trying to understand the effect of clouds on the planet.
\“Even small changes to the distribution of clouds with rising temperatures could substantially diminish or enhance global warming,” said David Romps, a professor of Earth and planetary science at the University of California at Berkeley.
\In July 2016, the journal Nature published research showing cloud cover had increased over Earth’s polar regions, accelerating greenhouse gas concentrations.
\“Right now, clouds are more air conditioner than heater,” Romps noted, “but that will change as the planet warms.”
\Some scientists have even theorized certain distinctive cloud formations can be harbingers of imminent earthquakes. A Chinese engineer claims to have successfully predicted more than 30 temblors.
\Psychologically speaking, clouds also have both positive and negative impact. Overcast weather turns us inward and helps us focus, the experts say. Sunny weather, by contrast, slows cognition.
\Researchers in Australia tested their theory with an experiment several years ago. They showed - for the first time in a real-life setting - weather-induced moods can significantly affect memory. On rainy, cloudy days, which caused a gloomy mood, the ability to recall objects was three times greater than on sunny days, despite all the positive vibes they triggered.
\To artists and writers, clouds have been everything from eye-catching backdrops in paintings to humorous metaphors in literature - even objects of philosophical inquiry. Where would religion be without clouds? The Bible’s many references start at the very beginning with Genesis 9:13. (“I have set my rainbow in the clouds,” God says, “and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the Earth.”)
\When 17th century French thinker Rene Descartes wasn’t busy becoming the father of modern philosophy (“I think, therefore I am,”) he was looking up at the sky and musing confidently on his scientific acumen.
\“We imagine [clouds] so lofty that even the poets and painters depict them as the throne of God,” he wrote. “This makes me hope that if I explain their nature . . . one will easily believe that it is possible in the same way to find the causes of everything wonderful on the Earth.”
\More than 400 years later, Dutch visual artist Berndnaut Smilde creates his own fleeting clouds indoors. He uses a complicated mix of smoke and water vapor, then captures the results on photographs before the clouds disintegrate back into nothingness.
\Smilde has conjured clouds in a Turkish bath in Istanbul, at a deserted mining company in Belgium, even in a centuries-old London dungeon.
\“You need a certain space and want it to float,” he explained. “The search for the ideal cloud can take a long time.”
\Clouds have often come with numbers attached, the most prevalent being cloud nine. It played a starring role in The Temptations’ 1968 album of the same name, with its eponymous Grammy-winning song. It then resurfaced 19 years later as an album title for former Beatle George Harrison.
\The phrase, indicating a state of euphoria, may have originated from the early cloud classification system in which cloud nine was the tallest formation. Then again, cloud seven carried you into bliss, according to the 1960 American Dictionary of Slang. You definitely didn’t want to end up on cloud eight - it meant you were drunk, per a 1930s book about the criminal “underworld.”
\Gavin Pretor-Pinney sees cloud-watching as a leisure activity. On a lark in 2005, the Londoner founded the Cloud Appreciation Society. Its membership today tops 43,500 with “cloudspotters” ringing the globe from the Congo to Canada, Iceland to Iran, China to Chile. The United Kingdom is home to more than half the organization’s members. The United States is second with nearly 10,000.
\Many regularly send their best cloud photos to Pretor-Pinney, who uses them for his “cloud of the day” and “cloud of the month” emails. In fact, interest has grown so much that the Cloud Appreciation Society is now a full-time business. Pretor-Pinney, an art designer by training, is leading “sky holidays” to particularly cloudy parts of the world. The first trip was to Canada in February to see the Northern Lights.
\“I’ve always felt the sky to be the most dynamic, most poetic part of nature,” Pretor-Pinney said. “So it’s always struck me as a shame that it’s gotten bad press.”
\The society even helped identify a new class of cloud, a turbulent formation named asperitas that was officially added this March to the 121-year-old International Cloud Atlas.
\The group, of course, has nothing good to say about lovers of cloudlessness - including beachgoers, most prominently. They call the worship of monotonous cloudlessness “blue sky thinking.”
\Pretor-Pinney rejects such a limited view of the heavens. “Cloudspotting is a conscious invitation to daydream, a sensitivity to your surroundings,” he said. “It’s a kind of sky geekiness, which is beautiful.”

","Channon Phipps, Mulberry","Sep 28, 2017","Here we go again, after Harvey (Robert McAfee, Community Matters, Sunday, Sept 10) with the obligatory climatology chant (repeat after me): Mankind is responsible for: (70s-80s “Global Cooling”), (80s-90s “Global Warming”) and of course 2000s-Present “Climate Change” (so no matter what it does, it’s covered). Despite the fact the Earth has gone through cyclical warming and cooling cycles throughout its history, and that it’s a naturally occurring, repetitive cycle — somehow THIS TIME mankind is doing it.
\No matter that volcanic eruptions like Tambora in 1815 was the equivalent of 2.2 million nuclear bombs like those dropped on Japan and it released 60 Tg (teragram, or 10-12 grams) sulfur, 100 Tg chlorine (as HCl) and 70 Tg fluorine (that’s ~262,000 Saturn V rockets of sulfur and fluorine and 437,000 of chlorine) into earth’s atmosphere, all in a few days. Far more than humans could do on purpose, and yet strangely enough, even all that didn’t destroy the environment and if you employ evolutionary timescales (billions of years) the Earth fully recovered from it all in less than a millionth of the blink of an eye.
\Add all the other volcanic eruptions in history to that, and mankind cannot compete with the destructive powers of nature in its wildest dreams. Despite what the Chicken Little Climatologists would like us to believe, man-made ”*climate change” (*we know it as “weather”) is NOT “settled science.” Isn’t it odd that climatologists who get paid to preach man-made climate change do so, and (the majority) of those not getting grants or being paid to preach it do not?

",NA,"Jan 22, 2015","WASHINGTON — U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., the most vocal opponent in Congress of proposals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, supported an amendment Wednesday declaring climate change is real and not a hoax.
\Inhofe, who wrote a book in 2012 called “The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future,” voted minutes later against a separate amendment linking climate change to human activity.
\The votes came amid Senate consideration of a bill requiring construction of the Keystone XL pipeline to carry tar sands crude from western Canada to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico.
\Inhofe pulled a surprise move when, just before the vote, he announced he was co-sponsoring a one-sentence amendment by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse: “It is the sense of the Senate that climate change is real and not a hoax.”
\Inhofe told his colleagues, “Climate is changing. Climate has always changed and always will. There is archaeological evidence of that, there is biblical evidence of that, there is historical evidence of that. It will always change.
\“The hoax is that there are some people who are so arrogant to think they are so powerful they can change climate. Man can’t change climate.”

6,AR,"What climate change has to do with the price of your lettuce
",Caitlin Dewey - The Washington Post,"May 12, 2017","   
\Unusual weather in the Southwest could cause a nationwide salad shortage later this month. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg (lettuce): Scientists say the weird weather is probably caused by climate change - which means these sorts of problems are likely to happen again.
\The shortage, first reported by NPR, is the result of two separate phenomena in Arizona’s Yuma County and California’s Salinas Valley, the two places where the United States grows most of its leafy greens. In Yuma, the lettuce harvest, which usually runs from November to April, wound up early because of unusually warm weather. And in central California, which typically picks up the harvest once Yuma is done, heavy precipitation delayed some plantings.
\That could cause a gap at some point between lettuce supplies, said George Frisvold, an agricultural economist at the University of Arizona. Frisvold’s colleague, Jonathan Overpeck, the director of the university’s Institute of the Environment, says we can blame ourselves, in part, for the great salad shortage.
\“There’s this old adage in climate science that you can’t attribute any one event to human causes,” Overpeck said. “That’s not really true anymore, because now it’s really been established that humans alter the whole global climate system. Anything related to increased warmth in the atmosphere likely has some element of human causation.”
\Both the temperature in Yuma and the rain in Salinas have a link to atmospheric warmth. The case of Yuma is pretty obvious: Temperatures in the Southwest have been increasing for 100 years, and this winter was no different. According to the National Weather Service, February’s average temperature was two degrees warmer than the recorded average in recent decades.
\In Salinas, the situation is a bit more complex, Overpeck said. The region has seen an unusual number of storms called “atmospheric rivers” -- you might know them by the name Pineapple Express - which push heavy precipitation to the Pacific coast from around the Hawaiian islands. It’s unclear whether climate change has a role in the increased incidence of atmospheric rivers, Overpeck said. While some early research suggests that is the case, more data is needed to confirm it.
\That said, it’s “a basic concept of physics” that when the atmosphere is warmer, it holds more moisture, Overpeck explained. That means that, when storm clouds form, you tend to see more snow and rain.
\According to the 2012 Census of Agriculture, Yuma County boasts nearly 70,000 acres of planted lettuce, while Monterey County, the home of the Salinas Valley, has 134,000. The 2015 Salinas harvest was valued at more than $1.65 billion.
\Both regions primarily grow iceberg and leaf lettuce, followed by spinach and baby greens.
\Incidentally, these sorts of cascading disruptions aren’t just limited to lettuce - or even to the United States. Britain recently suffered a widely publicized shortage of iceberg lettuce, zucchini, broccoli and cabbage, brought on by extreme weather in Europe’s “salad bowl,” Spain.
\Closer to home, fruit growers across the Northeast and Midwest have expressed concern that unusually high and fluctuating temperatures could cause crops like apples, cherries, plums and grapes to develop too early and expose them to spring freezes. The Progressive Farmer recently warned that “almost off the charts” temperatures in Kansas and Oklahoma could put early-growing winter wheat at similar risk, plus expose it to warm-weather pests and diseases.
\In 2012, high winter temperatures cost Michigan $220 million in cherry harvests. That same year, unusually hot nighttime temperatures also cut into Corn Belt yields.
\The National Climate Assessment estimated that California and Arizona will have gained 70 extra hot nights per year and 12 to 15 additional consecutive days without rain by the end of the century, because of warming.
\“Climate change impacts on agriculture,” the report concludes, “will have consequences for food security both in the U.S. and globally.”
\Compared with that dire prediction, of course, a few weeks without lettuce probably doesn’t sound so bad. Frisvold cautions that any price spikes resulting from a shortage would probably be short term and that none have materialized just yet.
\But in the sense that the looming salad scenario signals things to come, it’s worth paying attention.
\“Every grower is noting warming,” Overpeck said. “And while we can’t say what percentage is due to humans, we can say humans are putting their foot on the accelerator.”

7,AR,"Letter: U.S. must lead on climate change
","John Ward, Greenwood","Jan 20, 2017   ","Those evangelicals who prayed for the election of President-Elect Donald Trump and now declare his victory to be God’s answer to their prayers should now begin praying Trump was correct when he called climate change a hoax invented by the Chinese.
\Trump wants to exit the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. America’s leadership in this agreement is crucial for other nations maintaining their commitments to CO2 emission reduction. He wants to increase the usage of heavy CO2-producing oil and coal. He wants to roll back President Obama’s Clean Power Plan with its steps to reduce carbon emissions 26 to 28 percent by 2025. Trump has picked Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, an oil industry shill, to head the Environmental Protection Agency.
\Some very reliable research indicates the Earth is racing toward an apocalyptic future because of climate change if CO2 emissions are not dramatically reduced. According to a University of Hawaii study, major cities such as New York and London could become uninhabitable because of irreversible man-made climate change. Humanitarian crises could unfold as hundreds of millions of refugees pour illegally across borders fleeing regions increasingly incapable of sustaining life. The study has concluded these things could occur within 45 years. This means the children and grandchildren of the 81 percent of white evangelicals who voted for Donald Trump will watch these catastrophes unfold.
\Those evangelicals declaring the election of Donald Trump to be the answer to their prayers have made a huge bet: They have essentially wagered the Christian faith of their descendants on these claims. Their children and grandchildren could very well see these declarations as an argument for atheism.

8,AR,"In break with Trump, EPA pick Pruitt says climate change isn’t hoax
","MICHAEL BIESECKER and MATTHEW DALY, Associated Press","Jan 18, 2017","WASHINGTON — Donald Trump’s choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that climate change is real, breaking with both the president-elect and his own past statements.
\In response to questions from Democrats during his Senate confirmation hearing, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt said he disagreed with Trump’s earlier claims that global warming is a hoax created by the Chinese to harm the economic competitiveness of the United States.
\“I do not believe climate change is a hoax,” Pruitt said.
\The 48-year-old Republican has previously cast doubt on the extensive body of scientific evidence showing that the planet is warming and man-made carbon emissions are to blame. In a 2016 opinion article, Pruitt suggested that the debate over global warming “is far from settled” and he claimed that “scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.”
\At the hearing before the Senate Energy and Public Works Committee, Pruitt conceded that human activity contributes “in some manner” to climate change. He continued, however, to question whether the burning of fossil fuels is the primary reason, and refused to say whether sea levels are rising.
\Pruitt’s testimony came shortly after NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a joint statement affirming that 2016 was officially the hottest year in recorded history. Studies show the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass, while the world’s oceans have risen on average nearly 7 inches in the last century.
\Pressed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to answer in detail about his beliefs about climate change, Pruitt responded that his personal opinion was “immaterial” to how he would enforce environmental laws.
\In his current post, Pruitt joined a multistate lawsuit opposing the Obama administration’s plan to limit planet-warming carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. Pruitt also sued over the EPA’s recent expansion of water bodies regulated under the Clean Water Act. It has been opposed by industries that would be forced to clean up polluted wastewater.
\Pruitt said that if were confirmed by the GOP-run Senate, he would work with states and industry to return the federal watchdog to what he described as its proper role.
\“Environmental regulations should not occur in an economic vacuum,” Pruitt said. “We can simultaneously pursue the mutual goals of environmental protection and economic growth.”
\Pruitt has a history of criticizing and suing the agency he is in line to lead. Environmentalists opposing his nomination cite his cozy relationships with oil and gas industry executives who have donated to his political campaigns.
\As the hearing got underway, shouting could be heard from people who were not allowed in. The room accommodated fewer than 100 people; most seats were taken by congressional staff, reporters and others who were allowed in early. Only a few seats remained for the public.
\One woman was quickly wrestled out of the room by three police officers as she pulled out a roll of yellow crime scene tape and shouted “We don’t want EPA gutted!”
\Later, a group of coal miners wearing hard hats were allowed in to show support for Pruitt. Trump has pledged to bring back tens of thousands of lost coal mining jobs once inaugurated, though he has not yet detailed how.
\Senate Republicans uniformly praised Pruitt what they described as his robust record of enforcing environmental laws “when appropriate.” Court records show scant evidence of Pruitt acting to protect the environment in years as a state regulator.
\Shortly after Pruitt took office in Oklahoma in 2011, he disbanded the unit responsible for protecting the state’s natural resources. He reassigned his staff to file more than a dozen lawsuits challenging EPA regulations.
\Senate Democrats focused on Pruitt’s record of siding with polluters in court as he collected campaign contributions from them.
\Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., pressed Pruitt on money he raised from energy companies such as Exxon Mobil and Devon Energy, as well as the corporate “dark money” raised by groups with which he is involved that are not required to disclose their donors.
\Earlier this month, Pruitt resigned from the board of the Rule of Law Defense Fund, a Washington-based group supporting the legal agendas of GOP attorney generals that Whitehouse described the group as “a complete black hole into which at least $1 million goes.” In his response, Pruitt declined to disclose whether the group’s donors included fossil fuel companies or utilities with regulatory issues before EPA.
\Though Pruitt ran unopposed for a second term in 2014, public campaign finance reports show he raised more than $700,000, much of it from people in the energy and utility industries.
\Pruitt has also faced criticism from environmentalists for failing to take any action to help curb a dramatic spike in earthquake activity in Oklahoma that scientists have linked to the underground disposal of oil and gas wastewater.
\Pruitt said his support for legal positions advocated by oil and gas companies was in the best interest of Oklahoma, which is economically dependent on the fossil fuel industry.

9,AR,"Sen. Inhofe, Denier Of Human Role In Climate Change, Likely To Lead Environment Committee
",NA,"Nov 6, 2014","WASHINGTON — Sen. James M. Inhofe, an the Oklahoma Republican who once compared the Environmental Protection Agency to the gestapo, is likely to lead the Environment and Public Works Committee when the GOP takes control of the Senate next year.
\If approved, Inhofe would replace Chairman Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., an avowed environmentalist, producing one of the most stark post-election changes in the Capitol. Committee assignments will not be made until Senate party caucuses meet in Washington after the election recess.
\Inhofe, who has served in the Senate for two decades, is an iconic figure to both environmental and energy lobbyists. He chaired the committee from 2003 to 2008, when Republicans controlled the Senate. Inhofe, a former congressman and mayor of Tulsa, came to Washington to do battle with federal bureaucrats, particularly those at the EPA whom he said threatened the energy industry in his home state.
\In his 2012 book, “The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future,” Inhofe describes himself as a lonely crusader against an environmental-liberal conspiracy. “First I stood alone in saying that anthropogenic [manmade] catastrophic global warming is a hoax,” he wrote.
\Shortly after becoming chairman of the committee in 2003, Inhofe took issue with the theory that increasing carbon dioxide emissions causes catastrophic disasters. “Actually,” he said, “global warming can be beneficial to mankind,” leading to improvements in the environment and the economy.
\The book lays out his belief that the EPA needed to be constrained. Its regulations, he wrote, have long threatened the U.S. economy, a situation that has only grown more severe in recent years, as the Obama administration and its allies on the left perpetuate the myth of manmade climate change — and propose an executive branch initiative to address the problem.
\“The Obama EPA is set to implement the most aggressive regulatory regime in history,” he wrote, criticizing the agency’s plan to regulate carbon emissions. “Global warming alarmists,” he wrote, “are set to destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs and significantly raise energy prices for families, businesses and farmers, basically anyone who drives a car, uses heavy machinery, or flips a switch.
\Many Republicans, including the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, share his skepticism of the EPA and its plan to address carbon emissions, which became apparent in 2009. That year, the agency issued a finding that greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming endanger the public’s health and welfare. Subsequently, the agency told industrial facilities — such as power plants and oil refineries that require permits to emit sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide — to account for greenhouse gas emissions if they expand or add construction that significantly increases greenhouse gas pollution.
\Republican lawmakers, with energy sector allies, argued that the rules would damage U.S. manufacturers’ ability to compete against companies operating in countries with less stringent standards.
\Inhofe was among the most aggressive of the critics, warning that the U.S. economy would be placed at risk.
\In addition to attacking the EPA regulatory scheme, he has been among the most outspoken critics of climate scientists, calling attention in 2010 to the disclosure of emails and documents at the Climate Research Unit at Britain’s East Anglia University that discussed the alleged twisting of some data and conclusions.
\Inhofe has called for congressional action to limit EPA regulations on clean water, saying the agency exceeded its authority and tramples on the rights of states.
\His reelection, and the arrival of several new Republicans, will increase the number of Senate critics of environmental regulation, including those who have been urging approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. For example, in Colorado, Republican Rep. Cory Gardner defeated Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, who had voted against the project.
\Scott Segal, an energy lobbyist at Bracewell & Giuliani law firm in Washington, said of the potential committee assignment: “While activists are not happy about it, they have to admit that Senator Inhofe ran a fair committee with open hearings and respect for minority viewpoints... . Inhofe will put the administration through its paces. But he will do it with respect.”

10,AR,"Robinson: Trump will be in for climate change fight
",Eugene Robinson/Washington Post   ,"Dec 16, 2016","WASHINGTON -- The incoming Trump administration will face passionate and hostile resistance if it tries to deny the reality of human-induced climate change. We can already hear the drums of war.
\-- The Department of Energy flatly denied a demand from the Trump transition team to supply the names of employees or contractors who have participated in international climate change negotiations in the last five years. Also rejected was a request for names of staff who helped calculate the “social cost” of carbon emissions. The obvious concern is that these workers would be labeled as unreliable, and perhaps shoved aside, by political appointees determined to pretend that climate change does not exist.
\-- Scientists have begun a frantic effort to archive decades’ worth of climate data, copying it onto servers that are beyond the U.S. government’s reach. The voluminous data sets, compiled by agencies including NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, help form the basis for the consensus view that the atmosphere and the oceans are rapidly warming due to heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions. There has been no threat from the Trump camp to do anything untoward regarding the data, but the researchers are taking no chances.
\-- California Gov. Jerry Brown said Wednesday that if President-elect Donald Trump tries to impede his state’s vigorous efforts against climate change, “We’ve got the scientists, we’ve got the lawyers and we’re ready to fight. We’re ready to defend.” Speaking in San Francisco at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union, Brown warned that rumored budget cuts might end a NASA program that uses satellites to take measurements of the earth, including temperature. “If Trump turns off the satellites,” Brown declared, “California will launch its own damn satellite.”
\All of this is just the beginning. Trump, who has repeatedly described climate change as a “hoax,” will try to reverse the Obama administration’s progress in limiting carbon emissions. Assuming he follows through, he’ll have a real fight on his hands.
\At one of his strongman-style victory rallies this past Tuesday night, Trump said that “we will cancel the restrictions on the production of American energy, including shale, oil, natural gas, and clean, beautiful coal.”
\Apparently, Trump never met a fossil fuel he didn’t like. And he has announced his intention to appoint the most prominent oil man he could find -- Rex Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon Mobil, the largest non-government oil company in the world -- as secretary of state.
\Trump may renounce the historic Paris agreement, in which the world’s biggest carbon emitters -- China, the United States and India -- all pledged curbs. He can also eliminate regulations limiting carbon emissions by power plants; encourage more drilling for oil and natural gas; and try his best to revive the moribund coal mining industry, though its decline is due more to market forces than to anything the government has done.
\These threatened actions come near the end of what will almost surely be the warmest year on record. Continuing what scientists see as an indisputable trend, 2016 was an absolute scorcher. And yes, I realize that right now it’s cold outside in much of the country; some scientists believe that rapid warming at the North Pole has destabilized air flow patterns and perhaps made these “polar vortex” cold snaps more common. In any event, the key measurement is the global temperature average, not the local wind chill.
\Trump is being advised by a number of vocal climate-change deniers. The data that scientists are rushing to preserve clearly refutes those who say there is no warming -- hence the urgency to protect the information. Some deniers acknowledge the fact of warming but say it is due to some unfathomable natural cycle. But Occam’s razor argues persuasively for the simpler explanation: Since the Industrial Revolution, we have increased the atmosphere’s concentration of carbon dioxide -- known to trap heat -- by an incredible 40 percent.
\Much of the rest of the world understands the need to move toward clean energy. The technology isn’t quite there yet, so some breakthroughs will be required. Smart government policy would be to invest in research to make it more likely that these advances are made in Berkeley rather than Bangalore or Beijing.
\Dumb policy would be to fire up the smokestacks, stop collecting all that annoying climate data and marginalize federal employees who best understand global warming. This is the direction Trump appears to be headed.
\The president-elect threatens to make the United States a second-rate player in the coming clean-energy economy. I guess that’s his idea of greatness, but it’s not mine.

11,AR,"Energy Department rejects Trump request for climate-change names
","Posted Dec 13, 2016 at 2:06 PM",By Todd Shields and Jennifer A. Dlouhy / Bloomberg News,"   
\WASHINGTON — The U.S. Energy Department rejected a request from President-elect Donald J. Trump’s transition team for the names of workers who played a role in implementing President Barack Obama’s climate agenda.
\“We are going to respect the professional and scientific integrity and independence of our employees,” Energy Department spokesman Eben Burnham-Snyder said in an email Tuesday. “We will not be providing any individual names to the transition team.”
\The transition team asked the agency to list employees and contractors who attended United Nations climate meetings, along with those who helped develop methods to estimate and justify the benefits of new rules, according to an internal document obtained by Bloomberg News.
\Trump has questioned the science of climate change, and named to his transition team a number of people who either deny that man-made global warming is happening or are skeptical of the link between the burning of fossil fuels and the climate. Democrats and outside advocacy groups said the questions were an attempt to intimidate workers.
\“Some of the questions asked left many in our workforce unsettled,” Burnham-Snyder said. The department would provide “publicly available information.”
\Under Obama, the Energy Department played a major role advancing clean-energy technology through loan guarantees and incubators, while writing efficiency rules for appliances. The department leans heavily on tens of thousands of contractors, who supplement the work of its roughly 13,000 direct employees.
\“It’s great that the Department of Energy is taking the independence of its employees seriously and will do what it can to protect their ability to do their jobs,” said Michael Halpern, deputy director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
\Thomas Pyle, who leads the energy-focused transition team for Trump, didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
\Trump has chosen Rick Perry, a former Texas governor, to lead the agency, according to four people familiar with the president-elect’s selection process. Perry, a former presidential candidate, once vowed to abolish the department but forgot its name during a debate. He’s at least the third Cabinet pick considered friendly to the oil industry.

12,AR,"John Kerry talks climate change but not Trump in Antarctica
",The Associated Press,"Nov 11, 2016","MCMURDO STATION, Antarctica — U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry didn’t comment on President-elect Donald Trump’s election victory on Friday while visiting Antarctica, but did say that citizens who care about limiting emissions might have to march in the streets to push for more aggressive action.
\Kerry became the highest-ranking American official to visit Antarctica when he landed for a two-day trip. He’s been hearing from scientists about the impact of climate change on the frozen continent.
\Trump has called climate change a hoax and said he would “cancel” U.S. involvement in the landmark Paris Agreement on global warming.
\“We need to get more of a movement going,” Kerry said when addressing several hundred scientists and staff at an evening event at McMurdo Station, the large base which is the hub for U.S. operations. “We need to get more people to engage.”
\Kerry said there was a risk that much of Antarctica’s ice will eventually flow into the ocean, raising sea levels worldwide.
\Despite the Paris agreement to cut the fossil-fuel emissions causing the planet to warm, “we haven’t won the battle yet,” Kerry said to the audience that included many young people involved in climate research.
\Earlier, a planned visit to the South Pole was scrapped because of bad weather. Instead, Kerry and members of his entourage were taken on a helicopter tour of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, one of the few parts of Antarctica that are largely free of ice year-round.
\Kerry left from New Zealand early Friday aboard a C-17 Globemaster military cargo plane after being held up for about a day by bad weather. An experienced pilot, Kerry spent much of the flight in the cockpit of the huge jet, chatting with the pilots.
\After a smooth trip of about five hours, the group landed on the Pegasus Ice Runway, the strip of ice that serves McMurdo.
\Kerry’s aides described the trip as a learning opportunity for the secretary of state. He has been receiving briefings from scientists working to understand the effects of climate change on Antarctica.
\Kerry has made climate change an intensive focus of American diplomacy during his term, and had previously spent decades working on the issue as a U.S. senator.
\He planned to return to New Zealand on Saturday for a meeting with Prime Minister John Key. Kerry plans to fly next week to the Middle East for talks, and then onward to a global climate conference in Morocco, where he will give a major speech.

13,AR,"Paris climate change deal becomes international law
",Michael Astor / The Associated Press,"Nov 4, 2016  ","UNITED NATIONS — The Paris Agreement to combat climate change became international law on Friday — a landmark deal about tackling global warming amid growing fears that the world is becoming hotter even faster than scientists expected.
\So far, 96 countries, accounting for just over two-thirds of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, have formally joined the accord, which seeks to limit global warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. More countries are expected to come aboard in the coming weeks and months.
\Secretary General Ban-Ki moon commemorated the event, talking with civil society groups at U.N. headquarters in New York to hear their concerns and visions for the future.
\“Today we make history in humankind’s efforts to combat climate change,” Ban said before opening the meeting.
\He praised the civil groups for mobilizing hundreds of millions of people to back fighting climate change, but warned the outcome remained uncertain.
\“We are still in a race against time. We need to transition to a low-emissions and climate-resilient future,” Ban said. “Now is the time to strengthen global resolve, do what science demands and seize the opportunity to build a safer more sustainable world for all.”
\Scientists praised the speed at which the agreement, signed by over 190 parties last December in Paris, has come into force, saying it underscores a new commitment by the international community to address the problem which is melting polar ice caps, sending sea levels rising and transforming vast swaths of arable land into desert.
\But environmentalists say the agreement is just the first step of a much longer and complicated process of transitioning away from fossil fuels, which currently supply the bulk of the planet’s energy needs and also are the primary drivers of global warming.
\Naomi Ages, climate liability project lead at Greenpeace, said that it was up to civil society groups to hold governments and corporations responsible.
\“We know that existing fossil fuel projects will push us past 2 degrees, so we’re mobilizing around the world to keep it in the ground and stop development of new fossil fuel projects,” Ages said.
\While the Paris agreement is legally binding, the emissions reductions that each country has committed to are not. Instead, the agreement seeks to create a transparent system that will allow the public to monitor how well each country is doing in meeting its goals in hopes that this will motivate them to transition more quickly to clean, renewable energy like wind, solar and hydropower.
\The agreement also requires governments to develop climate action plans that will be periodically revised and replaced with new, even more ambitious, plans. Many of these details will begin to be addressed at the COP22 climate change meeting that begins next week in Marrakech, Morocco.

14,AR,"Google Cuts Ties With Conservative Group Over Climate-Change Stance
",NA,"Sep 24, 2014","WASHINGTON — Google’s effort to build strong alliances with Republican politicians and conservative advocacy groups is paying dividends on Capitol Hill, but has created a growing marketing and public relations headache for the firm.
\Climate-change activists have shown up at shareholder meetings demanding that executives explain how the firm can, in good conscience, support lawmakers who deny that global warming is a threat.
\A fundraiser that the company held for Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., one of the most vocal climate-change skeptics in Congress, touched off a mini-rebellion among staff, along with unwelcome media attention.
\And the Sierra Club and major unions, including the SEIU and the AFL-CIO, joined 50 other groups this month in demanding that Google end its membership in the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative network of state politicians that, among other projects, works to roll back laws that promote solar and wind power.
\Google bowed to that demand Monday, announcing that it would sever ties with ALEC because of the group’s stand on climate change.
\“The consensus within the company was that that was some sort of mistake,” Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said of the decision to join the group.
\“Everyone understands climate change is occurring, and the people who oppose it are really hurting our children and our grandchildren and making the world a much worse place. And so we should not be aligned with such people — they’re just, they’re just literally lying,” Schmidt said in an interview with NPR’s Diane Rehm on Monday.
\Environmental activists praised the decision but said they would continue to press Google to change other aspects of its political strategy.
\The company is “going in the right direction” by abandoning ALEC, “but it is still funding the campaigns of climate deniers in Congress and on K Street,” said Brant Olson, campaign director for Forecast the Facts, an activist group that had played a major role in organizing the anti-ALEC campaign. “It is still shooting itself in the foot in terms of its climate goals.”
\Lisa Nelson, ALEC’s chief executive, attributed Google’s move to “public pressure from left-leaning individuals and organizations who intentionally confuse free-market policy perspectives for climate-change denial.”
\Microsoft, which had come under similar pressure, recently abandoned its ALEC membership.
\Like other firms in the tech industry, Google in recent years has become more active in trying to lobby Washington. At a time when the GOP controls the House and may soon control the Senate, the firm is looking to build as many relationships as possible with prominent conservatives.
\But playing both sides of the street and hedging political bets fit badly with the Mountain View, Calif., company’s carefully honed public image. Google has increasingly found it hard to reconcile its progressive Bay Area corporate persona with hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to people and causes the progressive base detests.
\Google’s politics are complicated. The company receives accolades from green activists for $1.5 billion it has invested in clean-energy technology. It bankrolls some of the most ambitious solar projects on the planet. The company’s passions for creativity, innovation and free expression play well with liberals.
\But the tech behemoth’s agenda in Washington is broad. Many of the issues on which it lobbies, including patent reform, digital privacy and net neutrality, do not fall neatly along partisan lines. As Google cultivates Republican allies on such issues, the progressive blowback intensifies.
\“We should not be electing climate deniers into office, and we should not be supporting them in the marketplace,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club.
\“Et tu Google?” was a headline on a report published this month by Forecast the Facts and the Sum of Us, two networks of liberal activists that boast a combined membership of more than 5.2 million.
\The groups challenged Google’s nearly $700,000 in cumulative corporate and employee donations to lawmakers who have publicly doubted the threat of climate change.
\The list of climate skeptics was compiled by another liberal advocacy group, the Washington-based Center for American Progress, which has close ties to the Obama administration. The center, ironically, gets funding from Google.
\The latest pressure came after 17 of Google’s own science fellows, outraged by the Inhofe fundraiser, questioned the company’s moral leadership in a letter last year to its top executives.
\Anger over the ALEC ties had prompted several activists to journey to Google’s shareholder meeting in May, including Jim Wilke, owner of a rooftop solar business in Oklahoma. He says ALEC-inspired legislation passed in his state is undermining the rooftop solar industry there.
\“You continue to fund a group that is actively and successfully destroying renewable-energy markets,” he said at the meeting.
\David Drummond, Google’s chief legal officer, thanked Wilke for raising the issue, noting that he was not the first to do so.
\“We’ll continue to review it,” Drummond said at the time.

15,AR,"Reports: Climate change ‘significant and direct’ threat to U.S. military
",Idrees Ali / Reuters   ,"Sep 14, 2016","WASHINGTON — The effects of climate change endanger U.S. military operations and could increase the danger of international conflict, according to three new documents endorsed by retired top U.S. military officers and former national security officials.
\“There are few easy answers, but one thing is clear: the current trajectory of climatic change presents a strategically-significant risk to U.S. national security, and inaction is not a viable option,” said a statement published on Wednesday by the Center for Climate and Security, a Washington-based think tank.
\It was signed by more than a dozen former senior military and national security officials, including retired General Anthony Zinni, former commander of the U.S. Central Command, and retired Admiral Samuel Locklear, head of the Pacific Command until last year.
\They called on the next U.S. president to create a cabinet level position to deal with climate change and its impact on national security.
\A separate report by a panel of retired military officials, also published on Wednesday by the Center for Climate and Security, said more frequent extreme weather is a threat to U.S. coastal military installations.
\“The complex relationship between sea level rise, storm surge and global readiness and responsiveness must be explored down to the operational level, across the Services and Joint forces, and up to a strategic level as well,” the report said.
\Earlier this year, another report said faster sea level rises in the second half of this century could make tidal flooding a daily occurrence for some installations.
\Francesco Femia, co-founder and president of the Center for Climate and Security, said the reports show bipartisan national security and military officials think the existing U.S. response to climate change “is not commensurate to the threat”.
\The fact that a large and bipartisan number of former officials signed the reports could increase pressure on future U.S. administrations to place greater emphasis and dedicate more resources to combat climate change.
\Addressing climate change has not been a top priority in a 2016 campaign dominated by the U.S. economy, trade and foreign policy.
\Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has said that global warming is a concept “created by the and for the Chinese” to hurt U.S. business.
\Democrat Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, has advocated shifting the country to 50 percent clean energy by 2030 and promised heavy regulation of fracking.

16,AR,"Village in Alaska votes to relocate due to climate change
",Sebastien Malo / Thomson Reuters Foundation   ,"Aug 18, 2016","NEW YORK — A Native American village in the U.S. state of Alaska has voted to relocate its entire population of some 600 people due to the threat of rising seas, officials said on Thursday.
\Shishmaref, located on a tiny island north of the Bering Strait that separates the United States and Russia, is losing up to 10 feet of shoreline each year, according to research by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Alabama-based Auburn University.
\Shishmaref is one of dozens of indigenous villages in Alaska that face growing threats of flooding and erosion due to global warming, according to a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
\Shishmaref residents, who are members of the Inupiat tribe, voted 89 to 78 to relocate, said Donna Barr, secretary of the Shishmaref Council. Voting took place earlier this week, but the official count has not yet been formally certified and a handful of absentee ballots remain unopened.
\This is not the first time Shishmaref residents have made such a decision. They voted in 2002 to relocate but that effort stalled.
\A few other U.S. communities in Alaska, Washington and Louisiana have decided recently to relocate as well due to climate change and shoreline erosion, according to the Washington, D.C.-based Arctic Institute.
\Several others are likely weighing options to move, said Christina DeConcini, a spokeswoman for the Washington, D.C.-based World Resources Institute.
\“It’s not going to be the last time that the United States has to deal with communities severely threatened by climate change and impacts and whether or not they can stay there,” she said.
\In Shishmaref, Tommy Richter, pastor of the Lutheran Church, the island’s only church, said the community was torn over leaving its heritage behind.
\“There are people here who have been here for generations and don’t want to leave at all,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
\The cost of relocation has been estimated at some $180 million, and authorities are seeking state and federal funding, according to local media.
\Where to relocate remains to be decided, the clerk said. Two vacant sites on the mainland are being considered.
\Relocation could take more than ten years, according to a private feasibility study conducted for Shishmaref and published in February.
\The island, which is seven square miles, lies five miles off the mainland. Its economy is based largely on fishing and hunting.
\Scientists attribute coastal erosion in Shishmaref to global warming that has thawed sea ice that once shielded the island from storm surges. Its permafrost, the layer of permanently frozen soil on which it is built, is melting as well.
\The village already has moved several homes and a National Guard Armory away from its coastline and built sea walls that have had limited success, according to Alaska authorities.
\In March, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced $6.5 million in funding to help Native American communities find ways to deal with climate change.
\Since 2014, more than 140 tribes and tribal organizations have gotten government funding to help address the impacts of global warming, it said.

17,AR,"White House directs federal agencies to consider climate change impacts
",Reuters   ,"Aug 2, 2016","WASHINGTON -- U.S. federal agencies will be required to disclose whether their actions and decisions will have an impact on climate change, the White House announced Tuesday.
\The White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) finalized an update after nearly six years of consultations of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a Nixon-era statute that called on officials to weigh the environmental effects of projects such as highways, dams or oil drilling.
\The update takes NEPA a step further by requiring agencies such as the Interior Department to the Army Corps of Engineers to quantify greenhouse gas emissions in NEPA project reviews and to describe the potential climate change impacts.
\“This increased predictability and certainty will allow decision makers and the public to more fully understand the potential climate impacts of all proposed federal actions,” the CEQ said in a statement.
\This would prompt agencies to consider alternatives or propose measures to mitigate the climate impacts of a project, it said.
\Since the CEQ first proposed to modify NEPA in 2010 to include weighing climate change impacts, Republican lawmakers have discouraged the move saying it would be a way for the Obama administration to regulate carbon emissions without congressional approval.
\President Barack Obama has used executive authority to use the federal Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, oil and gas infrastructure and energy development on public lands.
\Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the CEQ’s announcement is “a game-changer” that would ensure that federal agencies do not “approve mines that will destroy the climate, or bridges that will get washed away.”
\Conservation group The Wilderness Society said the CEQ guidance will ensure that decisions about whether to allow energy exploration or development on federal land do not contribute to climate change.
\“Federal land management agencies should implement this guidance without delay, and use cutting-edge science to make climate-smart decisions,” the group said.

18,AR,"Study: Global cloud coverage shifting in ominous sign of climate change
",NA,"Jul 12, 2016","NEW YORK -- When politicians talk of climate “uncertainty,” they’re often casting doubt on things that are well understood: Warming is happening, and humans are responsible.
\When scientists talk about climate uncertainty, they’re usually talking about the clouds.
\Clouds are tricky because they do two things at once. All that puffy whiteness blocks solar energy from reaching the ground, bouncing it back to space, which provides a net cooling effect. But clouds also act like a blanket, capping and trapping heat in the lower troposphere, which is where people who aren’t on the International Space Station live. That ambiguity makes it difficult to simulate with desirable precision how much and how fast the planet is warming, leaving a big mystery floating lazily over our heads.
\Some of that uncertainty was lifted Monday, and the news isn’t good. A new study in Nature analyzes almost 30 years of weather observations to show that clouds and cloudiness are changing in the way scientists would expect in a warming world. Continental storm tracks -- think jet stream -- are shifting poleward, leaving populous subtropical latitudes uncovered. And the clouds that are forming more often aren’t the low-lying, reflective ones that cool the planet -- they’re the huge cottony anvils that rise high in the sky, trapping more heat.
\“Cloud changes most consistently predicted by global climate models are currently occurring in nature,” the authors write. “As cloud tops rise, their greenhouse effect becomes stronger.”
\Also, as the poleward shift continues, heat from the tropics expands further away from the equator, an unsettling development for already arid cities in places like the U.S. southwest. Less light is reflected away from the hot middle of the Earth, and increased cloud cover toward the poles creates a thickening blanket that warms the world.
\A couple of things make clouds such a conundrum to climate scientists. They form through processes too small to observe, and their layering blocks satellite views of lower clouds and ground views of higher clouds. Satellite coverage goes back only to the late 1970s, with technologies designed for weather monitoring. The new study corrects the weather record to make sense for climate analysis.
\“We don’t have a climate monitoring system,” said Joel Norris, a climatologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the lead author of the new paper. “It’s hard to sustain a long-term climate monitoring program.” Political priorities change, budgets drop, technology evolves, and climate scientists are left having to extract consistent, long-term data from measurements taken without the long term in mind.
\The corrected data should help improve their confidence in cloud studies, which currently isn’t very high.
\The 2013 science overview put out by the authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that although independent sets of cloud observations are similar, “substantial ambiguity and therefore low confidence (remain) in the observations of global-scale cloud variability and trends.”
\“This is an exciting and comprehensive study,” said Kate Marvel, a scientist at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “But other studies have found that these things are happening, and this work provides more evidence of these effects.”
\Next up for the study’s authors is to untangle further how natural events, such as volcanoes, and greenhouse-led warming contribute to the cloud changes. Ultimately, greater understanding of how clouds behave will help strengthen projections of the rate and trajectory of global warming.

19,AR,"White House Announces New Climate Change Data Website
",NA,"Mar 19, 2014","WASHINGTON — As part of its campaign to step up efforts to address climate change, the White House on Wednesday announced the creation of a new website to serve as a one-stop location for the enormous amount of climate data housed at different federal agencies.
\The initiative to make the information more accessible to communities, researchers and industries trying to adapt to global warming is the latest move by the White House to deliver on a pledge that President Barack Obama made last June to use his executive authority to address the causes and effects of climate change in light of congressional inaction on the issue.
\In the administration’s most high-profile effort, the Environmental Protection Agency in September proposed rules to cut greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants.
\NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are spearheading the new Climate Data Initiative, the White House said in a statement. The beta version of climate.data.gov will provide data sets of sea-level rise and coastal flooding. The White House also said the site would eventually provide information about the effects of climate change on the food supply, public health and energy sources.
\The initiative also includes projects being launched in the private sector to provide the data about climate change through apps, “cloud” computing and Web tools.
\“By taking the enormous data sets regularly collected by NASA, NOAA, and other agencies and applying the ingenuity, creativity, and expertise of technologists and entrepreneurs, the Climate Data Initiative will help create easy-to-use tools for regional planners, farmers, hospitals, and businesses across the country — and empower America’s communities to prepare themselves for the future,” John Podesta, a counselor to the president, and John P. Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in a joint statement.
\Over the last few weeks, the White House has rolled out climate change initiatives at a rapid clip. In February, the administration created so-called climate hubs under the Agriculture Department to connect farmers and ranchers with universities, industry groups and federal agencies to help prepare for disasters worsened by climate change, such as wildfires, pests, flooding and drought.
\Obama has also directed the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department to develop a new generation of tougher fuel economy standards for heavy-duty long-haul trucks. The draft rules are due by March 2015 and the final version a year later.
\The president also plans to ask Congress for $1 billion in his 2015 budget to establish a “climate resiliency fund” that would finance research, preparation and infrastructure to adapt to extreme weather driven by global warming.
\NOAA, NASA and other federal agencies provide detailed regular reports about long-term climate trends. NOAA routinely distributes short-term seasonal reports for the country that focus on the outlook for extreme weather events. The Climate Data Initiative aims to host the information in one place where it could be used to create long-term outlooks for towns or regions about the potential effects of climate change, such as the estimates for sea level rises that could affect coastal construction.
\The White House also announced more than a dozen private sector initiatives that would try to build tools and create new ways to disseminate the data. Google, for instance, is working with the Desert Research Institute, the University of Idaho and the University of Nebraska “to provide drought mapping and monitoring for the entire continental United States in near real-time.”
\The nonprofit Climate Central, which reports on climate change, will offer a free Web tool that would provide “local projections, maps, and assessments of exposure to sea level rise and coastal flooding tabulated for every coastal ZIP Code, municipality, county, and state in the U.S.” The assessments would “cover more than 100 demographic, economic, infrastructure and environmental variables using data drawn mainly from federal sources.”

20,AR,"Trump resists releasing taxes, turns to climate change skeptic
",NA,"May 13, 2016","WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump on Friday pushed back against renewed calls that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee release his income tax returns before the election, and picked a prominent climate change skeptic to help him formulate his energy policy.
\American presidential candidates have voluntarily released their tax returns for decades. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have both released their returns.
\Trump, who has all but locked up the Republican Party’s nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, has said the Internal Revenue Service was auditing his returns and he wanted to wait until the review was over before making them public.
\“It should be, and I hope it’s before the election,” Trump told ABC’s “Good Morning America.”
\Trump is building out his policy proposals as he pivots to the general election, including tapping experts in various fields.
\Among those he has asked for help is U.S. Republican Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, one of the country’s most ardent oil and gas drilling advocates and climate change skeptics.
\North Dakota has been at the forefront of the U.S. shale oil and gas boom. Cramer endorsed Trump earlier this year.
\Trump has asked Cramer to write a white paper, or detailed report, on energy policy, according to Cramer and sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
\Cramer was also among a group of Trump advisers who recently met with lawmakers from Western energy states, who hope Trump will open more federal land for drilling, a lawmaker who took part in the meeting said.
\Cramer said in an interview that his paper would emphasize the dangers of foreign ownership of U.S. energy assets, burdensome taxes, and over-regulation. Trump will have an opportunity to float some of the ideas at an energy summit in Bismarck, North Dakota on May 26, Cramer said.
\A spokeswoman for Trump’s campaign did not comment.
\Trump has been light on details of his energy policy so far, though he recently told supporters in West Virginia that the coal industry would thrive if he were president. He has also claimed global warming is a concept “created by and for the Chinese” to hurt U.S. business.
\Clinton has advocated shifting the country to 50 percent clean energy by 2030, promised heavy regulation of fracking, and said her prospective administration would put coal companies “out of business.”
\But the ins and outs of campaigning continue to be a major topic with Trump, who has never held elected office.
\On Friday, the billionaire real estate developer, who has often boasted of his wealth, was asked why he had been willing in the past to release his tax information to Pennsylvania and New Jersey officials when seeking casino licenses, even though he was being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
\“At the time it didn’t make any difference to me. Now it does,” Trump said.
\Pressed on what tax rate he pays, Trump refused to say. “It’s none of your business,” he said.
\“Before 1976, people didn’t do it,” he added. “It used to be a secret thing.” Trump has said there is nothing voters can learn from his tax filings.
\The IRS declined to comment on whether he or any other presidential candidates were being audited.
\However, the Trump campaign earlier this year released a letter from his attorneys saying his personal tax returns have been under “continuous examination” from the IRS.
\This week, Clinton began calling on her probable Republican rival to release his returns, as she has. Last August, the former U.S. secretary of state posted the past eight years of tax returns for her and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, on her website.
\Sanders released his 2014 return in April.
\Presidential candidates have a long history in the modern era of releasing their tax returns.
\“In 1976, Gerald Ford did not release his returns, but he did release some information about his taxes,” said Joseph Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group that provides tax news and analysis.
\“That was the last time that a major party nominee hasn’t done it,” he said.
\Tax filings show sources of income, both from within the United States and other countries, as well as charitable giving, investments, deductions and other financial information.
\Trump said his company was “clean.”
\“I don’t have Swiss bank accounts, I don’t have offshore accounts,” he said.

21,AR,"A campaign to criminalize debate about climate science
",GEORGE WILL   ,"Apr 24, 2016 ","WASHINGTON -- Authoritarianism, always latent in progressivism, is becoming explicit. Progressivism’s determination to regulate thought by regulating speech is apparent in the campaign by 20 state attorneys general, none Republican, to criminalize skepticism about the supposedly “settled” conclusions of climate science. Four core tenets of progressivism are: First, history has a destination. Second, progressives uniquely discern it. (Barack Obama frequently declares things to be on or opposed to “the right side of history.”) Third, politics should be democratic but peripheral to governance, which is the responsibility of experts scientifically administering the regulatory state. Fourth, enlightened progressives should enforce limits on speech (witness IRS suppression of conservative advocacy groups) in order to prevent thinking unhelpful to history’s progressive unfolding. Progressivism is already enforced on campuses by restrictions on speech that might produce what progressives consider retrograde intellectual diversity. Now, from the so-called party of science, aka Democrats, comes a campaign to criminalize debate about science. “The debate is settled,” says Obama. “Climate change is a fact.” Indeed. The epithet “climate change deniers,” obviously coined to stigmatize skeptics as akin to Holocaust deniers, is designed to obscure something obvious: Of course the climate is changing; it never is not changing -- neither before nor after the Medieval Warm Period (end of the 9th century to the 13th) and the Little Ice Age (1640s to 1690s), neither of which was caused by fossil fuels. Today, debatable questions include: To what extent is human activity contributing to climate change? Are climate change models, many of which have generated projections refuted by events, suddenly reliable enough to predict the trajectory of change? Is change necessarily ominous because today’s climate is necessarily optimum? Are the costs, in money expended and freedom curtailed, of combating climate change less than the cost of adapting to it? But these questions may not forever be debatable. The initial target of Democratic “scientific” silencers is ExxonMobil, which they hope to demonstrate misled investors and the public about climate change. There is, however, no limiting principle to restrain unprincipled people from punishing research entities, advocacy groups and individuals. But it is difficult to establish what constitutes culpable “misleading” about climate science, of which a 2001 National Academy of Sciences report says: “Because there is considerable uncertainty in current understanding of how the climate system varies naturally and reacts to emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, current estimates of the magnitude of future warming should be regarded as tentative and subject to future adjustments (either upward or downward).” Did Al Gore “mislead” when he said seven years ago that computer modeling projected the Arctic to be ice-free during the summer in as few as five years? A 21st attorney general, of the Virgin Islands (where ExxonMobil has no business operations or assets), accuses the company with criminal misrepresentation regarding climate change. This, even though before the U.S. government in 2009 first issued an endangerment finding regarding greenhouse gases, ExxonMobil favored a carbon tax to mitigate climate consequences of those gases. This grandstanding attorney general’s contribution to today’s gangster government is the use of law enforcement tools to pursue political goals -- wielding prosecutorial weapons to chill debate, including subpoenaing private donor information from the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank. The party of science, busy protecting science from scrutiny, has forgotten Karl Popper (1902-1994), the philosopher whose “The Open Society and Its Enemies” warned against people incapable of distinguishing between certainty and certitude. In his essay “Science as Falsification,” Popper explains why “the criterion of a scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability, or refutability, or testability.” America’s party of science seems eager to insulate its scientific theories from the possibility of refutation. The leader of the attorneys general, New York’s Eric Schneiderman, dismisses those who disagree with him as “morally vacant.” His moral content is apparent in his campaign to ban fantasy sports gambling because it competes with the gambling (state lottery, casinos, off-track betting) that enriches his government. Then there is Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who suggests using the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, written to fight organized crime, to criminalize what he calls the fossil fuel industry’s “climate denial apparatus.” The Justice Department, which has abetted the IRS cover-up of its criminal activity, has referred this idea to the FBI. These garden-variety authoritarians are eager to regulate us into conformity with the “settled” consensus du jour, whatever it is. But they are progressives, so it is for our own good. George Will’s email address is georgewill@washpost.com.

22,AR,"Probe of Exxon climate change disclosures expands
",NA,"Mar 29, 2016 ","WASHINGTON — The attorneys general of Massachusetts and the U.S. Virgin Islands said on Tuesday they will investigate whether Exxon Mobil Corp. misled investors and the public about the risks of climate change, joining counterparts in New York and California.
\The announcements come just a few months after New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Exxon to demand extensive financial records and emails in connection with its climate change disclosures.
\California Attorney General Kamala Harris followed suit in January, when she confirmed she was also investigating Exxon over the issue.
\Exxon Mobil did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
\Massachusetts’ and the Virgin Islands’ top attorneys joined Schneiderman in New York to announce they will collaborate with 15 other attorneys general on investigations of whether fossil fuel companies have misled investors on climate change risks, as well as other climate-related initiatives.
\Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said fossil fuel companies that have deceived investors about the risk climate change poses to the planet and to their bottom line “must be held accountable.”
\Virgin Islands Attorney General Claude Earl Walker said he wants to ensure there is transparency so consumers can make informed choices about what they purchase.
\“If Exxon Mobil has tried to cloud their judgment, we are determined to hold the company accountable,” he said.
\The attorneys general are also members of a coalition of over 20 states that have filed an amicus brief in support of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan, a rule to crack down on carbon emissions that has been challenged by industry and 25 states in a federal appeals court.
\The probes of Exxon were triggered by investigative reports last year by Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times that showed the company’s in-house scientists had flagged concerns about climate change decades ago, which the company ignored or contradicted.
\Investors also have started to target Exxon over the climate issue. Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that Exxon must include a climate change resolution on its annual shareholder proxy.
\The Rockefeller Family Fund said last week it will divest from fossil fuels as quickly as possible and “eliminate holdings” of Exxon.
\Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, an active climate policy advocate, joined the attorneys general at the announcement, calling it a “turning point” in a broader effort to hold fossil fuel companies to account for their efforts to slow the response to climate change.
\Gore compared fossil fuel companies’ failure to disclose or downplaying the risks of climate change to the tobacco industry’s efforts to promote smoking in spite of health warnings.
\The Massachusetts and Virgin Islands attorneys general did not elaborate on what legal tools they will rely on to guide their investigations of Exxon.
\However, legal experts have said that states generally have a few options at their disposal, including various consumer protection laws and “blue sky” securities laws.
\The New York probe, for instance, is hinging on the state’s powerful Martin Act, an anti-fraud law, as well as its consumer protection statutes.
\Some experts say the issues at the heart of the Exxon probes could potentially trigger federal racketeering and organized crime (RICO) laws that were used by the Justice Department in its landmark case against the big tobacco companies.

23,AR,"Rockefeller Family Fund Hits Exxon On Climate Change, Divests From Fossil Fuels
",NA,"Mar 23, 2016","HOUSTON/NEW YORK — The Rockefeller Family Fund said on Wednesday it will divest from fossil fuels as quickly as possible and “eliminate holdings” of Exxon Mobil Corp., saying the oil company associated with the family fortune has misled the public about climate change risks.
\The U.S.-based charity will also divest its coal and Canadian oil sands holdings. Though the endowment has a modest $130 million in total assets, the move is notable because a century ago John D. Rockefeller Sr. made a fortune running Standard Oil, a precursor to Exxon Mobil.
\Given the threat posed to the survival of human and natural ecosystems, “there is no sane rationale for companies to continue to explore for new sources of hydrocarbons,” the fund said.
\Exxon did not immediately comment. Many oil industry leaders have argued that millions of people in the developing world would be condemned to darkness and poverty if society halted the burning of fossil fuels anytime in the next several decades, before there is an ample supply of cleaner energy sources.
\Shares of Exxon were down 0.47 percent at $83.74 each on a day when oil prices were slipping and U.S. stock indexes were also down slightly.
\The Rockefeller fund did not detail the size of its fossil fuel holdings or holdings of Exxon stock.
\In a letter posted on its website, the Rockefeller Family Fund said Exxon’s conduct on climate issues appears to be “morally reprehensible.”
\In November, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman launched an investigation into whether Exxon misled the public and shareholders about the risks of climate change.
\At the time, the company said it has included information about the business risk of climate change for many years in its quarterly filings, corporate citizenship report and in other reports to shareholders.
\Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson has openly talked about the reality of climate change. The company has said it has constructively contributed to climate research for years.
\As early as 2008, members of the Rockefeller family called on Exxon to make governance changes and increase spending on alternative fuels.
\In late 2014, another fund associated with the family, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund (RBF), and several other philanthropies and non-governmental organizations said they would divest from fossil fuel-related investments.

24,AR,"USDA Chief Says Climate Change Already Hurting Farmers
",NA,"Feb 5, 2014","WASHINGTON — Climate change is already hurting American farmers and rural residents, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Wednesday, warning that the U.S. would regret any failure to adapt and prepare for shifting weather realities.
\Unveiling a new effort to coordinate the government’s response, Vilsack said extreme weather events have already taken the U.S. by surprise, putting ranchers and others out of business. He pointed to the intensity and frequency of recent storms, long droughts, snowstorms and subzero weather as evidence that climate change is no longer hypothetical or in the future.
\“The combination of all those factors convinces me that the climate is changing, and it’s going to have its impact, and will have its impact, and is having its impact on agriculture and forestry,” Vilsack said.
\Pine bark beetle that in years past were killed off during harsh winters have now infected about 45 million trees in western states, leading to more severe forest fires, posing flood risks and threatening the timber industry, Vilsack said. In the absence of adequate forecasting and disaster assistance, he said, an October snowstorm wiped out entire cattle operations in the Dakotas.
\“When that snowstorm hit, it didn’t wipe out just a few animals. It wiped out the entire operation,” Vilsack said. “Nobody anticipated and expected that severe a storm, that early.”
\To that end, the Obama administration said seven new “climate hubs” will open in regions across the U.S., acting as clearinghouses for data and research about effects of climate change. Based out of existing Agriculture Department facilities, the hubs will assess local climate risks, such as drought and wildfire, then develop plans for dealing with them, such as improved irrigation techniques.
\The goal is to synchronize the federal government’s preparation and resources with what other entities, such as universities, tribal communities and state governments, are doing to prepare for shifting temperatures.
\“It’s taking existing avenues, research service or forest service, and charging them with a new responsibility to basically take a look at precisely what risks are currently being recognized and what’s the vulnerability to agriculture and to forestry in each region of the country,” Vilsack said.
\Vilsack disclosed the locations for the new hubs, which were announced last year and included in Obama’s broader climate change plan. The seven regional hubs will be housed in forest service stations or government research labs in Ames, Iowa; Durham, N.H.; Raleigh, N.C.; Fort Collins, Colo.; El Reno, Okla.; Corvallis, Ore.; and Las Cruces, N.M. Three smaller “sub-hubs” will be created in Houghton, Mich.; Davis, Calif.; and Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico.

25,AR,"Why Climate Change Is Really, Really Unfair
",NA,"Feb 5, 2016","With his 2015 encyclical “Laudato Si,” Pope Frances went further than perhaps anyone has before to reframe the entire debate around climate change by focusing on the world’s poor and the duty to protect them from environmental harms that they did not cause themselves.
\Now, new research in the journal Scientific Reports has underscored the pope’s message by showing that when it comes to climate change, it is indeed the countries with the most to lose that tend to contribute to the problem least — and also the other way round. The countries that contribute most to the problem — such as China and the United States, the current top two emitters — tend to show less relative vulnerability to the impact compared with nations that have quite low levels of emissions, the research finds.
\“The general rule is, at a global scale, if you’re a nation that is going to suffer from climate change, you’re very likely not contributing to the problem,” says James Watson, a professor in the school of geography at the University of Queensland in Australia who also works with the Wildlife Conservation Society on climate change. Watson conducted the study with two colleagues from the University of Queensland.
\“That’s the general rule that we found,” Watson continues. “But it’s completely inequitable.”
\Many have observed this — including small island nations, which successfully lobbied to have the extra-protective climate target of 1.5 degrees Celsius included in the Paris climate agreement in December — but the new research has done something else: quantified it.
\To do so, Watson and his colleagues compared two datasets. The first is a dataset kept by the World Resources Institute of the present-day emissions of countries around the world. Clearly, the relative contributions to the problem are quite unbalanced. The study notes that just 10 countries currently contribute more than 60 percent of all emissions, and a single one, China, contributes more than 20 percent (or did in 2010, which was the year used for the study).
\The second dataset is a “Climate Vulnerability Monitor” kept by the humanitarian group DARA, which ranks countries according to vulnerability based on measures such as exposure to sea-level rise and drought, health hazards, risks of extremes or disasters, and more. Here, 17 countries were rated as “acutely vulnerable,” and they tended to be either island nations such as Vanuatu or African nations such as Gambia.
\And the result? Sure enough, the research found — based on 2010 emissions and 2010 vulnerability levels — widespread inequity. The study noted, “20 of the 36 highest emitting countries are among the least vulnerable to negative impacts of future climate change... . Conversely, 11 of the 17 countries with low or moderate GHG emissions, are acutely vulnerable to negative impacts of climate change.”
\The research also looked toward the future, when the number of climate-vulnerable countries grows as climate change itself becomes worse. In 2030, there are expected to be 62 “acutely” vulnerable countries, rather than 17. Again, small island nations and African nations lead the way. And inequity, the study found, is expected to be even worse.
\Climate equity concerns were a key factor in the decision in Paris late last year to include the 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature target in a historic climate accord. The idea of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels has long been championed by small island nations, as well as a growing body of climate-vulnerable nations, and for understandable reasons; it limits their impacts.
\However, it is generally agreed upon that the world is well off course if we want to hold warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. (We are currently at about 1 degree warmer than the late 19th century.) Indeed, many scientists say it won’t be possible without overshooting the goal and then coming back down again thanks to future technologies that will be capable of removing carbon dioxide from the air on a vast scale.
\Granted, although the effects of climate change may be very disproportionate, it’s also becoming clear that the major emitters are also going to see their share of problems. Recent research, for instance, points to a major warming of waters off the U.S. East Coast that could have large implications for fisheries, storms, and sea-level rise.
\So it’s not that the major emitters won’t suffer any impacts — but that those impacts aren’t likely to be distributed across the globe in proportion to emissions. Watson likens the current research on climate inequity to prior findings about secondhand smoke: “The people suffering from the impacts of smoking aren’t the smokers themselves, it’s the people next door,” he says.

\It is, in fact, even less new than the 1970s. Way back in February 1861, John Tyndall of Ireland delivered an address at Britain’s scientific Royal Society expressing the same concerns. Tyndall’s experiments showed that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere absorbed heat, as from sunlight, over 100 times more than oxygen and nitrogen (the primary components of a “normal” atmosphere). The implications were clear. The more carbon dioxide in the skies, the warmer would be the air.
\As has been said, facts is facts. Other normal cyclical changes may be in play, but whether you are an oil company executive, a politician with voters in a nearby oil producing state, or the average man on the street, to ignore the facts of this human push toward warming with a head-in-the-sand mentality is not showing intelligent understanding. Agreeing there is a problem is the first step toward solving it.

27,AR,"Pope Calls On U.S. To Fight Climate Change
",NA ,"Sep 23, 2015","WASHINGTON, Sept 23 (Reuters) — Pope Francis on Wednesday urged the United States to help tackle climate change and called on Americans to build a truly tolerant and inclusive society, as he struck a political tone on his first visit to the world’s richest nation.
\In a speech on the White House South Lawn, the Argentine pontiff lauded President Barack Obama’s efforts to reduce air pollution, months after Francis made the environment one of his top issues by issuing a landmark “encyclical” letter.
\“It seems clear to me also that climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation. When it comes to the care of our common home, we are living at a critical moment of history,” the pope said at a welcoming ceremony.
\Apart from the environment, Francis touched on several issues on the U.S. political agenda in the run up to the November 2016 presidential election, such as immigration, inequality and religious freedom.
\In an era of renewed racial tensions in the country, he invoked America’s best known civil rights leader, the late Rev. Martin Luther King, to make points about the environment and equality.
\As Washington streets were closed and federal workers stayed home, about 15,000 people gathered in bright sunshine on the South Lawn. They heard the 78-year-old pope depart from his usual practice and give a speech in English.
\He again made a gesture of simplicity, pulling up beside the South Lawn in the small black Fiat car he used for his arrival in the U.S. capital on Tuesday.
\Francis is a frequent critic of the damage caused to the world’s poor and the environment by capitalism’s excesses.
\Obama, whose plans for a climate change bill were thwarted in Congress early in his presidency, said he shared the pope’s concerns about the environment.
\“Holy Father, you remind us that we have a sacred obligation to protect our planet - God’s magnificent gift to us. We support your call to all world leaders to support the communities most vulnerable to a changing climate and to come together to preserve our precious world for future generations,” Obama said.
\Francis and Obama headed into the White House for talks. Both men see eye-to-eye on climate change and defense of the poor but hold different views on abortion rights and gay marriage.
\Francis gave his support to traditional marriage, pointing out that he will travel to Philadelphia later in his six-day visit to the United States for a meeting of Catholics “to celebrate and support the institutions of marriage and the family.”
\ADORING CROWDS
\The leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics, Francis sprinkled some stardust in a city that is not unduly impressed with important foreign visitors.
\“We love you Pope Francis!” one person shouted as the White House ceremony ended. The crowd of invited guests erupted in cheers.
\“No words can describe it. It’s just awesome,” said Maria Manzo, 79, of New Jersey who attended the event.
\Adoring schoolchildren cheered the pontiff when he left the Vatican Embassy on Wednesday morning. Thousands of the faithful gathered ten deep at places to greet him on a parade through the streets of downtown Washington later in the day.
\The first Latin American pope, Francis has electrified liberal-leaning U.S. Catholics, Democrats and many non-Catholics with a shift in emphasis toward concern for the poor and immigrants and his appeals to combat climate change. But his criticism of unbridled capitalism has unsettled U.S. conservatives.
\In an apparent nod to the fierce debate in the United States about illegal immigration, Francis described himself as the son of an immigrant Italian family in Argentina. “I am happy to be a guest in this country, which was largely built by such families,” he said at the White House.
\Francis said on Tuesday that his teachings on economic fairness and climate change are “all in the social doctrine of the Church.”
\In his White House speech, he paraphrased King’s 1963 “I Have A Dream” speech, saying that the world has “defaulted on a promissory note” to the planet and millions of marginalized people.
\Francis will give the first speech by any pope to the U.S. Congress on Thursday, an address to the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Friday and an open-air Mass in Philadelphia where 1.5 million people are expected to attend.
\The pope speaks to U.S. bishops on Wednesday then celebrates Mass at the one of the most important Roman Catholic churches in the United States, the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington.
\There, he will canonize 18th century Spanish missionary Friar Junipero Serra over the objections of critics who say that Serra suppressed Native American cultures in what is now California.

28,AR,"Pope Francis’ First-Day Agenda: Climate Change, Sex Abuse, Immigration
",NA,"Sep 23, 2015","WASHINGTON — In his first full day in the United States, Pope Francis has already touched on a wide range of controversies, including the long-running sexual abuse scandal that continues to shake the Roman Catholic Church at its core.
\Speaking to hundreds of bishops at St. Matthew’s Cathedral in downtown Washington, he acknowledged the damage of the scandal had caused — both to victims and the clergy.
\“I realize how much the pain of recent years has weighed upon you and I have supported your generous commitment to bring healing to victims — in the knowledge that in healing we too are healed — and to work to ensure that such crimes will never be repeated,” he said.
\For all of his popularity as a humble servant of the poor and dispossessed, Francis has faced criticism from sexual abuse victims that he has done too little to make amends or prevent more abuse.
\Soon after taking over the leadership of the church in 2013, Francis created a commission to develop policies for protecting children from pedophile priests. He also pledged to create a Vatican tribunal to investigate bishops who covered up abuse.
\But the church has continued to fight sexual abuse lawsuits and refused to open its records naming thousands of priests who have been accused. It has also continued to oppose efforts to reform statute of limitations laws that have shielded priests from prosecution.
\Earlier Wednesday, the pontiff appeared with President Barack Obama before a crowd of 11,000 gathered on the South Lawn of the White House, where Francis spent most of his opening speech to America talking about one of the country’s most divisive political issues: global warming.
\“It seems clear to me also that climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation,” he said. “When it comes to the care of our ‘common home,’ we are living at a critical moment of history.”
\His remarks followed an introduction by Obama, who hailed the pontiff’s humble style and powerful advocacy for the poor.
\“From the busy streets of Buenos Aires to remote villages in Kenya, Catholic organizations serve the poor, minister to prisoners, build schools and homes, and operate orphanages and hospitals,” Obama said. “And just as the church has stood with those struggling to break the chains of poverty, it has given voice and hope to those seeking to break the chains of violence and oppression.”
\Obama noted how Francis’ personal touch has earned him admiration throughout the world. In his groundbreaking papacy — the first non-European and first Jesuit pope, and also the first “to share an encyclical through a Twitter account” — Obama said Francis had set a “profound moral example” in challenging people of all faiths to follow God’s call.
\“In these gentle but firm reminders of our obligations to God and to one another, you are shaking us out of complacency,” the president said. “All of us may, at times, experience discomfort when we contemplate the distance between how we lead our daily lives and what we know to be true and right. But I believe such discomfort is a blessing, for it points to something better. You shake our conscience from slumber; you call on us to rejoice in Good News, and give us confidence that we can come together, in humility and service, and pursue a world that is more loving, more just, and more free.”
\“We love you, Pope Francis!” somebody shouted as the pontiff and the president walked into the White House. They soon emerged on the balcony with first lady Michelle Obama, waving to the crowd below.
\The ceremony marked the beginning of Francis’ first full day in the United States, a journey that will include visits to soaring cathedrals as well as a gritty part of East Harlem, and feature speeches sure to touch upon hot-button political issues that have defined his leadership of the church.
\He wasted no time Wednesday, alluding to his support for gentler immigration policies by introducing himself as “the son of an immigrant family” and as a “guest of this country, which was largely built by such families.”
\But his speech quickly shifted to climate change. While praising Obama for efforts to reduce air pollution, he said much more action is needed to protect the Earth for those who will inherit it.
\Invoking Martin Luther King Jr., he said: “We can say that we have defaulted on a promissory note and now is the time to honor it.”
\It is one of several positions that have endeared him to the political left. He has also been a forceful critic of economic inequality and the excesses of capitalism.
\Still, in tenor and tone, Francis has pushed back against efforts to place him in a liberal or conservative category of American politics.
\He spoke Wednesday of the importance of “safeguarding the rights of individuals and communities,” including “their rights to religious liberty” — keywords that clearly acknowledge the concerns of religious and conservative Americans.
\Francis also touched on his support for marriage as between a man and a woman, saying he will travel to Philadelphia to “support the institutions of marriage and the family at this, a critical moment in the history of our civilization.”
\From the White House, he proceeded in a parade route past President’s Park and the National Mall, finally making his way to St. Matthew’s Cathedral for a midday prayer with U.S. bishops.
\Massive crowds lined the route, with long lines waiting at security checkpoints.
\“This is a once in a lifetime opportunity,” said Nick Fontana of Washington, who came with his wife, Wanda, and 7-year-old daughter, Virginia, a Catholic school student allowed to miss class Wednesday.
\Peru native Mimaribel Guillen, 50, of Paterson, N.J., came with her friend Max Rodriguez, 51, of Mexico. Holding American and papal flags, she said having a pope from Latin America is special.
\“We think he is going to think more about our problems,” she said. “He cannot do everything but maybe he can make a little change.”
\In the afternoon, the pope was to visit the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception to celebrate the canonization Mass for Junipero Serra, the Spanish friar who came to Mexico in 1749 to convert Native Americans and established nine Catholic missions in what is now California. A controversial figure to this day, Serra will become the first Latino saint in the U.S.
\This is the first time the pope, 78, has ever been to the United States. He was born and grew up in Argentina, where he spent the early part of his career in the clergy.
\Francis is the first pope from Latin America, and his selection by cardinals in March 2013 is widely seen as a nod to the growing importance of the continent in the future of the church.
\He was selected after the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI amid declining membership, a long-running sexual abuse scandal, and corruption and infighting among Vatican officials. His popularity soared nearly overnight, thanks to a humble style and an emphasis on serving the poor and the dispossessed.
\He eschewed the papal apartment and traditional velvet red footwear in favor of simple living quarters in the Vatican and basic black shoes. He blessed a beggar by kissing his feet.
\Francis remains committed to church doctrine, with its prohibitions on abortion and birth control, gay marriage and women serving in the priesthood.
\Still, even on those issues, he has changed the tone of the church, preaching a spirit of forgiveness over condemnation. “Who am I to judge?” he famously said in 2013 while talking to reporters about gay priests.
\The last pope to come to the United States was Benedict in 2008. Pope Paul VI visited once in 1965, while Pope John Paul II visited seven times in the 1980s and 1990s.
\Francis will also travel to New York and Philadelphia and return to Rome on Sunday. (Times staff writer Alan Zarembo contributed to this report from Los Angeles.)

29,AR,"Obama Commits To Tough Push On Climate Change
",NA,"Jun 20, 2013","WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama is planning a major push using executive powers to tackle the pollution blamed for global warming in an effort to make good on promises he made at the start of his second term. “We know we have to do more -- and we will do more,” Obama said Wednesday in Berlin.
\Obama’s senior energy and climate adviser, Heather Zichal, said the plan would boost energy efficiency of appliances and buildings, plus expand renewable energy. She also said the Environmental Protection Agency was preparing to use its authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate heat-trapping pollution from coal-fired power plants.
\“The EPA has been working very hard on rules that focus specifically on greenhouse gases from the coal sector,” Zichal said.
\Zichal, speaking at a forum hosted by The New Republic in Washington, said that none of the proposals would require new funding or action from Congress. It has shown no appetite for legislation that would put a price on carbon dioxide after a White House-backed bill to set up a market-based system died in Obama’s first term with Democrats in charge.
\The plan, with details expected to be made public in coming weeks, comes as Obama has been under increasing pressure from environmental groups and lawmakers from states harmed by Superstorm Sandy to cut pollution from existing power plants, the largest source of climate-altering gases. Several major environmental groups and states have threatened to sue the administration to force cuts to power plant emissions. And just last week, former Vice President Al Gore, a prominent climate activist and fellow Democrat, pointedly called on Obama to go beyond “great words” to “great actions.”
\It was unclear whether the White House’s plans would include controls on existing power plants. An administration official, who wasn’t authorized to comment on the plan by name, said the White House was still weighing it. But since the administration has already proposed action on future power plants, the law would likely compel it to eventually tackle the remaining plants, or it would be forced to through litigation.
\Obama’s remarks in Berlin echoed comments he made in his State of the Union and inaugural speeches this year.
\“This is the global threat of our time,” Obama said Wednesday. “And for the sake of future generations, our generation must move toward a global compact to confront a changing climate before it is too late. That is our job. That is our task. We have to get to work.”
\Some environmentalists who cheered those remarks when they were made months ago, criticized them Wednesday.
\“President Obama deserves praise for including climate change among the long-term threats facing us all,” said Ned Helme, president of the Center for Clear Air Policy, an environmentally friendly think tank. “But he should do more than talk about the problem. The president needs to put the full force of his office behind new regulations that will truly curb greenhouse gas emissions. For too long now, he has produced little action. I’m encouraged that he will finally act and not just ask.”
\Meanwhile, the environmental community is growing impatient.
\“I really can’t understand why they haven’t moved forward on this more quickly, and we hope that turns around,” said Nathan Wilcox of Environment America.
\An orchestrated and well-publicized campaign to persuade Obama to reject the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which would carry oil extracted from tar sands in western Canada to refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast, appears to be an uphill battle.
\Opponents call the $7 billion project a “carbon bomb” that would carry “dirty oil” and exacerbate global warming. But the State Department in an environmental evaluation concluded that other means of transporting the oil would be worse from a climate perspective.

",NA,"Jul 27, 2015","DES MOINES, Iowa — U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Monday described climate change as “one of most urgent threats of our time” and vowed to meet the challenge with a plan to generate enough clean energy to power every U.S. home by 2027.
\The Democratic front-runner compared fighting climate change to the race to put an American on the moon by the end of the 1960s.
\“The next decade will be as decisive for climate change as the decade for getting to the moon was for space exploration,” Clinton said at a campaign stop in Iowa, which will hold the first presidential nominating contest in February.
\“Sea levels are rising, ice caps are melting, storms, wildfires and extreme weather are wreaking havoc. This is one of most urgent threats of our time and we have no choice but to rise and meet it,” said Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in the November 2016 election.
\Clinton promised to have more than half a billion solar

\The former secretary of state has been under pressure from Democratic presidential rival Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described socialist who has called for swift action on climate change, and environmental activists anxious to see her spell out details of a climate plan.
\She vowed to “stop the giveaways to big oil companies” and to defend President Barack Obama’s plan to reduce emissions from power plants, which is hitting the coal industry.
\More details of Clinton’s climate change agenda will be released over the next few months.
\The Republican National Committee said Clinton’s energy policies were vague and aimed at distracting attention from the controversy of her use of a private email account while she ran the State Department.
\“Hillary Clinton’s energy ‘plan’ is to raise more taxes and double down on President Obama’s EPA overreach, which held down wages and cost American jobs. Clinton avoided specifics and refused to take a position on important job-creating energy projects like the Keystone pipeline, reminding voters why they think she’s untrustworthy,” said RNC spokesman Michael Short.

31,AR,"Obama Warns Of Threat That Climate Change Poses To National Security
",NA,"May 20, 2015","NEW LONDON, Conn. — President Barack Obama warned Wednesday that climate change poses an “immediate risk to our national security” so significant that U.S. military forces will have to adjust how they train and operate.
\In a speech to the graduating class of cadets at the Coast Guard Academy here, Obama noted the dangers of rising sea levels that threaten health and safety in coastal areas and pointed to volatile new storm systems, droughts and wildfires that endanger the rest of the world.
\“This is not just a problem for countries on the coast or for certain regions of the world,” he said. “Climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security, and make no mistake: It will impact how our military defends our country.
\“We need to act,” Obama said, “and we need to act now.”
\The call to action comes as Obama pursues a global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The White House hopes to close an ambitious deal with sweeping goals at a December summit in Paris.
\Crucial to that push is a good-faith display by the U.S. to cut its own emissions. Obama wants the country to cut greenhouse gases dramatically over the next decade.
\In his address to the new class of Coast Guard officers, Obama made a sales pitch for his climate agenda: that national and global security depend on it.
\It’s a strategy that he has employed recently in an effort to sell his trade and economic policies, as he argues that U.S. security depends in part on building new and strong commercial and financial ties to the rest of the world.
\The argument is based on the world’s common problem of climate change and related security concerns.
\Drought and famine have made basic resources like food and water scarce, leading to instability around the world, he said. Violent storms force people from their homes.
\The stakes, Obama argued Wednesday, are high.
\Denying climate change or refusing to deal with it undermines American readiness, he said.
\“We cannot and must not ignore a peril that can affect generations,” Obama said, noting that some in Washington don’t believe in taking action to deal with climate change.
\Scientists know it’s happening, Obama said, and “the Coast Guard knows it’s happening.”
\Climate change poses a threat to the readiness of American forces, he said, ticking off floods at bases in Norfolk, Va., damage from thawing permafrost at military facilities in Alaska and the possibility of extensive droughts and wildfires threatening training areas in the West.
\For its part, the Pentagon is assessing the vulnerability of more than 7,000 military bases, installations and other facilities around the world as a result of climate change.
\The departments of Defense and Homeland Security have been studying how to deal with the security implications of melting sea ice in the Arctic.
\If the military is taking steps to deal with climate change, said one member of Congress, it should inspire others to do the same.
\“Our military takes the world as it is, not as ideologues would hope it to be,” said Rep. Ted W. Lieu, D-Calif., a veteran. “Our nonpartisan military is telling the American public that climate change is real, it is happening, and we must act.”
\Obama urged the officers to embrace the challenge before them.
\“You are part of the first generation of officers to begin your service in a world where the effects of climate change are so clearly upon us,” he told the graduating cadets. “Climate change will shape how every one of our services plan, operate, train, equip, and protect their infrastructure, today and for the long term.”

32,AR,"Oklahoma Attorney General Vows To Fight Climate Change Rules
",NA,"May 6, 2015","WASHINGTON — Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt vowed Tuesday to continue fighting proposed climate change rules in court, as he and other conservatives accused the Obama administration of pushing environmental requirements on states far beyond traditional boundaries.
\Testifying before a Senate subcommittee, Pruitt said the Environmental Protection Agency is using an “obscure” section of law to tell states what mix of sources they should use to generate electricity.
\“No state should comply with the Clean Power Plan if it means surrendering decision-making authority to the EPA,” Pruitt said. “States should be left to make decisions on fuel diversity that best meet their power generation needs.”
\A prominent environmental law attorney said Pruitt and other opponents of the proposed rules to reduce carbon dioxide were making “novel legal arguments” that didn’t square with the facts or history.
\“Under EPA’s proposal, states have a choice,” said Lisa Heinzerling, who has won major Clean Air Act cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.
\“They may devise their own plan to meet the state’s specific targets EPA will set, or they may let EPA devise a plan for them. This is the very same choice states have had for 45 years under the air quality standards program of the Clean Air Act. It is not an unconstitutional choice.”
\The EPA is expected to finalize standards this summer for how states can best reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent in the next 15 years. Pruitt and more than a dozen other states already are suing the EPA over the proposal, but a federal appeals court here may decide the case is premature.
\States are expected to be given a year to devise a plan for meeting the carbon reduction targets. Pruitt complained at the hearing that Oklahoma already is generating 15 percent of its electricity from wind, making it more difficult to reduce emissions by another 30 percent.
\Gov. Mary Fallin issued an executive order last week prohibiting executive agencies from working on a state plan. She then vetoed a bill that Pruitt supported that would have allowed the state to submit a plan that met the attorney general’s approval.
\Whether the state submits a plan or not, Pruitt said, the EPA will be challenged in court by Oklahoma and other states if it moves forward with its plan.
\Taking Sides
\At the hearing, the main opponents of the proposed rule were from energy-producing states — Oklahoma, West Virginia and Wyoming. Those defending the proposed rules were from East Coast states that produce little of their own energy.
\Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Tulsa, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, said Congress had repeatedly rejected legislative efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Now, he said, the administration is trying to accomplish the same goals through regulations that would have little impact on worldwide carbon levels.
\Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., said carbon reduction was essential for states like his that were already being affected by climate change.
\“The longer we wait to reduce our carbon output, the more severe, and perhaps irreversible, the effects of climate change will become,” Carper said.
\Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., tried to get Pruitt and the attorney general from West Virginia to say whether climate change was a problem. Neither answered the direct question but instead told Whitehouse that the EPA shouldn’t be able to address climate change outside of a legal framework.
\“I think the process matters that the EPA engages in ...,” Pruitt said.
\“I didn’t ask you a process question,” Whitehouse said. “I asked you a question about whether climate change is a real problem anywhere in the world.”
\“I think the question about climate action ... is something that’s a policy consideration of this Congress,” Pruitt said. “If you want EPA to address that in a direct way, you can amend the Clean Air Act to provide that authority and the statutory power to do so ... so that the states can know how to conduct themselves in a way that is consistent with statutory construction.”
\“So to be clear, neither of the attorneys general present will concede that climate change is a real problem anywhere in the world,” Whitehouse said.
\“Senator, I think it’s immaterial to discussions about the legal framework of the Clean Air Act,” Pruitt said.
\“Immaterial or not, I get to ask questions. So, it’s material to my question,” Whitehouse said.
\Neither Pruitt nor the West Virginia attorney general responded.

33,AR,"Study: 75 Percent Of Extreme Weather Due To Climate Change
",NA,"Apr 27, 2015","NEW YORK — Blame global warming for about 75 percent of the world’s unusually hot days and 18 percent of its extreme snow or rain, according to a new paper in the journal Nature Climate Change.
\Heat waves and heavy storms are occurring at least four times more often than they did before carbon pollution started driving up thermometers. Global average temperatures are now about 0.85 degrees Celsius (1.4 Fahrenheit) higher than before industrialization.
\Additional heat and precipitation are expensive. Severe weather costs the U.S. economy as much as $33 billion a year, according to a U.S. Energy Department report released April 21.
\And those figures will increase as the planet continues to warm, as climate change may not be smooth or gradual, according to the new paper. At 2 degrees Celsius — United Nations climate negotiators’ avowed upper limit — extremely hot days may be twice as likely as at 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. After 2 degrees Celsius, the odds of high-heat days may be five times greater than today.
\“What used to be a one-in-a-thousand day, a one-in-three year event, actually occurs four times in three years,” Erich Fischer, a researcher at the Institute for Atmospheric & Climate Science in Zurich and one of the study’s authors, said in a telephone interview. “Weather extremes have always been occurring, before any human influence, but that doesn’t mean that there can’t be human influence on the extremes.”
\There is widespread scientific consensus that human activity is causing climate change, which President Barack Obama said “can no longer be denied” while visiting the Florida Everglades last week.
\Fischer and colleague Reto Knutti examined more than a century’s worth of data using more than two dozen climate models, running simulations that account for rising greenhouse- gas emission levels through the year 2100. Fischer was quick to emphasize the global nature of their results. The study is confined to heat and precipitation. How might evolving conditions affect meteorological events like tornadoes or hail? “We do not agree how they change,” he said.
\Global warming’s responsibility for the world’s heavy rainfall may increase from 18 percent today to 40 percent if temperatures rise by 2 degrees Celsius.
\The authors said that their results may be of use to policy makers, by sharpening their understanding of risk as climate change worsens. “With every degree of warming,” they wrote, “it is the rarest and the most extreme events — and thereby the ones with typically the highest socioeconomic impacts — for which the largest fraction is due to human-induced greenhouse gas emissions.”
\Translation: The worse things get, the more we’re bringing it on ourselves.

34,AR,"White House To Explore How Climate Change Makes You Sick
",NA,"Apr 7, 2015","WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama is launching an initiative Tuesday aimed at highlighting the connections between climate change and public health, bringing both medical and data experts to the White House this week.
\As part of the effort, the White House is to hold a Climate Change and Health Summit later this spring, featuring Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. The administration is expanding its Climate Data Initiative, which it launched a year ago, to include more than 150 health-relevant data sets.
\“Climate change is posing a threat to more people, in more places, to their public health,” said White House senior adviser Brian Deese in a phone call with reporters Tuesday.
\White House officials also announced Tuesday that a coalition of deans from 30 medical, public health and nursing schools has pledged to train their students to address climate change’s health impacts. Those universities include Johns Hopkins, the University of Maryland, Harvard University and the University of Nebraska.
\There is a clear political component to Tuesday’s announcement: In a roundtable event at Howard University, Obama will meet with not just public experts and senior administration officials but the mother of a child suffering from asthma. Asthma is exacerbated by warmer temperatures that contribute to the formation of smog, and Deese cited a recent study by the American Thoracic Society that found that seven out of 10 doctors reported climate change is contributing to more health problems among their patients.
\“One thing that we know is the most salient arguments around climate change are the ones around health impacts and involve meeting people where they are,” Deese said.
\As part of that effort, the interagency U.S. Global Change Research Program is releasing a draft Climate and Health Assessment report that will detail how public health is influenced by changes in weather extremes, air quality and vector-borne diseases.
\The new initiative will also call on private sector firms to devise solutions to health-related climate problems. Microsoft researcher Ethan Jackson told reporters that his company is launching a pilot program to see if it can use autonomous equipment to monitor the density of mosquitoes in a given areas as a way of detecting a potential disease outbreak before it happens.
\Jackson noted that there is clear evidence that climate change contributes to “the movement of pathogens and vector-borne diseases. But it is still difficult to predict the time and place where disease will occur.”
\The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will also release an “Adaptation in Action Report” Tuesday to highlight actions that state and local leaders have taken to minimize the health impacts of global warming in New York, San Francisco, Maine, Minnesota, Arizona, Michigan, California and New York state.

35,AR,"Oklahoma wind farms help Google build on renewable energy goal
",Adam Wilmoth / The Oklahoman,"Dec 11, 2016","PRYOR, Okla. — Two new Oklahoma wind farms expected online early next year will help Google meet its goal of providing 100 percent of its energy needs from renewable resources.
\The new Oklahoma wind farms are among nearly 1,700 megawatts of new renewable power the company has agreed to buy when it comes online next year. The projects will allow Google to supply 100 percent of its energy needs with power from wind and solar projects.
\Google already buys power from the 101-megawatt Minco II wind farm near Minco and 48 megawatts from the 298-megawatt Canadian Hills project. The new 198-megawatt Bluestem project in Beaver County and the 225-megawatt
\Great Western project near Woodward are scheduled online early next year. Together, Google will buy 572 megawatts of Oklahoma wind, more than 10 percent of the state’s wind capacity.
\Google buys electricity from local power grids, which include power generated from several sources. But the company has partnered with wind and solar energy companies to develop renewable energy projects throughout the world.
\“We buy power from new generation, new projects,” said Neha Palmer, Google’s head of energy strategy and global infrastructure. “This ensures the project is displacing brown power on the grid. We buy renewable energy above and beyond what is required by legislation to ensure the energy we’re buying is new renewable energy.”
\Google has 20 power purchase agreements totaling 2.6 gigawatts of clean energy from renewable projects. Using renewable energy also has a financial benefit to the company, Palmer said.
\“Electricity costs are one of the biggest costs for data centers,” she said.
\That is especially true in developing countries. In Chile, electricity costs can range from $30 to several hundred dollars a megawatt hour. Google recently signed a deal for an 80-megawatt solar project in the country.
\“Having fixed costs for power in Chile is an important part of our business,” Naha said.
\Google has spent $3.5 billion on capital investment as part of its renewable energy effort, including $850 million in Oklahoma.
\“With the way the pricing of renewable energy has gone over the past few years, it’s gotten cost competitive,” Kava said. “With the construction of these large power purchase agreements for renewables, we’re making contracts for longer periods of time, 10 to 20 years.
\“That gives you good predictability of what your power costs are going to be in the future. When you have that predictability from a business perspective, it makes sense. You know what your operations costs for power will be for many years.”
\Growing in Pryor
\Google’s data center in Pryor is one of the largest of the company’s 13 data centers worldwide. It’s also the first of Google’s data centers to reach the company’s goal of producing zero landfill waste.
\In 2013, Google paid PepsiCo Inc. $24.5 million for an idled Gatorade plant next to its Mayes County industrial plant.
\The 1.4 million-square-foot former Gatorade plant is one of the largest industrial buildings in the state.
\Google has since expanded its Oklahoma data center to include a complex of four buildings, including a new four-story data center the company celebrated in September as part of a $2 billion investment Google is making in the area by 2018.
\Google has about 115 full-time Google employees in Pryor. Including contractors and part timers, the number balloons to about 500.
\“I remember when we converted the existing building on the property,” Kava said. “It was a warehouse, and we converted it to a data center. At the time, I was thinking we’d probably build a couple more of these. Now it’s way, way, way larger than that. It’s turned out to be one of our larger campuses. It’s certainly exceeded what I thought we were going to build there.”
\Google has plans to soon add another building.
\“It comes down to economics on everything,” Kava said. “We’re going to continue to expand. The last few years there was rapid expansion. I would expect the expansion won’t be as rapid in the future, but it will continue to expand. Just like all our sites, it’s a key node in our global computer and it’s a very important site to us.”
\Google receives a five year property tax exemption under the ad valorem tax incentive. The state has reimbursed local schools and counties $26.6 million over the past four years, according to Oklahoma Tax Commission records.
\Improving energy efficiency
\Besides buying renewable energy, Google also has worked to reduce its overall energy needs.
\“Using renewable energy is only one side of the coin,” Kava said. “We’ve also built the world’s most efficient data centers. The more efficient our data centers are, the more benefits we can pass on to our customers and our platform users.”
\The company has built its data centers and other buildings to maximize efficiency, using chilled water systems to cool parts of the data center and developing a computer system to take advantage of wind direction and other weather factors to heat and cool the buildings efficiently.
\“Over the past five years, we’ve achieved three and a half times more performance for every watt of power we consume,” said Chris Malone, distinguished engineer of Google’s data center research and development. “We’ve dramatically increased the performance per watt we’re getting out of our system. We’ve achieved that by owning and operating all aspects of our data centers. It gives us unique insight about how to squeeze more performance from each watt.”
\Efficiencies include improved battery backup and charging systems and using fans specially designed for Google’s data systems.
\“We’ve developed solutions based on the local conditions at each of our 13 campuses around the world,” Malone said.
\“One size fits all does not apply to data center design. We’ve taken advantage of local opportunities to get the most out of each facility.”

\What can we do? A 2006 U.N. report estimated that meat production accounts for 18 percent of man-made greenhouse gases. A 2009 article in the respected World Watch magazine suggested that the contribution may be closer to 50 percent. The meat industry generates carbon dioxide by burning forests to create animal pastures and by combustion of fossil fuels to confine, feed, transport and slaughter animals.
\The much more damaging methane and nitrous oxide are discharged from digestive tracts of cattle and from animal waste cesspools, respectively. In an environmentally sustainable world, wind, solar, and other pollution-free energy sources must gradually replace polluting fossil fuels. Similarly, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and grains must replace polluting meat and dairy products. The large variety of widely available plant-based entrees, lunch meats, veggie burgers, cheeses and ice creams can certainly help. Our next trip to the supermarket is a great opportunity to start the transition to a sustainable world. Our favorite Internet search engine offers ample product lists, recipes and dietary tips.

37,AR,"Report: Florida Agency Banned From Using Phrase ‘Climate Change’
",NA,"Mar 9, 2015","ORLANDO, Fla. — Climate change activists blasted Florida Gov. Rick Scott on Monday for leading an “Orwellian” campaign to ban employees of the state’s lead environmental agency from using such terms as “global warming” and “climate change.”
\Despite coastal Florida’s vulnerability to storm surges and rising sea levels, the state’s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) was directed in 2011 not to use the phrases in official communications, according to a report by the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting.
\“This is embarrassing, but worse than that, it’s very worrying,” said David Hastings, a marine science professor from Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, on Florida’s west coast.
\“To have this authoritarian word control is very Orwellian, a page right out of ‘Nineteen Eighty-Four,’” he said, referring to George Orwell’s dystopian novel about widespread government surveillance.
\Former employees of the DEP detailed the unwritten policy in interviews with the nonprofit news agency, which reported the ban on Sunday.
\Employees were told not to use the phrases ‘climate change,’ ‘global warming,’ ‘sea level rise,’ or ‘sustainability,’ attorney Christopher Byrd, who worked with the DEP’s Office of General Counsel from 2008 to 2013, confirmed to Reuters.
\“Nobody questioned it. There was just a lot of snickers and internal chuckling,” Byrd said.
\The euphemism suggested to DEP employees for “sea level rise” was “coastal resiliency,” he said.
\The prohibition began after the election of Scott, a Republican, who had disputed the human impact on climate change during his 2010 campaign, according to the report.
\Concerns about climate change are widely voiced by research scientists, but questioned by conservative Republicans who oppose controls on carbon emissions blamed for causing environmental damage.
\The governor’s office and the DEP did not respond to requests for comment by Reuters. They had no official policy on the phrases, according to the FCIR report.
\Hastings was one of five climate scientists who were granted a half-hour meeting with Scott in August 2014 warning him of the threat posed by a steadily rising ocean.
\Harvey Ruvin, who chaired a sea level rise task force in Miami that delivered its findings last year, told Reuters that it was important for Florida, with about 1,000 miles of coastline, to put politics aside on the climate change issue.
\“It would be very nice if we could resolve problems simply by eliminating their titles from the dictionary,” he said.
"
38,AR,"Obama Stakes Final Two Years On Climate Change
",NA,"Nov 18, 2014","WASHINGTON — With limited time still in power, President Barack Obama is staking his final two years on climate change, pushing the issue to the front of his agenda as he seeks to leave an imprint on the world that will endure after he’s gone.
\It’s a strategy rooted not only in Obama’s long-stated concern about global warming, but also in political reality.
\Two weeks ago, Obama watched his prospects for realizing his goals on education, wages and immigration all but evaporate as voters handed his party a stinging rebuke in the midterms, putting Republicans in full control of Congress for the remainder of his presidency. But on a trip last week to Asia and Australia, Obama sought — and found — fruitful opportunities to make a lasting difference on global warming.
\In China, traditionally a U.S. adversary on environmental issues, Obama set an ambitious new target for cutting future U.S. emissions as part of a landmark deal in which China will also rein in pollution. In Australia, he pledged $3 billion to help poorer nations address changing temperatures while prodding Australia’s prime minister to stop questioning the science of climate change.
\“We’re showing there’s no excuse for other nations not to come together,” Obama said in Brisbane, where he also pressed the issue with leaders of the world’s 20 largest economies.
\The emphasis on climate isn’t all by choice.
\Although Obama has long sought to rally action against climate change, White House aides say the issue has become even more attractive after the election because it’s one where Obama has considerable leverage to act without Congress. Foreign policy is largely the domain of presidents, and at home, Obama has aggressively used his regulatory power to curb greenhouse gas emissions over fierce objections from Republicans and the energy industry.
\“President Obama has made no secret that his climate crusade will proceed irrespective of what the American people want or what other global leaders caution,” said Laura Sheehan of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, which represents the coal industry.
\Sheehan said Australia, whose prime minister rose to power promising to gut a hated carbon tax, is a “prime example” of lessons that some have learned but Obama has ignored. She warned the deal with Beijing, which allows China’s emissions to keep increasing until 2030, will stall America’s economy while China’s continues to grow “thanks to affordable, reliable power.”
\Climate change advocates said the deal with China is paving the way for a successful global climate treaty that nations are aiming to finalize next year, because it ups the pressure on reluctant, developing nations like India. They argue a successful treaty is the world’s best chance to avert the worst effects of global warming. Facing dim prospects for Senate ratification for a new treaty, the administration is considering strategies where the agreement could be labeled a voluntary expansion of a 1992 climate treaty, relying on joint political pressure to ensure countries comply with certain parts.
\Yet on the domestic front, it’s unclear how much more Obama can do alone.
\Obama said his administration shaped its new goal to cut emissions at least 26 percent by 2025 based on existing legal authorities, rather than relying on future action from Congress. But Obama has already picked the low-hanging fruit: pollution limits on U.S. power plants and emissions standards for cars and trucks, to name the big ones.
\Still, White House aides said Obama has enlisted his Cabinet secretaries to hunt for further steps he can take before the clock runs out on his presidency in early 2017. They pointed to increasing renewable fuels as one example. And on Monday, the White House launched a website— toolkit.climate.gov — to give state and local officials access to federal resources to combat the impact of global warming.
\As Obama competed for a second term in the White House in 2012, he told his top aides he considered climate change to be a key piece of unfinished business, said Stephanie Cutter, his deputy campaign manager. If he won re-election, he told them, he would take on climate head-on.
\“He sees climate policy as good economic and health policy, but also a moral obligation to future generations — including his own daughters,” Cutter said.
\Yet even some of Obama’s existing steps could well be repealed by ascendant Republicans in Congress, who also have plans to stop the president from going any further. Republicans are finding common cause with many Democrats in trying to force Obama to approve Keystone XL, a proposed pipeline that would carry tar sands oil from Canada to the Texas Gulf Coast. And with the GOP set to take over the Senate in January, Republicans are already pursuing a concerted effort to gut his Environmental Protection Agency’s rules on power plants, although Obama counselor John Podesta predicted they won’t succeed.
\“The president will complete action. It’s a top priority of his,” Podesta said Monday. “And I don’t believe they can stop us from doing that.”

39,AR,"Report: Climate Change Imperils Nation’s Historical, Cultural Landmarks
",NA,"May 20, 2014","WASHINGTON — Saying there’s a “race against time,” an advocacy group reported this week that climate change — leading to sea level rise and worsening wildfires — is putting some of the nation’s most significant historical sites at risk.
\Highlighting archaeological and other historical sites in several states, a report released Tuesday by the Union of Concerned Scientists said that rising waters and raging flames could endanger some of the nation’s most-cherished locations.
\“You can almost trace the history of the United States through these sites,” Adam Markham, director of climate impacts at the Union of Concerned Scientists and a co-author of the report, said in a statement. “The imminent risks to these sites and the artifacts they contain threaten to pull apart the quilt that tells the story of the nation’s heritage and history.”
\Among the 30 sites at risk, according to the report:
\The huge prehistoric mounds of oyster and clam shells that dot Florida’s Gulf and Atlantic coasts. The report says Florida is one of the only places on Earth where coastal hunter-gatherers built shell structures as large and complicated as they are along Florida’s southwest coast. Across the state in Canaveral National Seashore, Turtle Mound is a massive shell structure that dates back at least 1,200 years. In both places, rising seas and worsening storm surge are endangering the shell structures.
\In St. Augustine, Fla., sea level rise, erosion and worsening storm surge threaten landmarks in the oldest city in the nation. The city, on the Atlantic coast, was the seat of Spanish rule in North America for 200 years. Without major engineering feats, the Castillo de San Marcos fort likely will become inaccessible if sea levels rise 3 feet; a major report earlier this month about climate change projected that sea levels could rise 1 to 4 feet by 2100.
\In California, Groveland and other Gold Rush-era towns are imperiled by wildfires. Citing a marked increase in giant wildfires, the report says climate change has driven up temperatures, caused earlier melting of winter snowpack and made forests drier for longer periods — making them ripe for fire. The report singles out Groveland, a town near Yosemite National Park that was imperiled by the devastating Rim fire in 2013.
\Other locations highlighted by the group include the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse in North Carolina; the Statue of Liberty in New York; and the Old and Historic District of Charleston, S.C. At Cape Hatteras and the Statue of Liberty, steps already have been taken to make the sites more resilient to climate change.
\Headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., the Union of Concerned Scientists is a nonprofit research and advocacy organization that seeks to “create innovative, practical solutions for a healthy, safe, and sustainable future,” according to its website.
\The report in many ways echoes the U.S. National Climate Assessment, a major assessment released to a blizzard of attention earlier this month. That report was overseen by federal officials and represented the views of more than 300 experts and top Obama administration officials; it was instantly attacked by climate change skeptics, who accused the report of overreach.
\In it, scientists detailed how climate change already has affected many parts of the country. The new report this week zeroed in on the current or potential impact on historical sites.

0,CO,"For coal miners and their families, transition to renewable energy has real consequences
",JACOB SMITH ,"June 16, 2017","Environmental community needs to be on front lines protecting coal miners’ pensions and demanding a powerful safety net to support those whose jobs are vanishing
\Earlier this month, the Tri-State electric utility announced the closure of the New Horizon coal mine in western Colorado.
\From a climate change and environmental perspective, this is good news. One less coal mine (and the eventual closure of the nearby Nucla coal-fired power plant) will mean reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality for Western Slope residents, and fewer people dying in mining accidents or suffering long-term health impacts from exposure to coal dust. And if we in Colorado hope to remain economically competitive in the 21st century, especially as the federal government cedes global renewable energy leadership to China and Europe, Colorado must transform its energy system as quickly as possible.
\But the closure also means some hard-working Coloradans will lose their jobs. It’s easy for this to seem abstract, but these are real people, with families and communities and hopes of a comfortable retirement after years spent doing dangerous work. Some may not find work at all, or not for a long time. Even those who do may have to relocate or accept lower wages or a reduced quality of life. The loss of these jobs may have real consequences for Nucla and other nearby communities.
\The growth in clean energy jobs can help offset the loss of coal mining jobs. Here in Colorado, more than 62,000 people work in the clean energy sector (compared to 1,000 in the coal industry) including solar panel installers, wind turbine operators, manufacturing lines, and energy efficiency services.
\But it’s too easy to celebrate the march toward clean energy without recognizing, and taking seriously, the impacts this is having on people trying to earn a living and provide for their families.
\In 1977, Barbara Kopple’s film “Harlan County, Kentucky” won the Oscar for best documentary. It depicts a bloody year-long battle between union coal miners and the Duke Power Company, which itself is a recapitulation of a nearly decade-long (and even bloodier) union-mining company war in Harlan County in the 1930s. Watching it, you can’t help but feel sympathy for the coal miners, who are struggling to ensure such basics as a wage they can live on, sick leave, and the opportunity to retire when they are too crippled by black lung disease to work anymore.
\It’s time to recognize that the coal miners of the Harlan County wars and their families, like the coal miners of today, are and always have been American heroes. Many have worked decades, often underground under dangerous conditions, and suffer from debilitating diseases with a shortened lifespan. The coal they broke up and brought to the surface, and the cheap energy it enabled, has improved the quality of life for most Americans, enabled the evolution of a modern health care system, broadly expanded educational opportunities, helped free women from backbreaking domestic work, and facilitated the creation of a vibrant middle class.
\The U.S. coal industry is dying, a victim of global economic forces and the desperate need to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. Nothing will change that, not Donald Trump’s empty promises to West Virginians, not the fantasy of “clean coal,” not the millions spent by the Koch brothers to elect fossil fuel-friendly legislators. But that doesn’t mean that people and families and communities that have given their lives to this industry deserve to be discarded. It’s not enough to say, “Don’t worry, we’ll fund some worker training programs and you can become a solar panel installer.”
\Even where there is disagreement on whether it’s time to phase out coal, or stop building new fossil fuel pipelines and export terminals, the environmental community needs to be on the front lines protecting miners’ pensions and demanding a powerful safety net to support those whose jobs are vanishing and whose communities are struggling.

1,CO,"America’s overlooked renewable energy source: Water has surprisingly bright future
",THE WASHINGTON POST,"July 28, 2016","Long before wind and solar, water was the nation’s top renewable energy source. Going back some 100 years, the United States built enormous dams — like the Depression-era Hoover Dam in Nevada — to produce tremendous amounts of energy.
\We have so many such dams that hydropower last year remained our fourth largest source of electricity overall and our single largest renewable source, providing 6 percent of Americans’ electricity. Yet it’s rarely talked about and lacks the excitement attached to other renewables. That’s in part because dams are controversial and can have major environmental consequences, affecting wildlife and altering local ecosystems. New ones also are expensive to build.
\“A lot of people, when they think about hydro, they don’t think that there’s much growth opportunity,” said Jose Zayas, who directs the Wind and Water Power Technologies Office at the Department of Energy. “We wanted to really quantify the benefits of hydro.”
\A new report from Zayas’s office takes a sweeping look at the state of U.S. hydropower and finds big potential. Based on the work of roughly 300 experts, the report published Tuesday concludes that substantial growth is possible in the sector, considerably upping the percentage of electricity that could come from non-carbon emitting sources.
\According to the report, the nation’s current hydropower has an electricity-generating capacity of about 101 gigawatts (or billion watts of instantaneous power generation) that could grow by about 50 percent by 2050. That equates to nearly 50 more gigawatts, which would add a few percentage points to hydropower’s overall contribution to U.S. electricity.
\One key reason is the number of existing dams that are not producing any electricity. “We have over 80,000 dams in our country, of which only 2,000 have power production,” Zayas said.
\Some could be equipped for generation, even as older facilities could be made much more efficient, the report notes.
\Bob Irvin, director of American Rivers, a group founded to protect the nation’s rivers, said he agrees that the country has the capacity to increase the amount of electricity generated by hydropower but that it must be done thoughtfully and cautiously.
\“How can we go forward with hydropower, recognizing that it does have adverse impacts, in terms of blocking free-flowing rivers and harming wildlife? It’s certainly better than burning fossil fuels, but it’s not without its own issues as far as climate change,” Irvin said, noting that the reservoirs created by dams can emit methane and alter local plants and wildlife. “There are definitely adverse impacts that have to be considered. . . . Whenever we build a dam, we destroy a river in one form or another.”
\Tara Moberg, a senior freshwater scientist at The Nature Conservancy, which provided input to the new report, said the group does see significant potential for more hydropower but only if it is done in a sustainable way.
\“[Hydropower] infrastructure has powered our growth for the past century, but it has come at a cost,” she said, underscoring that dams have changed river flows, blocked migratory fish and affected water quality in surrounding areas. “Those impacts have had ripple effects on the communities that depend on river resources.”
\Moberg said the hydropower of the future must look different than the hydropower of the past. For instance, there have been innovative agreements in some areas, such as on the Penobscot River in Maine, to couple the removal of older dams with enhancements to increase total electricity generation at other dams in the same area.
\The Energy Department’s definition of hydropower includes not only dams, which generate electricity when the flow of water turns enormous turbines, but also so-called hydroelectric “pumped storage.” With the latter, large volumes of water are pumped to a higher location where they have the potential to later flow downhill again, generating hydroelectric energy. The storage facility essentially operates like a battery, ready to provide power when needed.
\Current U.S. hydropower is mostly based on dams, which produce just under 80 gigawatts. Yet the new report concludes that the future could also see today’s 22 gigawatts of pumped storage increase considerably. In the Tesla era, when energy storage itself is having a major boom, it’s an attractive option.
\Finally, the report projects the possible installation of new hydropower facilities in some environments. Environmental considerations would be paramount, of course.
\Not addressed are other possible ways of one day getting energy from water, such as marine or riverine hydrokinetics — letting water flow turn turbines without the involvement of huge dams — or wave and tidal energy. These technologies are still a bit too far off, Zayas said.
\The benefits of a hydropower expansion would be considerable, the government researchers found: fewer greenhouse-gas emissions, fewer health costs from air pollution and far less water consumed in the process of cooling down power plants.
\The expansion of hydro would also further the expansion of its partners, wind and solar, the report contends.
\“It’s a really flexible generation source, significantly more flexible than say fossil, coal, significantly more flexible than nuclear, and even possibly more flexible than natural gas,” Zayas said. Plus, the intermittency of wind and solar requires the availability of other electricity sources that can switch on fast to take up the slack when the wind fails or when it isn’t so sunny.
\Despite the potential for gains highlighted in the report — which itself makes no specific policy recommendations — the hydropower industry’s growth isn’t guaranteed. Additional funding, research and technological improvements will be required. Not to mention a belief that increasing hydropower is a worthwhile endeavor, particularly given a changing climate.
\“The future of hydropower is not in building new dams. It’s in re-powering existing dams, adding power generation to those dams that don’t have it and upgrading and improving the dams that have hydropower in them,” Irwin said. “That’s the kind of future we ought to be looking at, where we can invest in responsible hydropower, while making sure we don’t destroy any of the remaining rivers we have.”

2,CO,"Trump’s budget expected to massively slash research on renewable energy – and NREL’s budget
",CHRIS MOONEY The Washington Post,"May 18, 2017","The Trump administration is expected to propose massive cuts to federal government research on wind and solar energy next week, according to current and former Energy Department officials familiar with budget discussions.
\The department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), which funds research on advanced vehicles as well as other aspects of clean energy, would face a roughly 70 percent cut in 2018, carving about $ 1.45 billion from its $2.09 billion 2017 budget.
\These planned deep cuts were first reported by Axios, which obtained an Energy Department budget document. Two officials reached by The Washington Post, one currently with the department and one a former employee knowledgeable about budget discussions, cited numbers very similar or, in some cases, identical to those in that report.
\It was unclear whether these were the final budget figures, which are expected to be released next week.
\Shaylyn Hynes, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department, declined to comment on the budget numbers, because they have not yet been made public.
\But she said Energy Secretary Rick Perry “will lead the Department of Energy in the same way he led Texas, focusing on carrying out our core agency functions efficiently and effectively while also being fiscally responsible and respecting the American taxpayer. The Department looks forward to working with Congress as the budget process continues.”
\The proposed cuts, if enacted, would reverberate dramatically at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, which has a $292 million federal budget and 2,200 employees. This research center — the incubator for the solar cell technology used by the U.S. firm First Solar — is highly dependent on research funding from EERE.
\The consequences of the proposed cuts could be wide ranging, potentially undermining the office’s SunShot Initiative, which has worked to drive down the costs of large-scale solar energy, which now runs about 7 cents per kilowatt hour. A goal of reaching 3 cents per kilowatt hour for large-scale solar electricity had been set for 2030.
\The cuts are far from becoming a reality. In recent budget negotiations, Congress funded Energy Department programs roughly on par with 2016 levels, rather than follow a Trump administration proposal to slash them deeply in the current fiscal year.
\Still, Josh Freed, vice president for the Clean Energy Program at Third Way, a public-policy think tank in Washington, said the proposals were “extremely troubling.”
\“The proposal from the White House, particularly on the clean-energy innovation side, is waving a white flag,” he said. “And it sets a tone for negotiations with Congress of having to restore funds at the very time we need to be increasing the budgets for energy innovation to drive growth.”
\The numbers are broadly consistent with those in the Trump administration’s “skinny budget,” released in March, which proposed a combined total of “approximately” $2 billion in cuts from EERE, the Fossil Energy Research and Development program, and two other offices. The total budget for the four programs was about $4 billion, so this would have meant cutting them collectively in half.
\According to Axios, the Fossil Energy Research and Development program, which conducts research on carbon capture and storage, would face a 55 percent cut and be funded at $280 million in 2018, far lower than the 2017 funding level of $618 million. That’s even though carbon capture and storage, which often goes by the name “clean coal,” has been a major Trump administration priority.
\One Energy Department official also confirmed this cut to The Post.
\Cuts to research funding for “clean coal” would appear to undermine a key administration priority — and fly in the face of what the coal industry wants. Perry recently attended a ribbon-cutting for the U.S.’s first functioning clean-coal plant in Texas.
\“The Obama administration made the biggest investment in clean-coal technology in history,” Ali Zaidi, a former Obama administration Office of Management and Budget official who is now at Stanford University, said in an email. “In contrast: This budget throws tacks in the road for coal; it’ll pump the brakes on much-needed carbon-capture technology research. Why?”

3,CO,"Can Denver cut its greenhouse-gas emissions by 80 percent? It will take 100 percent renewable energy
",BRUCE FINLEY,"Sep 6, 2017","Hitting the big target by 2050 also will require many households to heat with something other than natural gas
\Denver floated strategies on Wednesday for meeting its big climate change goal, including pushing Xcel Energy to supply electricity only from renewable sources before 2030.
\If these strategies are adopted, Denver would join Aspen, Boulder, Nederland and Pueblo among the more than 35 U.S. cities committed to using only renewable energy.
\“We understand there are cities that want to do this, and we are going to do everything we can to help them achieve their goals,” Xcel spokesman Mark Stutz said. “We are trying to work with any city that wants to go 100 percent ‘renewable’ or 100 percent ‘carbon-free.’ We believe we can get electricity at equal or less cost with renewables.”
\Xcel currently generates electricity from multiple sources — 46 percent from coal, 23 percent from wind, 25 percent from natural gas, and 6 percent from solar and hydropower. Xcel last week asked Colorado’s Public Utilities Commission to let it generate 55 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2026 (23 percent coal, 22 percent natural gas, 40 percent wind, 14 percent solar and 1 percent hydro), Stutz said.
\There has been no electricity generated inside Denver using coal since Aug. 13, when the conversion of Xcel’s Cherokee plant to natural gas was completed.
\Denver Mayor Michael Hancock has committed to an 80 percent cut in emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide, measured against 2005 levels, before 2050. Denver leaders say this will fulfill their pledge to meet the targets that nations including the United States agreed to in the Paris climate agreement — defying efforts by President Donald Trump to get the nation out of that deal.
\“We as a city, along with other leading cities, want to be part of the solution,” Denver climate and greenhouse gas program administrator Tom Herrod said. “We owe it to our community to take action and there is a clear global threat from climate change.”
\A city task force on Wednesday recommended the following strategies for meeting the goal:
\• Make sure the city receives electricity only from renewable sources by 2030.
\• Continue to shift to electric vehicles from those burning fossil fuels.
\• Shift commercial buildings and 200,000 households off natural gas to heat sources that do not lead to carbon pollution.
\City officials are seeking public comments on the strategies. They plan to fine-tune them before early next year.
\Task force member Marc Alston, a former EPA employee, said residents must convert climate-change concerns to action.
\“If you look at the projections for future temperatures in Denver and across the country, there are going to be areas that are very uncomfortable to live in and a lot of Denver residents are going to be very uncomfortable,” Alston said. “Scientists are correct in saying the time to act is now, not wait until it gets worse.”
\But Denver’s population boom — state demographers project growth of 1 percent a year — complicates efforts to address climate change. More people would require more electricity and travel and produce more waste, all leading to increased emissions of heat-trapping gases. This pollution is degrading air quality, increasing an urban “heat-island” effect and contributing to extreme weather events and changes in mountain-snowpack melt.
\At current worldwide rates of greenhouse gas pollution, Denver will face, in extreme years, 25 days where temperatures exceed 100 degrees, the city report warns.
\Health officials anticipate continued rising temperatures could double heat-related deaths by 2050, with low-income, the elderly, children and infants most at risk. Denver now ranks third among U.S. cities for the worst heat-island effect with spikes of up to 23 degrees compared with nearby rural areas. Denver also ranks among the worst U.S. cities for asthma attacks and among the worst cities for ozone air pollution.
\At the state level, Gov. John Hickenlooper also is pushing to faster action to address climate change. He issued an executive order in July compelling a greenhouse gas emissions cut before 2025 by at least 26 percent below 2005 levels and committing to the U.S. Climate Alliance of states and companies countering the Trump administration by shifting more quickly to wind and solar power.

\Re: “Study: Air pollution kills 3.3 million worldwide, may double,” Sept. 17 news story.
\Air pollution kills more than 50,000 people in the United States each year (and 3.3 million people worldwide), mostly from premature strokes and heart attacks, according to the study reported in the Thursday Denver Post. The culprits? Power plants, automobile emissions, and — surprisingly — farming activities that combine with coal plant and auto emissions to produce deadly particulates. In Western states, vehicle emissions are the top killer. These results highlight another important reason to pass national climate change legislation — besides helping stabilize the climate, it would cut coal plant and vehicle emissions. It’s a win-win solution that should appeal to anyone who breathes.

7,CO,"Colorado Energy Office, a lightning rod in the renewable energy debate, set to run out of funds despite last-ditch effort
",BRIAN EASON,"Jun 20, 2017","Without offering specifics, Gov. Hickenlooper suggested he would still try to salvage the office in some form.
\A Colorado government agency that has become a lightning rod in the debate over renewable energy and fossil fuels is poised to see its state funding expire July 1 after a last-ditch attempt to save it Tuesday ended in a partisan impasse.
\A six-lawmaker panel rejected an emergency funding request for the Colorado Energy Office from Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper that sought to extend the office’s $3.1 million budget for another year. The move would have kept the agency intact while lawmakers continue their own negotiations on the future of an office that both sides agree is needed.
\But the Joint Budget Committee vote deadlocked 3-3 along party lines, with Republicans saying they wanted to wait for more guidance from the full legislature, which last year failed to reach a compromise to avert the office’s looming funding deadline.
\“I hope that there’s some way we can come to an agreement over the next few months over what the mission of the office would be and that we could get bipartisan acceptance of that,” said Rep. Bob Rankin, a Republican budget writer from Carbondale. “We’re not there.”
\Tuesday’s vote wasn’t necessarily the final nail in the coffin for the office, which Hickenlooper has been trying for weeks to salvage. But it was a significant setback that makes its imminent demise all the more likely.
\The Energy Office today is tasked with promoting a variety of energy sources, including renewables such as wind and solar, and fossil fuels such as coal and gas. It offers energy-efficiency grants to schools and farms, and manages a popular weatherization program for low-income homeowners. It also provides grants and tax credits to help finance a variety of energy-related projects, including community solar panels and natural gas stations for alternate-fuel vehicles.
\If state funding sunsets as planned, the weatherization and natural gas fueling station programs will continue, because they’re funded entirely by federal grants. But the rest of the services the office provides would lapse and its staff would be cut — something that Hickenlooper and Democrats on the budget committee had sought to avoid with the one-year extension.
\Typically the full legislature would approve or reject such a funding request, but state law gives the Joint Budget Committee the authority to act on emergency requests when the legislature isn’t in session. Republicans on Tuesday disputed whether the lack of funding for the Energy Office constitutes an emergency.
\Senate Republicans this session sought to use the office’s statutory expiration date as leverage to reduce the agency’s focus on renewable energy, and add things like nuclear power to its mission. But the gambit angered Democrats, and ultimately, the two sides couldn’t reach an agreement to continue the office before the legislative session’s end.
\On Tuesday, lawmakers in both parties stressed that discussions on reauthorizing the office were ongoing. But pressure continues to build on the left for Hickenlooper to take unilateral measures to keep the office afloat.
\“Gov. Hickenlooper should now use any means necessary to find funding for the Colorado Energy Office in order to keep its important work moving forward,” said Amelia Myers, an energy advocate at Conservation Colorado.
\In a statement, Hickenlooper on Tuesday left the door open to salvaging the office in some form.
\“We will continue to explore all options to fund this important work,” he said, without offering specifics.
\But even if nothing’s done, don’t expect the office’s 24 employees to abruptly be fired on July 1.
\The Joint Budget Committee staff on Tuesday suggested there could be some money leftover from the current year’s budget. And, if layoffs ultimately occur, the administration would need to return to the committee to request funding for close-out costs, such as unemployment benefits and vacation payouts.

8,CO,"Nederland in line to become 42nd town in the U.S. 100% powered by renewable energy
",ALEX BURNESS,"August 13, 2017","Ned, Breckenridge likely next to join Aspen, Boulder and Pueblo on green-energy quest
\The town of Nederland is poised to become the 42nd community in the country to commit to achieving 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030.
\But Mayor Kristopher Larsen says he thinks the town can reach the target much sooner than that.
\“From what we can see with climate change and the accelerating rate of change, we don’t have 13 years to wait,” Larsen said. “I’m going to argue that we should set a goal more on the order of five years from now.”
\Nederland’s Board of Trustees meets Tuesday to consider making the commitment, and Larsen expects a unanimous approval.
\Should that happen, Nederland will become the fourth city in Colorado to commit to the 2030 target, joining Boulder, Aspen and Pueblo. Breckenridge will likely be added to that list, when its elected officials consider a resolution Aug. 22.
\This is not the first time that Nederland has attempted these kinds of targets in the past — the town recently adopted a resolution supporting the Paris climate accord — but the timing hasn’t often been right, said Eryka Thorley, of the citizen group Climate Together Nederland.
\“All of this started a long time ago, with many resolutions for renewable energy that have been proposed and approved by our Board of Trustees, but when it came down to actually implementing, there’s always been hurdles,” said Thorley, whose group pushed the current resolution.
\Nederland, like Boulder, is a customer of Xcel Energy, which complicates the town’s plan to get to its soon-to-be-adopted goal.
\Currently, renewables make up just less than a quarter of Xcel Colorado’s total energy portfolio. Even if Xcel achieves a 60 percent mark by 2030 — a best-case estimate far from a guarantee for a company committed to coal through 2070 — communities such as Nederland and Boulder will still have to bridge a large gap to reach the 2030 target.

9,CO,"House Democrats push forward goals for Colorado climate change plan
",JOEY BUNCH ,"Feb 9, 2016","State House Democrats passed a bill Tuesday to add measurable goals and deadlines to the state’s plan to fight climate change.
\Without a single Republican vote in the House, however, the bill would appear to be doomed as it moves to the Republican-led Senate.
\The legislation would keep the state on pace — “near-term, mid-term and long-term,” it states — to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that most experts say are heating up the planet.
\When Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, released his update to the 2008 Colorado Climate Action Plan in October, some environmentalists criticized it as a hollow gesture that needed more urgency.
\“What we’ve got here is a set of measurable goals,” said Rep. Diane Mitsch Bush, a Democrat from Steamboat Springs. “This is not a new policy to “do something.” It’s a policy to set goals to try to figure out where we are and how we are moving or not moving, as the case may be.”
\Rep. Gordon Kling enschmitt, R-Colorado Springs, argued that the bill gave government too much power to create and enforce rules without input from those affected the most.
\Other Republicans said it would be devastating to low-income Coloradans who could see their power bills increase as a result.
\“Let’s step back and take a deep breath and think about what we’re doing,” said Rep. Don Coram, a Republican from Montrose. “This is going to affect the jobs and the economy of rural Colorado. Let’s not move the goalposts and create a bunch of losers.”
\Republicans have said the legislation, if it passes, should continually measure economic impact of the proposals.
\Rep. Faith Winter of Westminster, who sponsored the bill with fellow Democrat Rep. Jeni Arndt of Fort Collins, pointed to the supporters of he bill.
\“A coalition of military, faith and business leaders came together to ask for a real climate plan,” Winter said. “It’s sad that every member of the Republican caucus voted no on this bill, but I’m glad to see it move forward.”

",MAX SIEGELBAUM,"Nov 16, 2016","The future of renewable energy could rely on economics
\HIGHLIGHTS
\Three environmental experts met at the capitol building to discuss the impact of politics and economics on renewable energy.
\The future of renewable energy may depend on convincing Americans it’s good for their wallets, according to a panel of experts who met at the Colorado Capitol on Wednesday.
\Environment Colorado, an environmental advocacy group, invited three experts working in various fields of renewable energy to discuss how political shifts could impact the industry and environmental protection policies. Emma Spett, campaign organizer for Environment Colorado, described how Donald Trump’s election and promise to repeal legislation targeting industrial emissions shook many in the climate action community.
\ “We weren’t concerned about the Clean Power Plan before,” Spett said. Now, they are trying to work to repair some of the fissures within the U.S., and “these shouldn’t be red and blue state principles.”
\Trump spent much of his campaign promising to revive the coal industry, which has struggled due to a shifting energy market and environmental regulations. The climate movement must seek to connect with areas where the industry has died, said Mario Molina, international director of the non-profit Climate Reality Project.
\“We failed to have a conversation about where people will fit in the new economy,” he said, calling it a single policy mindset. Molina talked about a previous campaign in Florida where conservative politicians helped reach out to communities on “values they hold,” like free market economy, as a potential model for future policy making and advocacy. Moving forward, they should “listen to people, not give these cookie-cutter answers.”
\Chris Gorrie is the campus president of the Ecotech Institute, a school devoted to training students for careers in renewable energy. He explained how formerly expensive technologies have plummeted in price: a solar panel costs substantially less than it did 10 years ago and wind turbines can save Coloradans millions of dollars. But changing the energy economy will require educating the workforce, and not just the engineers and technicians.
\“We must build a culture that values sustainability,” he said.
\Dawn Mullally recalled a visit she took to UQM, a Longmont-based company that makes electric propulsion engines for cars, buses and trucks. A company representative told her that much of their business revolved around exporting to China and other East Asian countries, not because of regulations and stringent environmental law, but because “markets drive things, not just policy.”
\Mullally, the director of air quality and transportation for the American Lung Association in Colorado, also recalled a conversation with a representative of Xcel Energy, which recently started buying and building wind farms across Colorado. Xcel did this, “because it was economically sensible.”

12,CO,"Prince Charles’ secret letters concern badgers, fish, climate change
",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,"May 13, 2015","LONDON — The Patagonian Toothfish has a friend in the future king of England — that’s one lesson from the British government’s release Wednesday of previously secret letters written by Prince Charles to government officials.
\The cache of 27 letters was the subject of a lengthy legal battle that pitted Charles’ right to privacy against the public’s right to know. The British press dubbed them the “black spider” memos, because of Charles’ cramped handwritten greetings and closings, and the British government spent years in court and hundreds of thousands of pounds trying to keep them secret.
\The letters, written a decade ago, include 10 written to then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and other top Labour Party officials.
\The sometimes quirky prince, known for his commitment to organic farming and traditional architecture, freely expresses himself on matters such as badger culling, fish protection, the readiness of the armed forces, standards for alternative medicines and the preservation of historic buildings.
\The letter-writing is controversial because as Britain’s future king, Charles is expected to remain neutral on political matters. Some could see the letters as inappropriate lobbying of the government by the heir to the throne — especially because the prince does mention sensitive topics dealing with national security matters, including the war in Iraq.
\The letters’ tone is polite and sometimes apologetic. He does not demand action.
\A 2004 missive to the fisheries minister is typical: “I particularly hope that the illegal fishing of the Patagonian Toothfish will be high on your list of priorities because until that trade is stopped, there is little hope for the poor old albatross, for which I shall continue to campaign,” Charles writes.

The encyclical, and the pope’s recent words in the U.S., put forth moral perspectives that are deeply rooted in Catholic teachings as the basis for conversation.

14,CO,"Experts fear “quiet springs” as songbirds can’t keep up with climate change
",BEN GUARINO ,"May 16, 2017","Certain migratory songbirds can’t keep pace with the shifting start of spring
\In 1962, Rachel Carson warned that pesticides, particularly DDT, would lead to springs without birdsong, as she wrote in her book “Silent Spring.” Carson’s forecast kick-started an environmental movement and was instrumental in the Environmental Protection Agency’s decision to ban the pesticides 10 years later, so her descriptions of deathly quiet did not come to pass.
\But the danger of a silent spring, according to ecologists who study birds, did not evaporate with DDT. The looming threat is not chemical but a changing climate, in which spring begins increasingly earlier – or in rare cases, later – each year.
\“The rate at which birds are falling out of sync with their environment is almost certainly unsustainable,” ecologist Stephen J. Mayor told The Washington Post. Mayor, a postdoctoral researcher at University of Florida’s Florida Museum of Natural History, echoed Carson: “We can end up with these increasingly quiet springs.”
\Certain migratory songbirds can’t keep pace with the shifting start of spring, Mayor and his colleagues wrote in a Scientific Reports study published Monday. Previous research noted that, in specific areas, some species can adjust to an earlier spring start, such as wood thrushes that breed sooner after arriving at Pennsylvania’s Laurel Highlands. But the new study was the first to survey songbirds across the entire North American continent. For 48 songbird species, the mismatch between arrival date and the onset of spring grew by an average of half a day per year between 2001 and 2012.
\Of the species studied, nine fared the worst, with a yawning gap between their arrival date and the spring shift: blue-winged warblers, eastern wood-pewees, great crested flycatchers, indigo buntings, northern parulas, rose-breasted grosbeaks, scarlet tanagers, Townsend’s warblers and yellow-billed cuckoos. In the case of the cuckoos, for instance, spring greenery started growing 1.2 days earlier per year, although the birds arrived on average 0.2 days early. Put another way, the timing mismatch increased by an average of one day annually.
\The report combined satellite data with bird sightings all over North America, splitting the continent into 120-by-120 mile sections. “The novel thing about this paper is the scale at which they are showing the effect,” said Wesley M. Hochachka, an ecologist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in New York who was not involved with this report.
\Using satellite imagery, the study authors tracked the start of green-up, the sudden burst of photosynthetic activity that begins in early spring in North America. As seen from the sky, green-up is an explosion of leaves. This brings out droves of hungry caterpillars and other plant-eating insects. These bugs are a crucial food supply for songbirds, which travel northward to eat and breed after spending the winter in South or Central America.
\This invertebrate buffet lasts for a limited time. In oak forests, for instance, insects find the young leaves quite tasty. But as the foliage ages, the oak trees deposit bitter tannin compounds in their leaves, making the plant matter difficult to digest or downright inedible. If birds’ timing is off, they may arrive to find their habitats impoverished of food.
\Songbirds leave Central or South America timed according to changes in daylight. Departure dates vary yearly, but not wildly. Meanwhile in the north, Mayor said, “time for green-up is shifting with climate change and becoming more unpredictable.” In the eastern United States, spring green-up started earlier and earlier.
\In Townsend’s warbler habitat and some other western regions, green-up was delayed later each year during the study period. The reasons for the lag are not yet fully understood, the scientists said, although Hochachka theorized that a lack of rainfall could play a role.
\The study authors also tracked when birds arrived in the north using data from Cornell University’s eBird project, a compendium of 400 million sightings submitted by birdwatchers since the early 2000s. (The citizen-science eBird program fuels North American bird research, Hochachka said, in a way no other continent can match.)
\There was some good news from these sightings, Mayor said. “At least 80 percent of the species don’t seem to be dramatically affected yet,” he said. Some songbird species may make up for lost springtime by flying north faster.
\Mayor emphasized that the researchers selected the 48 songbird species to study because they were commonly spotted. It’s harder to get reliable data on rare species that are threatened with extinction.
\The fact that scientists found nine pronounced mismatches in a relatively short timespan was notable, Hochachka said. Most studies of this type focus on smaller regions but use time scales longer than a single decade. “They have identified the really blatant cases where species’ arrivals are diverging,” he said.
\It was too early for Mayor to speculate what characteristics separated the most-mismatched nine from the other 48 species, he said. But the ecologist said he expected these bird populations to decrease because of their poor timing. He was also worried that a lack of songbirds would go beyond silent habitats.
\“If birds aren’t arriving when insects emerge in the spring, we could see things like insect outbreaks or defoliation,” he said. “There are many potential impacts that we don’t have a good handle on yet.”
\And unlike the case of “Silent Spring,” any given EPA ban cannot curb this trend. Mayor recommended that bird fans continue to contribute data to eBird, given its scientific value. “Getting outside and observing these birds is important,” he said.
\Likewise, Hochachka said, it would be difficult to directly ameliorate the impact of this mismatch. But it is still possible to make birds’ lives easier in other ways, he said, such as planting native or bird-friendly plants in our back yards.
\“There are things I think we can do in the northeast states to compensate somewhere else in the life cycle,” Hochachka said. As birds return to South and Central America along the East Coast, for instance, city lights may cause them to lose their way. Or worse, crash into windows. Reducing light pollution or installing non-reflective glass could help make the long trip a little easier.

15,CO,"Monastery near Aspen does its part to fight climate change
",SCOTT CONDON The Aspen Times,"Oct 5, 2017","Father Josef Boyle said the monks felt morally responsible to heed the pope’s call
\When Pope Francis called for “swift and unified global action” on environmental issues in May 2015, the monks at St. Benedict’s Monastery in Capitol Creek Valley took it to heart.
\The monks are installing a 202-kilowatt solar photovoltaic system at their picturesque ranch, and the system will offset 100 percent of electricity use at the chapel, retreat center and other buildings. The project is partially financed by a $75,000 grant from the Community Office for Energy Efficiency.
\Father Josef Boyle, the abbot of the 3,000-plus-acre ranch where the monastery is located, said Wednesday the monks felt morally responsible to heed the pope’s call.
\“The monastery has an interest in it partially to be environmentally safe and use the environment in the best way,” Father Josef said. “So that’s what got it going.”
\It also makes financial sense. The monastery will invest its own funds in the projects, which will pay for itself in energy savings in about 10 years, he said.

16,CO,"Pope Francis’ quixotic quest on climate change
",THE DENVER POST,"Jun 19, 2015 ","Pope Francis speaks in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican last Sunday, several days before he issued his encyclical on climate change. (Gregorio Borgia, The Associated Press)
\Pope Francis’ encyclical letter “On Care for Our Common Home” is, as advertised, an impassioned plea for the world’s leaders to take action to stave off warming of the planet. And that may be the least controversial part.
\The encyclical is also a critique of modern culture, technology, consumerism, globalization, urbanization, markets, political corruption, individualism, and even the 24/7 news and entertainment cycle.
\And this broader focus is where the pope wades into turbulent waters.
\To counter our dependence on fossil fuels, Francis calls for a “bold cultural revolution” in which people turn away from consumerism and the uncritical embrace of technology and economic growth. And while this vision has a certain appeal, it also is deeply quixotic.
\That’s not because “consumerism” is sacrosanct but because it is hard to define. At what point does the pursuit of material comfort become excessive and ethically problematic? Telling people to downsize their aspirations is not likely to be a winning strategy — or at least never has been in the past.
\Moreover, the biggest growth in greenhouse gas emissions in the past 30 years has occurred in countries that are still trying to supply their citizens with basics such as electricity. The poor of the world will not be denied a slice of the good life. And Francis wouldn’t want them to be left out, either.
\Francis criticizes those who tout economic growth and technological progress as keys to overcoming environmental problems. But technology in particular is key — and far more likely to be decisive than an elusive cultural revolution.
\Only through technology — both improved and new — will we be able to fulfill the needs and desires of people across the globe while eventually moving beyond fossil fuels.
\The pope seems to believe that a technological fix is illusory. But is it? Energy use per dollar of GDP in the U.S. and elsewhere has declined steadily for decades. And in 2014, the International Energy Agency reported a highly significant watershed: the “decoupling” of economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions.
\For “the first time in 40 years,” the agency reported, “there was a halt or reduction in emissions of the greenhouse gas that was not tied to an economic downturn.”
\The pope is on solid historical ground when he highlights the church’s longstanding commitment to stewardship of the natural world as opposed to exploitation. And he is right to point out the perils of both anthropocentrism and what he calls “biocentrism,” while decrying “the disappearance of thousands of plant and animal species which … our children will never see.”
\His broad vision is challenging. No one is likely to agree with every assertion, and many will object strenuously to some claims. But perhaps that is precisely why Francis’ encyclical is a worthy contribution to a growing debate.

17,CO,"Climate change hits Winter Olympic preparation
","EDDIE PELLS, JOHN LEICESTER ","Dec 18, 2017","Warming is forcing athletes to hunt farther from home for wintry conditions, particularly just months away from an Olympics
\SAAS-FEE, Switzerland — The athletes’ half-hour commute in the Swiss Alps — up two gondolas, then through a tunnel in the world’s highest underground train to a glacier at 11,000 feet — served up daily grim reminders that global warming is threatening their line of work.
\After exiting the train, they squelched through a field of grayish mud to reach shrinking snowfields scarred by new crevasses. Occasionally, they heard the sharp roars of glacial ice breaking off in monster chunks, then echoing across the peaks where they trained jumps, tricks and turns for the Pyeongchang Olympics. Most days, they basked in brilliant, snow-melting sunshine that bathed the whole scene in deceptive beauty.
\Another subtle but telltale indicator of climate change’s disruptive impact on winter sports: Many athletes — here 5,000 miles away from the Rockies and 3,500 miles from the Green Mountains of New England — had the letters “USA” emblazoned on their jackets. Americans once had little need to swap continents to guarantee offseason access to snow. But warming is forcing athletes to hunt farther from home for wintry conditions, particularly just months away from an Olympics.
\“Without the snow and the cold in the places in the States where it’s normally cold, we have to travel over here and find a place on a glacier to get a couple of jumps off,” said Jon Lillis, world champion in aerials skiing. “Something that terrifies every winter athlete daily is the fact that the conditions are not as good as they used to be. You see videos of people skiing on glaciers back in the ’80s and ’70s, and half of that glacier doesn’t even exist anymore.”
\Last year, the aerials team stopped water training at its headquarters in Park City, Utah, in mid-October, then sat and waited a month for snow that came late to the mountain that hosted the Winter Games 15 years ago. The World Cup season began in China, and the Americans were forced to travel there not having set foot on snow in months. The results, not surprisingly, were dismal: not a single podium and only one finish in the top 5.
\Lesson learned: This season, they uprooted to glaciers at Saas-Fee, Switzerland, and Ruka, Finland, for autumn training needed to be competitive at February’s Winter Games in South Korea.
\The hunt for offseason training spots like these is increasingly a scramble, and not just for the Americans. The hellishly named “Lucifer” heat wave that baked Europe in July and August wreaked havoc on teams’ schedules. Canadian skicross racers had to cancel plans to train on Italy’s Stelvio glacier that turned a sickly gray, rerouting to Mount Hood, Oregon, instead. Canadians endured issues elsewhere, scrubbing a planned summer training trip to Argentina because of hostile weather and extreme winds.
\France’s moguls team cut short a July training camp on its home glacier in Tignes after a crevasse opened under the course, which this year had just one jump instead of the usual two because of a shortage of snow, said team member Ben Cavet.
\He was shocked by the visible deterioration of his regular venue for summer training.
\“It’s crazy, you know? I always thought global warming was like your granddad going, ‘Oh, I used to go and ski here 20 or 30 years ago and there was more snow,'” Cavet said in an interview. “But now we really are talking eight years. I can see a huge difference. Up on the glacier, now there’s this huge cliff, you know like a big rock, that you couldn’t even see before.”
\“It is worrying, very worrying,” he added. “What scares me about global warming is that you can see that the world is suffering in some of the most beautiful places on Earth.”
\Other glaciers suffered, too:
\— Austria’s Moelltaler Glacier closed from Aug. 15-Sept. 7 because of what its operators said were “water gutters in the ice” and other safety concerns.
\— The Stubai Glacier, also in Austria, is deteriorating. U.S. coach Mike Jankowski, who brought some of the snowboarders and freeskiers there after the Saas-Fee trip, said there are concerns that some of the big buildings, drilled into the permafrost on the glacier, might not be stable for much longer.
\— Italy’s Stelvio, billed as the Alps’ largest summer skiing area, shut for 21 days in August, a sobering first since the opening of its lifts in the 1950s. Italian athletes who still came to train were hauled up on snow-cats.
\“Partly it was because of the heat,” said Umberto Capitani, in charge of the ski area. “But it’s also been three years that we’ve had very little snowfall.”
\— The Horstman Glacier in Whistler, Canada, near the 2010 Olympic Alpine venue, has deteriorated so badly that a renowned recreational snowboard camp was canceled, and other activities curtailed.
\“There used to be like nine lanes for different camps there, and now it’s five or six,” said U.S. moguls skier Troy Murphy. “We still go there. It’s still pretty good. But the amount it’s shrunk, the snow is so much lower.”
\— Glaciers of the French Alps lost an average of 25 percent of their surface area between 2003 and 2015, and the rate of shrinkage nearly tripled, according to a study being readied for publication early next year.
\French researcher Antoine Rabatel said it is “highly probable” that the same trends will show up at glaciers elsewhere in Europe, as winters get shorter and summers hotter.
\Winter sports training, he said, is “going to become harder and harder.”
\The quest for reliable spots is becoming more competitive, and securing training locales is increasingly using up coaches’ time and budgets.
\“I need to be progressive and search out new spots,” said Jankowski, who has had to add more reliable European venues to a global travel schedule that already includes trips to New Zealand and other locations in the Southern Hemisphere.
\In October, skiing and snowboard athletes from the U.S. and dozens of other nations lined up before dawn, doing warmup exercises in the dark as they waited, to squeeze aboard the first gondola up to Saas-Fee’s glacier. It also is in retreat, no longer reaching down to above the no-cars-allowed resort town, as it did in the 1930s.
\Environmentally minded athletes are wrestling with the moral dilemma of contributing to atmospheric pollution with their widening search for snow.
\“We take planes to go overseas. We take cars every day to go training,” said French snowboard-cross racer Pierre Vaultier, gold medalist at the 2014 Sochi Games. “We are not examples about how to decrease global warming.”
\U.S. gold-medal snowboarder Jamie Anderson said it’s easy to get “sucked into the system, whether you want to or not.”
\“It’s hard to get out until you consciously make the decision,” Anderson said. “With how passionate I am about snowboarding, it’s hard to make that shift.”
\Well aware of the impact snow sports are having on the environment, Burton Snowboards recently announced a series of changes aimed at diminishing its environmental footprint.
\The growing frequency of warm winters has, indeed, hurt the financial health of the industry, including ski resorts that form the backbone of the recreational side of the sport. A study commissioned by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the athletes’ group Protect Our Winters found that skier visits in New Hampshire were 17 percent lower and ski resort revenue was $54 million less in the “low-snow” winters of 2001-02 and 2006-07, as compared with higher snowfall winters of 2007-08 and 2008-09. The differences between low- and high-snow seasons in Colorado were 8 percent in visits and $154 million in revenue.
\The increased frequency of warm-weather race disruptions on the pro circuits also is causing alarm. Mild temperatures and lack of snow in Germany, Croatia and Michigan hit the 2015-16 season with multiple cancellations and venue changes. Last season began with events in Colorado and Alberta scrubbed because of lack of snow. This season’s early Alpine event in Beaver Creek, Colorado, was run on almost all man-made snow that turned glassy in the warming sunshine.
\Biathlon venues such as Ruhpolding in Germany and Ostersund, Sweden, commonly now make thousands of cubic yards of snow at the end of winter and store it through summer beneath tarps and wood chips for early-season races the next winter.
\“We used to have relatively reliable conditions at all biathlon venues around the world,” said Max Cobb, the president of U.S. Biathlon. “You can’t count on it anymore.”
\Temperatures in the 40s and 50s greeted freestyle skiers and snowboarders at their world championships in Spain last March, creating mushy conditions like those that took some of the shine off the 2014 Sochi Games and the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver.
\“It’s a scary thing right now for winter sports. There’s fewer and fewer places and all the glaciers are melting,” U.S. aerials coach Matt Saunders said in Saas-Fee. “It’s definitely getting harder and harder to get on snow early, for sure. We are having to travel further and further.”
\Scientists warn that worse is to come for winter sports, and that more warming will render proven Olympic venues unsuitable, even with greater use of artificial snow-making. Much has been said about the scarcity of snow in Beijing and surrounding areas, which will host the 2022 Winter Games, though officials have frequently brushed off the problem and promised to make enough artificial snow.
\Park City is in the mix for the 2026 and 2030 Olympics. The irony is not lost on Olympians who live there but had to travel the globe to train for Pyeongchang.
\“In my career, a lot of times, it’s been really easy to chalk things up to it being a bad winter,” said U.S. aerialist Mac Bohonnon. “But (warming is) undeniable. And the more I’ve traveled, the more I’ve seen that it’s a pretty common theme wherever you go.”

18,CO,"“Two Degrees” at the Jones Theatre parallels climate change, a life’s meltdown
",Lisa Kennedy,"Feb 23, 2017","While it won’t change the course of your politics, the play harbors an undeniable emotional resonance
\The day “Two Degrees” had its world premiere, Denver experienced a record-breaking temperature of 80 degrees. You might have thought that Mother Nature could not have offered a more apt lead-in for a review of a play about a climate scientist who’s been drafted by a college friend, now a high-ranking senator, to appear before a Senate committee. Yes, the balmy weather was a bit unnerving (if pleasing) but the Denver Center’s production of Tira Palmquist’s play proves to be far more than an issue outing.
\The play opens onto a dimly lit set to the sounds of mutually gratifying sex. Emma (Kathleen McCall) and Clay (Jason Delane) met in a D.C. hotel bar and made their way to her room. Each knows next to nothing about the other. That’s Emma’s rule. We learn why soon enough when Clay goes to the bathroom to get dressed and another man, a memory, walks into the room. This is husband Jeffrey (Robert Montano). While Emma was taking ice core measurements in Greenland, an unfathomable personal disaster took place back home in Boulder.
\The play gets its title from the notion that, according to some scientists, 2 degrees Celsius is the threshold that, once exceeded, will lead to us to irreversible environmental upheaval. For Emma, the margin of disaster turned out to be more mundane: Someone had too many drinks and there was a crash on a Colorado road.
\It is no easy task maneuvering the cataclysmic. The play’s twofold approach is impressively fluid as it moves between Emma’s past and her present, between her grief and the planet’s forewarned misery. The thaw that Emma researches threatens the way humankind lives. But the one she is experiencing epitomizes the benumbing and melting that humans go through after disastrous personal loss.
\As the men in Emma’s life, Montano keeps gainfully busy portraying Jeffrey as well as Eric, Senator Allen’s exacting chief of staff, and Malik, an extreme weather carpenter at the Greenland station. His impressive triple duty is more than economical: it underscores Emma’s fragility. “Not now, Jeffrey,” she says sharply to his apparition more than once. “Not now!” But the other men, looking like variations of her husband, gnaw at her.
\Emma is a tricky character to inhabit. As comfortable as she may be on the ice or in the home that she and Jeffrey share, she finds herself less sure-footed on D.C.’s slippery terrain. McCall is at her best capturing the character’s anxious energy, her defensive prickliness. It’s Emma’s frosted interior that occasionally begs for a more still approach.
\Sen. Allen (Kim Staunton) and Eric represent the sausage-making aspects of governance: the horse-trading, the pragmatism. Staunton imbues Sen. Allen with a easy confidence. Of course, she can work a room. Still, a slip of the tongue during a wine-fueled visit with Emma could have forced the play into too much interpersonal drama. Instead, Staunton’s get-things-done portrayal underscores just how hard-nosed she’s become since their college days. Credit, too, director Christy Montour-Larson’s deft trust in the play’s ideas and emotions and the audience’s appreciation of the subtle movements between the expansive and the taut.
\The sleek, evocative set (by Robert Mark Morgan) suggests the icy minimalism of Greenland as well as the very different chill of Washington, D.C. Charles MacLeod’s lighting — along with projections by Topher Blair — tease the set’s panes of glass and ice. You heard right, ice. The understated sound of dripping underscores the play’s global anxieties but also hints at the drip, drip, drip of emotional torment.
\As good as “Two Degrees” is at depicting the slow melt of grief, it would be a disservice to Palmquist’s ambitions to ignore the scientific and political backdrop of the play. A particularly pointed exchange finds Clay and Emma arguing the dangers or the merits of mining and drilling. Turns out Clay, such an appealing if provisional paramour, has a day job. And a quip by Sen. Allen about her colleagues being “easily bored by facts” got a hearty laugh opening night.
\The finely written swaths of dialogue about climate change aren’t likely to move opposing views dramatically nearer. But the play offers a humane argument that not only is the unmaking of life a matter of degrees, but so too, the making sense of it.
\“Two Degrees.” Written by Tira Palmquist. Directed by Christy Montour-Larson. Featuring Kathleen McCall, Jason Delane, Robert Montano and Kim Staunton. Through March 12 at the Jones Theatre Denver Performing Arts Complex, 14th and Curtis streets. Tickets at dcpa.org or 303-893-4100

19,CO,"Purple State Memo: Darryl Glenn questions climate change, sticks to the right in final days
",JOHN FRANK,"Oct 19, 2016","Is Darryl Glenn just throwing in the towel?
\The Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Colorado is finishing his campaign where it started.
\In an election forum earlier this week, Darryl Glenn questioned whether climate change is real — the kind of statement he espoused in the GOP primary but not one designed to appeal to the broad coalition he needs to defeat Democratic incumbent Michael Bennet in November.
\Glenn’s remarks — on the day ballots hit the mail in Colorado — came in response to a question at the Denver Chamber of Commerce forum Monday about the Clean Power Plan.
\“The climate is probably — could be changing,” he said, putting doubt into the broad scientific consensus behind a warming planet. “But what we have to have is a debate over our involvement with that.”
\It’s not the first time Glenn questioned the role humans play in global warming, but his statement on the main issue is about as far as he’s gone to question whether climate change even exists.
\His other prominent comment on the issue came more than six months ago amid a crowded GOP primary. In a campaign forum in Fort Lupton, Glenn questioned the scientific evidence behind climate change. ‘Show the data. Let’s have that discussion,” he told a small crowd at a restaurant in Fort Lupton.
\UPDATED 4 p.m.: Glenn has no public campaign events listed on his calendar for the final three weeks. A campaign spokeswoman earlier confirmed there are no events to attend in coming days, but now says he is attending three events in three days.
\It’s not clear why Glenn isn’t advertising his events or inviting the media to hear him speak — which raises questions about whether he’s even trying at this point given his huge deficit in the polls. Democratic rival Michael Bennet is launching a statewide bus tour Friday that he announced to the public.

20,CO,"Bill Gates Q&A on climate change: ‘We need a miracle’
",THE DENVER POST,"February 23, 2016 ","All we need is an energy miracle. No pressure, kids.
\So came the call from Bill Gates on Monday evening with the release of his annual letter. It tackles heady subjects with the billionaire’s usual optimistically sober tone. Unlike letters past, Gates aimed this year’s missive at teenagers instead of adults, arguing they’re our best shot at solving the world’s energy crisis.
\The genesis of the note was a conversation the Microsoft co-founder and his wife Melinda had with a group of high school students in Kentucky. The students wanted to know what cereals the Gates family preferred and if Bill knows how to dance the Nae Nae. They also wanted to know which superpower Bill and Melinda would pick, and that question struck a particular chord.
\The answers to the superpower question — Bill chose more energy, and Melinda chose more time — seem straightforward at first blush. They were the kinds of things that any adult desires.
\In the letter, however, Gates focuses not on being peppy for a tennis match but instead on the world’s mounting energy crisis. Melinda likewise issues a global call for improvements in gender equality that would give women more time to pursue those things they care about most.
\On the energy front, the most crucial part of the letter centers on an equation cooked up by Gates: P x S x E x C = carbon dioxide.
\He shows that changes to P (the world’s population), S (services used by each person) and E (energy) will not be dramatic enough to get carbon dioxide production down to zero — something that has to happen, according to Gates, to avoid catastrophic consequences to global warming. The factor that matters most is C (carbon dioxide produced by energy).
\Gates has talked quite a bit in the past about the need to come up with new energy technology beyond solar, wind, nuclear and all the rest. We’ll need a major development if the world is really going to change its energy equation. In the letter, though, he puts a very fine point on the idea.
\“In short, we need a miracle,” Gates writes. “When I say ‘miracle,’ I don’t mean something that’s impossible. I’ve seen miracles happen before. The personal computer. The Internet. The polio vaccine. None of them happened by chance. They are the result of research and development and the human capacity to innovate.
\“In this case, however, time is not on our side. Every day we are releasing more and more CO2 into our atmosphere and making our climate change problem even worse,” he writes. “We need a massive amount of research into thousands of new ideas—even ones that might sound a little crazy — if we want to get to zero emissions by the end of this century.”
\Ever the optimist, Gates expects just such a miracle to arrive within the next 15 years, and he expects it just might come from one of today’s teenagers.
\In the interview below, Gates expounds on his energy ideas and faith in the world’s youth. The letter goes into more detail on that subject as well as Melinda Gates’s thoughts on gender equality.
\Why did you aim the letter at the teenage audience?
\I think this younger group has a lot of advantages. They will tend to take a long-term view of things. They’re more scientific oriented and more interested in opportunities they can dream about where our generation hasn’t solved the problem, and, therefore, they can take up and surprise everybody by what they are able to do.
\With scientific innovation, you see that people in their 20s get a depth of knowledge and a willingness to look at things in a different way. So, I would say it’s likely that if an energy miracle comes in the next 15 years, key participants will be the teenagers of today.
\Why are you confident that there will be a breakthrough?
\What we need to get that probability up to be very high is to take 12 or so paths to get there. Like carbon capture and sequestration is a path. Nuclear fission is a path. Nuclear fusion is a path. Solar fuels are a path. For every one of those paths, you need about five very diverse groups of scientists who think the other four groups are wrong and crazy.
\Throughout history, it seems like we’ve turned to war and competitions with massive prizes to bring about major advances in a field. Where is the motivation to come up with this energy miracle going to come from?
\Scientific problems don’t generally just yield at the time someone comes up with a prize or something equivalent. It is true in war that if one country funds research and gets ahead of the other on ballistic targeting or machine guns, they get an advantage. So you will take whatever is on the scientific frontier and try to get an edge by financing that.
\In the energy space, there is no equivalent of when JFK said, “Let’s go to the Moon.” At that time, people understood they needed a certain kind of rocket, recovery system and landing system. There was a very straightforward path where the probability of success, given all the new technologies, was like 95 percent. They needed to integrate everything together in a super reliable way.
\This is more like the invention of the automobile. You had risk takers working on steam-powered cars and electric cars. Then, there was this dark horse where they were exploding things in these metal boxes called internal combustion. They kept blowing things up, but because of the energy density of gasoline, the private market weighed the relative merits, and two out of three approaches are footnotes in history.
\There is a $3 trillion market per year for buying energy that is bigger than any prize anyone can come up with. But the time it takes to develop this technology means you need slightly more patient capital. The normal venture capitalist model that has worked for biotech and worked for software is not quite right here.
\I do think with some tuning, the Breakthrough Energy Coalition group that we’re putting together will have some characteristics of a venture fund to invest in these breakthrough ideas.
\Are there riskier things along the lines of geoengineering that we should be trying at this point?
\Geoengineering is, at best, a backup strategy to buy ourselves time, if we don’t move quickly enough and things like the ice melting and methane release are happening in a nonlinear way that we don’t expect. I support research on geoengineering and a dialogue on geoengineering. But it really is like a fire extinguisher that puts the flames out for decades as opposed to a real solution.
\The word geoengineering also covers another class of things, like the free air capture of carbon. There is a Harvard professor named David Keith who has a startup company called Carbon Engineering that is working to build a prototype plant. The cost per ton you pull out of the air is still super high. And it is not clear that will ever become cheap.
\(Gates is an investor in Carbon Engineering.)
\That idea that energy companies tend to take a long time to develop and are not ultimately profitable seems like a hard sell for a youngster looking to make their way in the world.
\Well, they have a long time frame. And the science is pretty cool and interesting. As a percentage of young people, we don’t need a huge, huge percentage. We need less than, say, the NFL needs.
\Science in general has so many spin-off benefits in terms of what we are going to do in materials and basic understanding. We have environmental problems other than climate change, too—species extinction and lots of things going on in the ocean. There is plenty of room for science that is not quite as daunting as being the person that makes the energy breakthrough.
\Who would you hold up as a role model for teenagers these days?
\I think Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page — some of the IT people that took a risk and did amazing work that has changed the world. A few dozen more people like Elon Musk would be great.
\I don’t think that kids know enough about the people who are doing the medical breakthroughs. Hepatitis C went from being a terrible liver disease that is likely to kill you—now we have not one but multiple cures for that. The heroics and amazing work in the biology space, including medicines for poor countries and rich countries, I don’t think those get the visibility they should. But there are plenty of scientists and others that have taken on those causes.
\For the young people right now, they probably know the historic figures better than they know the present-day innovators.
\In the letter, you mention that “The Martian” was your favorite movie last year. What in particular did you like about it?
\I thought it was pretty educational, and the science- related aspects were fun. Unlike a lot of science things, they struck me as actually realistic. Usually, movies dumb down the book so much that you are almost disappointed when you see the movie. It didn’t have the full content of the book, but I thought they did a good job.
\How do you stay optimistic?
\Our deep scientific understanding of how to design alloys, how to pick catalysts on a rational basis—our ability to do science is accelerating. Science has taken us from a situation where more than a third of all kids died to a situation where 5 percent of kids die. In the next 15 years, if we do our job right, we will get that down to 2.5 percent.
\If you zoom out a little bit, and you look at the acceleration of science over the past 100 years, and the basic understanding we have gained and the tools we have, and the percentage of people in the world getting literate and getting engineering degrees, those numbers are on the constant rise.
\I think it is irrational not to be optimistic, but I admit I am disposed to be optimistic. So maybe I would misconstrue the facts if they were against me. But I think, honestly, you have to be optimistic. Look at what we are doing with food production. Look at what we are doing with health. Would you rather have cancer 10 years ago or 10 years from now?
\My favorite book is “The Better Angels of Our Nature” by Steven Pinker. As he says, there is only one thing that has gone down faster than violence, and that is our tolerance for violence. Ironically, at the period where violence is lower than ever, our disgust to how much violence there is at an all-time high.
\When the U.S. was poor, we polluted our rivers so badly. We made such a mess of this country. And then we got rich and said, “Oh God, we have to clean up the Potomac. We even have to clean up the stupid Hudson.” I mean, my God, we’re getting so picky.
\Being rich has allowed us to get disgusted at this mess that we made. We are more tasteful about things that bother us. That is the leading indicator of things that we will change. We will change our energy economy. We will change our gender imbalance because we are kind of unhappy about it.

21,CO,"JPMorgan won’t finance new coal mines that worsen climate change
",BLOOMBERG NEWS,"Mar 7, 2016","JPMorgan Chase is the latest big bank to pull back from coal.
\The bank will no longer finance new coal mines around the world and will end support for new coal-fired power plants in “high income” countries of the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development, JPMorgan said in a policy statement on its website.
\The decision puts JPMorgan on a growing list of financial institutions, including Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co., that have pledged to stop or scale back support for coal projects. It’s part of a broader divestment campaign led by environmental groups looking to move the global economy beyond fossil fuels.
\“We believe the financial services sector has an important role to play as governments implement policies to combat climate change,” JPMorgan said in the document.
\Outside of rich countries, the New York-based bank will back only coal-fired plants that have “ultra-supercritical” technology that is more efficient than conventional systems. JPMorgan will consider on a “case-by-case basis” coal plants in rich or poor nations that use technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions and prevent their release into the atmosphere.
\JPMorgan also plans to reduce its credit exposure in the “medium term” to companies that generate most of their revenue from coal mining and coal sales. The bank expects its business to reflect the “decline of coal as an energy source.”
\The bank published its updated policy statement on Friday. In 2013, in an earlier version, JPMorgan said it would reduce its exposure to companies that engage in “mountaintop mining” in Appalachia.

22,CO,"Harrop: Fighting climate change fo real
",SPECIAL TO THE DENVER POST,"Aug 11, 2015","Time to drop this “war on coal” talk. Time to ignore the hollering by coal country politicians over President Obama’s beefed-up plan to combat global warming.
\No, the Clean Power Plan will not ruin their local economies, because coal has already done that, certainly in Appalachia. Look at those barren flats where majestic mountains once stood. The coal industry lopped off the mountaintops and fouled the streams, depriving West Virginia and eastern Kentucky of a key recruiting tool for modern employers prizing a healthy environment.
\But let’s not go overly negative here. Coal did its job. It powered 20th-century America. The Appalachian coal regions gave and gave. We honor their sacrifice.
\So rather than call the new plan a war on coal, let us call it a retirement party for coal. Coal is the largest source of planet-warming gases. It must make room for 21st-century power.
\Mother Nature has already offered us a foretaste of what she has in mind should global warming go unchecked. Higher temperatures have worsened drought in the West, igniting large swaths of California, Washington and Oregon.
\Glacier National Park in northern Montana may sound like a cool, watery place. But tourists there have been abandoning their cars to flee wildfires. The glaciers themselves are melting and may be gone in 30 years.
\Flooding in other parts of the country is part of the same climate phenomenon.
\Natural gas emits about half as much carbon as does coal and can transition us to truly clean power. But the future is clearly renewable energy from such sources as the sun and wind.
\The new rules push us in that direction. They will require utilities to generate at least 28 percent of their electric power from renewable sources by 2030. (Renewables accounted for only 13 percent last year.)
\This is not mission impossible. In 2011, California mandated that 33 percent of its electricity come from renewable energy sources by 2020. California’s economy is booming — aided no doubt by all that clean-energy venture capital (almost 60 percent of America’s total) flowing into the state.
\Obama’s plan promotes a cap-and-trade system. States place a limit on greenhouse gases and let businesses buy and sell permits to emit them. This market-based approach started off as a conservative idea. Do remember that when the opposition rails against the idea as “cap and tax.”
\California already has a cap-and-trade system, and 10 other states have followed suit. At least 30 other states also have mandates for renewable energy.
\Foes will no doubt bash the Clean Power Plan as radical, but the public should know that even these stricter regulations will not save us from global warming. They will only stop a free fall into planetary catastrophe.
\What about other countries? A reasonable question. The plan will give Obama something serious to unfurl at the climate change summit this December in Paris. When the United States offers a plausible blueprint to meet the challenge, other countries, notably China, will be pressed to follow suit.
\And what about the coal regions? Appalachia has considerable natural beauty left, a great location and plenty of water. Coal-producing Wyoming has its own attractions, some quite magnificent.
\Coal is yesterday’s fuel. Give it a respectful goodbye and dry the tears.

25,CO,"Trump to reverse Obama-era order aimed at planning for climate change
","DARRYL FEARS, STEVEN MUFSON ","Aug 15, 2017","The executive order would eliminate a planning step for infrastructure related to climate change and flood dangers
\President Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that he said would streamline the approval process for building infrastructure such as roads, bridges and offices by eliminating a planning step related to climate change and flood dangers.
\Speaking in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, Trump said that the approval process for projects was “badly broken” and that the nation’s infrastructure was a “massive self-inflicted wound on our country.” Trump said that “no longer” would there be “one job-killing delay after another” for new projects. But he did not provide any proposal on how his much-promised infrastructure program would be financed or what it would include.
\The White House confirmed that the order issued Tuesday would revoke an earlier executive order by former President Barack Obama that required recipients of federal funds to strongly consider risk-management standards when building in flood zones, including measures such as elevating structures from the reach of rising water. Obama’s Federal Flood Risk Management Standard, established in 2015, sought to mitigate the risk of flood damage charged to taxpayers when property owners file costly claims.
\Climate scientists warn that sea levels will rise substantially in the coming decades, and they say that long-term infrastructure projects will probably face more frequent and serious flood risks.
\A White House official said the order will not stop “state and local agencies from using a more stringent standard if they choose.”
\The fight over flood planning comes as Congress is set in September to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program that pays insurance claims. The beleaguered program is nearly $25 billion in debt, an obligation its administrator, Roy Wright, said he can’t repay.
\Conservationists complained that the new order will weaken environmental standards that guard against flood risk. And they’ve found common cause with conservative think tanks worried about saddling the federal government with the burden of paying for flood damage in the future.
\“Taxpayers have been made to shell out hundreds of billions of dollars in disaster-related spending over the past decade, including more than $136 billion for just the two years from 2011 to 2013,” R.J. Lehmann, a senior fellow at the conservative R Street Institute, said in a statement opposing Trump’s anticipated order. “By contrast, evidence shows that every $1 spent on disaster mitigation can save $4 in post-disaster recovery and rebuilding costs.”
\“This is just another example of this administration trying to undo everything the Obama administration did, whether it makes any sense or not,” said William Robert Irvin, president of American Rivers, an advocacy and conservation group. “Directing federal agencies to ignore the impact of flooding in spending federal dollars is just a complete waste of taxpayer money and continues this administration’s head-in-the-sand approach to the perils of climate change, which is resulting in increased flooding.”
\Trump’s executive order also promised “one Federal decision” for major infrastructure projects and setting a two-year goal for completion of permitting processes. He said every project would be assigned to a lead agency that would be held “accountable” for the project.
\But many independent groups said they feared that Trump would try to limit possibilities for public comment.
\“This order will put people throughout the country at risk by allowing developers to ignore potential hazards while muzzling the public’s ability to weigh in on potentially harmful projects near their homes,” Alex Taurel, deputy legislative director of the League of Conservation Voters, said in a statement.
\The president’s action comes as no surprise. In January he signed an executive order to fulfill his goal of “expediting environmental reviews and approvals” to fast-track an effort to “fix our country, our roadways and bridges.” Too often, government and commercial projects are tangled in federal requirements, that order said. It commanded federal agencies to undertake environmental analyses with “maximum efficiency and effectiveness,” with an eye toward green-lighting projects.
\A number of organizations, such as the National Association of Home Builders, opposed Obama’s order and applauded Trump’s. The NAHB argued that the order’s requirement to raise single-family homes by two feet within a 100-year flood when they are built or substantially improved “could make many projects infeasible, due to increased construction costs and the inability to offset these costs through higher rents.”
\But the earlier order had significantly more supporters – engineers, planners and municipal managers, among others, said Laura Lightbody, flood preparedness project director for the Pew Charitable Trusts. Trump’s order “certainly from a national standpoint is a short-sighted step. This is a national policy that safeguards infrastructure . . . so why wouldn’t we make these investments with an eye toward the future?”
\Lightbody said Nashville, Tennessee, New Orleans, Louisiana, and Charlotte, North Carolina, are just three examples of cities that are building infrastructure with plans to protect it. There was considerable misunderstanding by opponents of the existing rule about what it does, she said. “There was an understanding that it would prohibit building in a flood plain. Not true,” she said. “It does require that when you’re rebuilding after a disaster you consider future flood risk.”

28,CO,"Interior nominee Ryan Zinke disputes Donald Trump on climate change
","Matthew Daly, Associated Press","Jan 18, 2017","WASHINGTON — Donald Trump’s choice to head the Interior Department on Tuesday rejected the president-elect’s claim that climate change is a hoax, saying it is indisputable that environmental changes are affecting the world’s temperature and human activity is a major reason.
\“I don’t believe it’s a hoax,” Rep. Ryan Zinke told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee at his confirmation hearing.
\ “The climate is changing; man is an influence,” the Montana Republican said. “I think where there’s debate is what that influence is and what can we do about it.”
\Trump has suggested in recent weeks he’s keeping an open mind on the issue and may reconsider a campaign pledge to back away from a 2015 Paris agreement that calls for global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
\In contradicting Trump, Zinke cited Glacier National Park in his home state as a prime example of the effects of climate change, noting that glaciers there have receded in his lifetime and even from one visit to the next.
\Still, he told Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that there is debate about how much humans have influenced the climate.
\Likely to win Senate confirmation, Zinke, 55, sketched out a variety of purposes for the nation’s vast federal lands, from hiking, hunting, fishing and camping to harvesting timber and mining for coal and other energy sources.
\The Interior Department and other U.S. agencies control almost a third of land in the West and even more of the underground “mineral estate” that holds vast amounts of coal, oil and natural gas.
\An admirer of President Theodore Roosevelt, Zinke said management of federal lands should be done under a “multiple-use” model set forth by Gifford Pinchot, a longtime Roosevelt associate and the first chief of the U.S. Forest Service.
\Zinke also pledged to tackle an estimated $12 billion backlog in maintenance and repair at national parks, saying parks and other public lands should be a key part of Trump’s infrastructure improvement plan.
\But the former Navy SEAL said his most important task at Interior will be to “restore trust” between the agency and the states and Indian tribes it serves.
\“One of the reasons why people want to sell or transfer public land is there’s no trust, because they feel like they don’t have a voice,” Zinke said, referring to elected officials and residents of many Western states. “They feel like they don’t matter. Well, they should matter.”
\Zinke has said he would never sell, give away or transfer public lands — a crucial stance in his home state of Montana and the rest of the West where access to hunting and fishing is considered sacrosanct. Zinke feels so strongly that he resigned as a delegate to the Republican National Convention last summer because of the GOP’s position in favor of land transfers to state or private groups.
\Even so, Zinke’s position on public lands came under fire this month after he voted in favor of a measure from House Republicans that would allow federal land transfers to be considered cost-free and budget-neutral, making it easier for drilling and development.
\The Interior nominee “says he’s against transfer of federal lands, but there’s a big gap between what he says and what he does in that regard,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, the nation’s oldest and largest environmental group.
\Zinke told senators Tuesday that he flatly opposes all sales or transfer of federal lands.
\Indeed, his support for public lands was a crucial reason why Zinke was chosen by Trump. The president-elect and son Donald Trump Jr. both oppose sale of federal lands. The younger Trump, an avid hunter, has taken a keen interest in Interior Department issues and played a key role in Zinke’s selection.
\Zinke also reiterated his support for coal production on federal lands as part of an all-of-the above energy strategy
\Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, the top Democrat on the energy panel, asked Zinke about modernizing the federal coal program, saying it was important “to make sure American taxpayers aren’t short-changed for the benefit of corporate interests.”
\Zinke promised to review the coal program and said he thinks taxpayers “should always get fair value,” whether it’s coal, wind power or other energy sources.
\Zinke also pledged to work with members of Congress on proposed national monuments such as the Bears Ears monument recently designated in Utah. The state’s Republican delegation fiercely opposes the monument created by President Barack Obama.
\“I think a monument, when it falls in a state, I think the state should have a say on it,” Zinke said.

30,CO,"Trump EPA nominee Scott Pruitt says climate change is no hoax
","Michael Biesecker and Matthew Daly, The Associated Press","Jan 18, 2017","WASHINGTON — Donald Trump’s choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that climate change is real, breaking with both the president-elect and his own past statements.
\In response to questions from Democrats during his Senate confirmation hearing, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt said he disagreed with Trump’s earlier claims that global warming is a hoax created by the Chinese to harm the economic competitiveness of the United States.
\“I do not believe climate change is a hoax,” Pruitt said.
\The 48-year-old Republican has previously cast doubt on the extensive body of scientific evidence showing that the planet is warming and man-made carbon emissions are to blame. In a 2016 opinion article, Pruitt suggested that the debate over global warming “is far from settled” and he claimed that “scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.”
\At the hearing before the Senate Energy and Public Works Committee, Pruitt conceded that human activity contributes “in some manner” to climate change. He continued, however, to question whether the burning of fossil fuels is the primary reason, and refused to say whether sea levels are rising.
\Pruitt’s testimony came shortly after NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a joint statement affirming that 2016 was officially the hottest year in recorded history. Studies show the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass, while the world’s oceans have risen on average nearly 7 inches in the last century.
\Pressed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to answer in detail about his beliefs about climate change, Pruitt responded that his personal opinion was “immaterial” to how he would enforce environmental laws.
\In his current post, Pruitt joined a multistate lawsuit opposing the Obama administration’s plan to limit planet-warming carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. Pruitt also sued over the EPA’s recent expansion of water bodies regulated under the Clean Water Act. It has been opposed by industries that would be forced to clean up polluted wastewater.
\The lawsuits are among at least eight pending cases Pruitt has joined against the agency he is in line to lead.
\Under questioning from Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., Pruitt said he has “every willingness to recuse” himself on a case-by-case basis if directed to do so by the EPA’s ethics office. Markey said that was not enough to reassure Americans of his objectivity, adding that Pruitt should commit to a blanket recusal.
\Pruitt said that if were confirmed by the GOP-run Senate, he would work with states and industry to return the federal watchdog to what he described as its proper role.
\“Environmental regulations should not occur in an economic vacuum,” Pruitt said. “We can simultaneously pursue the mutual goals of environmental protection and economic growth.”
\Environmentalists opposing Pruitt’s nomination cite his cozy relationships with oil and gas industry executives who have donated to his political campaigns.
\As the hearing got underway, shouting could be heard from people who were not allowed in. The room accommodated fewer than 100 people; most seats were taken by congressional staff, reporters and others who were allowed in early. Only a few seats remained for the public.
\One woman was quickly wrestled out of the room by three police officers as she pulled out a roll of yellow crime scene tape and shouted “We don’t want EPA gutted!”
\Later, a group of coal miners wearing hard hats were allowed in to show support for Pruitt. Trump has pledged to bring back tens of thousands of lost coal mining jobs once inaugurated, though he has not yet detailed how. The president-elect has also said he will “renegotiate” the international accord to reduce carbon emissions signed in Paris at the end of 2015.
\Senate Republicans uniformly praised Pruitt what they described as his robust record of enforcing environmental laws “when appropriate.” Court records show scant evidence of Pruitt acting to protect the environment in years as a state regulator.
\Shortly after Pruitt took office in Oklahoma in 2011, he disbanded the unit responsible for protecting the state’s natural resources. He reassigned his staff to file more than a dozen lawsuits challenging EPA regulations.
\Senate Democrats focused on Pruitt’s record of siding with polluters in court as he collected campaign contributions from them.
\Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., pressed Pruitt on money he raised from energy companies such as Exxon Mobil and Devon Energy, as well as the corporate “dark money” raised by groups with which he is involved that are not required to disclose their donors.
\Earlier this month, Pruitt resigned from the board of the Rule of Law Defense Fund, a Washington-based group supporting the legal agendas of GOP attorney generals that Whitehouse described as “a complete black hole into which at least $1 million goes.” In his response, Pruitt declined to provide details about whether the group’s donors included fossil fuel companies or utilities with regulatory issues before EPA.
\Though Pruitt ran unopposed for a second term in 2014, public campaign finance reports show he raised more than $700,000, much of it from people in the energy and utility industries.
\Pruitt has also faced criticism from environmentalists for failing to take any action to help curb a dramatic spike in earthquake activity in Oklahoma that scientists have linked to the underground disposal of oil and gas wastewater.
\Pruitt said his support for legal positions advocated by oil and gas companies was in the best interest of Oklahoma, which is economically dependent on the fossil fuel industry.

31,CO,"Coal mine expansion stalls in lawsuit citing climate change
",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,"Oct 26, 2015","BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — The U.S. Interior Department should not have approved the expansion of a southeastern Montana coal mine without taking a closer look at its effect on the environment, a federal judge said about a lawsuit arguing the government ignored coal’s contributions to climate change.
\Environmental groups sued the Interior Department after it approved an expansion of the Spring Creek Coal mine in 2012. The case marks the second time conservationists have used worries over climate change to successfully challenge approval of a coal mine after it had been granted.
\But unlike in the previous case involving Colorado mines, U.S. Magistrate Judge Carolyn Ostby did not explicitly name climate change as a factor in her decision issued Friday. She referred more broadly to air quality and environmental concerns, saying the government had failed to explain its thinking on the issue before granting approval and failed to seek public input.
\Ostby said work at the mine near Decker will not be shut down immediately. Rather, the judge recommended that federal officials reconsider the environmental effects of the expansion by Wyoming-based Cloud Peak Energy. The mine, which employs about 260 people, is allowed to continue operating in the meantime.
\The judge gave the government 180 days to complete its analysis and involve the public, before the mine’s approval would be vacated. U.S. District Judge Susan Watters will have the final decision.
\The 2,042-acre expansion of the Spring Creek Coal mine added 117 million tons of coal that could be mined, which would allow it to operate through at least 2022, according to court documents. Mining on those parcels already has begun.
\Spokesman Rick Curtsinger said the company was disappointed in the judge’s decision and planned to work with federal officials to defend the expansion.
\“Spring Creek Mine is an important part of America’s energy supply and Montana’s economy,” Curtsinger said.
\The Interior Department’s Office of Surface Mining and Reclamation is the lead defendant in the case. Agency Christopher Holmes did not have an immediate response to Ostby’s recommendations.
\A similar case resulting in federal officials reconsidering mining plans after they already were approved involved the Colowyo and the Trapper mines, both in Colorado. After a subsequent re-examination of the Colowyo mine, Interior officials determined burning its coal to produce electricity had “insignificant impacts” on national greenhouse gas emissions and moderate impacts on emissions in Colorado.
\A plaintiff in both cases, New Mexico-based WildEarth Guardians, mounted an aggressive legal campaign against the coal industry in recent years, challenging decisions affecting 11 mines in five states through a spate of lawsuits.
\A decision is pending in a case involving the San Juan coal mine in New Mexico. In September, lawyers for the group contested federal approval of mine plans and coal leases in four states: the Antelope and Black Thunder mines in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, the El Segundo Mine in New Mexico, the Bowie No. 2 Mine in Colorado and the Skyline Mine in Utah.
\Black Thunder, owned by St. Louis-based Arch Coal, is one of the largest coal mines in the world.
\WildEarth Guardians’ Jeremy Nichols said Ostby’s recommendation offers “another solid sign that Interior’s coal program is completely off the rails.”
\“The greenhouse gas emissions do matter, and they need to come up with solutions to limit those emissions. In the long term, that’s going to mean keeping coal in the ground,” Nichols said.
\The Northern Plains Resource Council and Western Organization of Resource Councils also were plaintiffs in the Montana lawsuit. The Billings-based groups argued that in addition to a lack of public notice and a shoddy analysis, the government had not shown that Spring Creek’s owner successfully restored previously mined lands.
\Ostby did not directly address that claim.
\Cloud Peak mined more than 17 million tons of coal from Spring Creek last year, including about 4 million tons exported to Asian markets though ports in British Columbia, according to the company’s regulatory filings.

\City officials on Wednesday said 300 charging stations for electric vehicles will be set up around metro Denver over the next two years. They’re also looking at changes in the city building code to encourage installation of more charging stations near proliferating apartments and condos.
\Lawsuit settlement money paid by Volkswagen after the diesel emissions test scandal will help fund Denver’s effort.
\Pollution from vehicles burning fossil fuels is the second largest source of Denver’s greenhouse gas emissions after emissions from heating and cooling commercial buildings, city officials said. A faster shift from vehicles running on fossil fuels to battery-powered transport also could help Denver begin to comply, after years of failure, with federal ozone air quality standards.
\Colorado residents have registered more than 10,000 plug-in vehicles, up from 1,200 four years ago. Nearly 2 percent of new vehicles sold in the state are plug-ins, city officials said. In recent years, the number of plug-in vehicles has been increasing by more than 40 percent annually. And simultaneous efforts to move away from coal-fired power plants for electricity, which release greenhouse gases, mean the environmental benefit of electric vehicles likely will increase.
\“Without electrified transportation, we cannot meet those climate goals,” Denver Environmental Health electric vehicles project chief Tyler Svitak said. “And the market is pushing us this way. People are showing demand. We are hoping to meet that demand.”
\Mayor Michael Hancock has committed the city to help meet Paris climate targets even though President Donald Trump is trying to get the nation out of that deal. Hancock championed electric vehicles in his “state of the city” speech last month and on Wednesday issued a statement referring to a city greenhouse gas reduction target of 80 percent by 2050. He called electric vehicles a  “valuable investment in both air quality and as a tool for fighting climate change.”
\“We’re hoping to move forward, with or without the support of the White House,” Svitak said. “Both collectively, and individually, cities can make a difference.”
\Gov. John Hickenlooper for years has promoted electric vehicles as alternatives to those running on gasoline and is working with other Western governors to set up battery-charging stations from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean.
\Neither Hickenlooper nor Hancock ride in a plug-in vehicle.
\But car dealers increasingly give options. There are at least 35 types of electric vehicles listed for purchase this summer, up from three in 2012. Tesla’s budget friendly Model 3 vehicles are being distributed with thousands bound for drivers in Colorado who lined up more than a year ago committing to buy them.
\State lawmakers have dangled a $5,000 tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles, which took effect in January. That’s twice as high as tax credits offered in California and a few other states. Combining that state credit with federal tax benefits, a Colorado resident buying a new plug-in car could save up to $12,500.
\The emergence of electric plug-in vehicles already has spurred installation of 160 charging kiosks in Denver. Statewide, more than 500 plugs have been installed. The best rapid-charging stations, which can fully revive a dead battery in 30 minutes, cost around $100,000.
\Most owners of plug-in vehicles charge them at home. But surveys show some fret about running out of power and that many more people would switch from from fossil fuel cars to electric plug-in cars if this “range anxiety” could be addressed.
\While some existing charging stations are not heavily used, the idea is to encourage a shift to plug-in cars by making them widely available. Proponents envision charging stations along highways every 30 to 50 miles so that nobody is marooned without power.
\Under the legal settlement following the VW scandal, VW created a subsidiary called Electrify America to install charging stations along highways and in 16 metro areas, including Denver.
\Denver officials said they cannot control Electrify America, but said they are advocating for charging at apartment buildings, grocery stores, office towers, gas stations, parks, shops, parking meters and along major transit corridors, such as the 470 beltway.

33,CO,"Donald Trump names Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma attorney general suing EPA on climate change, to head the EPA
","Chris Mooney, Brady Dennis and Steven Mufson, The Washington Post","Dec 7, 2016","In a move signaling an intention to dismantle President Obama’s climate change and environmental legacy, President-elect Trump will nominate Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of the oil and gas intensive state of Oklahoma, to head the Environmental Protection Agency.
\Pruitt has spent much of his energy as attorney general fighting against the agency he will now lead.
\Pruitt, who has written that the debate on climate change is “far from settled,” joined a coalition of state attorneys general in suing the agency’s Clean Power Plan, the principal Obama-era policy aimed at reducing the U.S.’s greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector. He has also sued, with fellow state attorneys general, over the EPA’s recently announced regulations trying to curtail the emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from the oil and gas sector.
\He has also taken on the administration in other areas, joining other Republican attorneys general in a lawsuit over Obama’s immigration policies.
\An ally of the energy industry, Pruitt also came to the defense, along with fellow Alabama attorney general Luther Strange, of oil company ExxonMobil when it fell under investigation by attorneys general from more liberal states seeking information about whether the oil giant failed to disclose material information about climate change.
\“We do not doubt the sincerity of the beliefs of our fellow attorneys general about climate change and the role human activity plays in it,” they wrote at the conservative publication National Review. “But we call upon them to press those beliefs through debate, not through governmental intimidation of those who disagree with them.”
\In an interview with the Washington Post in September, as a D.C. federal appeals court was preparing to hear arguments over the Clean Power Plan, Pruitt detailed why he had remained a leading opponent of the EPA’s efforts to curb carbon emissions by regulating power plants.
\“What concerns the states is the process, the procedures, the authority that the EPA is exerting that we think is entirely inconsistent with its constitutional and statutory authority,” he said at the time.
\Agencies such as the EPA, he said, should not be trying to “pinch hit” for Congress.
\“This is a unique approach by EPA, whether they want to acknowledge it or not,” he said of the provisions of the Clean Air Act the agency had relied upon to write new regulations. “The overreach is the statutes do no permit [EPA officials] to act in the way they are. They tend to have this approach that the end justifies the means . . .They tend to justify it by saying this big issue, this is an important issue.”
\But he added that’s where Congress should have authority, not EPA. “This is something from a constitutional and statutory perspective that causes great concern.”
\Environmental groups reacted with alarm Wednesday at the nomination.
\“Scott Pruitt has a record of attacking the environmental protections that EPA is charged with enforcing. He has built his political career by trying to undermine EPA’s mission of environmental protection,” said Fred Krupp, the president of the Environmental Defense Fund. “Our country needs – and deserves – an EPA Administrator who is guided by science, who respects America’s environmental laws, and who values protecting the health and safety of all Americans ahead of the lobbying agenda of special interests.”
\Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that “over the past five years, Pruitt has used his position as Oklahoma’s top prosecutor to sue the EPA in a series of attempts to deny Americans the benefits of reducing mercury, arsenic, and other toxins from the air we breathe; cutting smog that can cause asthma attacks; and protecting our wetlands and streams.”
\In 2014, the New York Times reported that Pruitt wrote a letter alleging that the agency overestimated air pollution from natural gas drilling, but that the letter was written by lawyers for Devon Energy, one of the state’s largest oil and gas companies.
\But industry representatives expressed satisfaction on Wednesday. “The office he headed was present and accounted for in the battle to keep EPA faithful to its statutory authority and respectful of the role of the states in our system of cooperative federalism,” said Scott Segal, head of the policy group at the lobbying and legal firm Bracewell. “Given that we are almost two decades overdue for an overhaul of the Clean Air Act, there is interest on both sides of the aisle to look at that statute.”
\Pruitt’s outlook reflects the state from which he comes: Oklahoma ranked fifth in the nation in onshore crude oil output in 2014, has five oil refineries, and is home to the giant Cushing oil storage and trading hub, where the price for the benchmark West Texas Intermediate grade is set every day. Although oil and natural gas production sagged in the 1990s and early 2000s, the surge in horizontal fracturing, or fracking, has boosted output.
\The state’s natural gas output accounts for 10 percent of the nation’s overall. For the week ended Oct. 28, there were 73 drilling rigs in operation in the state.
\The nomination suggests an extraordinarily tough road ahead for the Clean Power Plan, President Obama’s signature climate policy. However, the precise fate of the regulation most immediately turns on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which has not yet ruled in the lawsuit brought by Pruitt and his fellow attorneys general against the agency Pruitt is now named to lead.
\Dismantling the regulation if it survives the courts would not be simple, because the agency has already finalized it — meaning that it would have to go through a public review and comment process.
\However, interestingly, many of the Clean Power Plan’s signature objectives appear to have been already realized long before it came into effect. The U.S. is already burning less coal and more natural gas. In 2030, the EPA said in its final Clean Power Plan rule, coal would be reduced to providing 27 percent of the U.S.’s electricity, with natural gas at 33 percent. Yet this very year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, natural gas will provide 34 percent of U.S. electricity, and coal 30 percent.

34,CO,"Study: Climate change to push 1 in 13 species to extinction
",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,"Apr 30, 2015 ","WASHINGTON — Global warming will eventually push 1 out of every 13 species on Earth into extinction, a new study projects.
\It won’t quite be as bad in North America, where only 1 in 20 species will be killed off because of climate change or Europe where the extinction rate is nearly as small. But in South America, that forecasted heat-caused extinction rate soars to 23 percent, the worst for any continent, according to a new study published Thursday in the journal Science.
\University of Connecticut ecologist Mark Urban compiled and analyzed 131 peer-reviewed studies on species and found a general average extinction rate for the globe: 7.9 percent. That’s an average for all species, all regions, taking into consideration various assumptions about future emission trends.
\“It’s a sobering result,” Urban said.

35,CO,"Fact-checking President Trump’s claims on the Paris climate change deal
","Glenn Kessler and Michelle Ye Hee Lee, The Washington Post","Jun 1, 2017","In his speech Thursday announcing his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, President Donald Trump frequently relied on dubious facts and unbalanced claims to make his case that the accord would hurt the U.S. economy. Notably, he looked at only one side of the scale – claiming that the agreement left the United States at a competitive disadvantage, harming U.S. industries. But he often ignored the benefits that could come from tackling climate change, including potential green jobs.
\Trump also suggested that the United States was treated unfairly under the agreement. But each of the nations that signed the pact agreed to help lower emissions, based on plans they submitted. So the U.S. target was set by the Obama administration.
\The plans are not legally binding, but developing and developed countries are treated differently because developed countries, on a per capita basis, often produce more greenhouse gases than developing countries. For instance, on a per capita basis, the United States in 2015 produced more than double the carbon dioxide emissions of China – and eight times as much as India.
\Here’s a roundup of statements made by the president during his Rose Garden address.
\– – –
\“We’re getting out, but we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.”
\Each country set its own commitments under the Paris agreement, so Trump’s comment is puzzling. He could unilaterally change the commitments offered by President Barack Obama, which is technically allowed under the accord. But there is no appetite to renegotiate the entire agreement, as made clear by statements from world leaders after his announcement.
\– – –
\“China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.”
\This is false. The agreement is nonbinding, and each nation sets its own targets. There is nothing in the agreement that stops the United States from building coal plants or gives permission to China or India to build coal plants. In fact, market forces, primarily reduced costs for natural gas, have forced the closure of coal plants. China announced this year that it would cancel plans to build more than 100 coal-fired plants.
\Gary Cohn, director of Trump’s National Economic Council, recently told reporters that “coal doesn’t even make that much sense anymore as a feedstock. “Natural gas, which we have become an abundant producer, which we’re going to become a major exporter is, is such a cleaner fuel.”
\– – –
\“Compliance with the terms of the Paris accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025, according to the National Economic Research Associates. This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs – not what we need.”
\Trump cited a slew of statistics from a study that was funded by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Council for Capital Formation, foes of the Paris accord. So the figures must be viewed with a jaundiced eye.
\Moreover, the study assumed a scenario that no policy analyst expects – that the United States will take drastic steps to meet the Obama pledge of a 26 to 28 percent reduction in emissions by 2025.
\Trump also cited the impact by 2040, including a “cost to the economy” of nearly $3 trillion in lost gross domestic product. But in addition to an unrealistic scenario, that number must be viewed in context over more than two decades, so “$3 trillion” amounts to a reduction of 6 percent. The study concludes that coal usage would almost disappear, but innovation in clean energy sources would slow considerably, which also raises the cost of complying with the commitments.
\Environmentalists say greater investment in clean energy will lower costs and spur innovation. That may not be correct, either, but it demonstrates how the outcomes in models of economic activity decades from now depends on the assumptions.
\– – –
\“Even if the Paris agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree – think of that, this much – Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. Tiny, tiny amount.”
\Trump is referring to research by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in a 2015 report. Researchers found that proposed emissions cuts in the Paris plan would result in about 0.2 degrees (Celsius) less warming by 2100, if the cuts were not extended further.
\John Reilly, lead author of the report, said he “disagrees completely” with Trump’s characterization that the 0.2 degree cut is a “tiny, tiny” amount that is not worth pursuing. As a part of the deal, countries reexamine their commitments and can exceed or extend their pledges beyond 2030. The intent of the research was to say that the Paris deal was a small step and that more incremental steps need to be taken in the long run.
\“The logic that ‘This isn’t making much progress on a serious problem, therefore we’re going to do nothing,’ just doesn’t make sense to me. The conclusion should be – and our intended implication for people was – not to overly celebrate Paris, because you still have a long journey in front of you. So carb up for the rest of the trip,” Reilly said.
\– – –
\“The green fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion. Nobody else is even close. Most of them haven’t even paid anything – including funds raided out of America’s budget for the war against terrorism. That’s where they came [from].”
\It is incorrect that other countries have not contributed to the United Nations’ Green Climate Fund. In fact, 43 governments have pledged money to the fund, including nine developing countries. The countries have pledged to pay $10.13 billion collectively, and the U.S. share is $3 billion. As of May, the United States contributed $1 billion of the $3 billion it pledged.
\Trump implies that the money was taken out of the U.S. defense fund. But the U.S. contributions were paid out of the State Department’s Economic Support Fund, one of the foreign assistance programs to promote economic or political stability based on U.S. strategic interests. Republican lawmakers have criticized the use of this fund, saying Congress designated the money to prioritize security, human rights and other efforts unrelated to climate change.
\– – –
\“Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. As president, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people. The Paris accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risk and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world.”
\Trump is referring to concerns raised by White House Counsel Donald McGahn that staying in the Paris agreement would bolster legal arguments of climate advocates challenging Trump’s decision to roll back the Clean Power Plan.
\The Clean Power Plan is a flagship environmental regulatory rule of the Obama administration and proposes to cut carbon emissions from existing power plants 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. It is crucial to the U.S. meeting its carbon emissions reductions pledge in the Paris agreement. But it has been placed on hold while under litigation.
\According to Politico, McGahn raised concerns that the Paris agreement “could be cited in court challenges to Trump’s efforts to kill Obama’s climate rules. McGahn’s comments shocked State Department lawyers, who strongly reject both of those contentions, the sources said.”

36,CO,"Aspen Ideas Festival hot topics are campaign spending, climate change
",RAY MARK RINALDI The Denver Post,"July 1, 2015","ASPEN — It’s testimony to the ambition of the Aspen Ideas Festival that it would take on big topics like climate change, campaign financing and whether or not robots can take over our emotions all at once — and all before 10 a.m.
\But Wednesday morning’s sessions give a good idea of the scope of this week-long event, which brings together big thinkers and a curious audience from across the country.
\In one room, two of the country’s top legal minds, Theodore B. Olson and David Boies, sparred over the merits of the U.S. Supreme Court’s “Citizens United” decision removing the limits that corporations can contribute to political campaigns, and whether or not more regulations are in order.
\Olson argued the case, and maintains his stance: “Speech about elections is at the very, very core of the First Amendment,” and government is wrong to curtail it.
\Boies found the idea of applying constitutional rights to corporations absurd and called for further consideration of the question. “They don’t believe. They don’t eat. They don’t vote,” he said. “There’s a difference between corporations and people, and everybody knows that.”
\But, like a lot of things in Aspen, the faceoff had an insider edge. The pair have a long history together. They were famous adversaries in the landmark “Bush vs. Gore” case and then, even more famously, joined forces for a successful 2014 lawsuit challenging California’s anti-gay Proposition 8.
\Simultaneously, across the campus of the Aspen Institute, top players in the environmental movement were reporting positive results in the international fight against rising temperatures. They weren’t overly excited about the planet’s prospects, but they are optimistic that international agreements are taking place and that legislatures across the country are finally taking action.
\One of the best things to happen: Pope Francis’ recent encyclical declaring humans have a moral responsibility to fight climate change.
\“That’s going to resonate with people,” said Mark Tercek, president of the Nature Conservancy. “Even hard-core business people want to be inspired in a spiritual way.”
\That swing between optimism and pessimism defines Aspen. Good ideas abound, but they’re checked by the reality that good people have to see them through.
\That applies even to technology, and that was the set up for mathematician and physicist Edward Frankel, who gave a talk about maintaining our humanity even when machines can do a lot of our thinking for us. Will those advanced robots gain too much influence over our natural will?
\Not if we remind them who’s boss, spiritually speaking. “The only thing that will safeguard us” is when humans put feelings first, when “algorithms are at the service of humanity and not the other way around,” said Frankel.

37,CO,"“We stood there crying”: Video of emaciated polar bear seen on Canadian island kicks off discussion about climate change
","ELI ROSENBERG, The Washington Post","Dec 9, 2017","The world’s tragedies often have images that end up defining them: A five-year old screaming in Iraq after her parents were killed by U.S. soldiers. A starving child being stalked by a vulture during a ruthless famine in Sudan.
\A video released this week of an extremely emaciated polar bear has served as a similar purpose: as a rallying cry and stand-in for a largely unmitigated environmental disaster.
\The video was shot by Paul Nicklen, a nature photographer and contributor to the National Geographic magazine for the last 17 years. He is also a biologist by training and the co-founder of Sea Legacy, a nonprofit that uses storytelling and images to advocate for the environment.
\Nicklen’s video, which he shot on a trip for Sea Legacy, depicts an emaciated polar bear, its coat patchy, seemingly near death on an island in a Canadian territory inside the Arctic Circle. It searches for food in a rusted garbage can and chews what Nicklen said was an old snowmobile seat.
\And it struck a nerve: it was viewed more than 3.5 million times in posts on Nicklen’s and National Geographic’s Instagram feeds, according to metrics on the photo sharing site, before picking up news coverage from around the world.
\In his caption with the video, Nicklen wrote that his team was “pushing through their tears” while documenting the bear.
\“It’s a soul-crushing scene that still haunts me, but I know we need to share both the beautiful and the heartbreaking if we are going to break down the walls of apathy,” he wrote. “This is what starvation looks like. The muscles atrophy. No energy. It’s a slow, painful death.”
\The photo was shot on Somerset Island in the upper reaches of Canada. Nicklen and his team saw the bear and shot the video from about 400 feet away, he said. Nicklen, 49, who grew up in the region on nearby Baffin Island, said that he had never seen a bear in such poor condition before.
\“We stood there crying – filming with tears rolling down our cheeks,” he told National Geographic.
\He said that the intent behind the footage, which is set over a mournful soundtrack, was not purely journalistic. The trip he was on was part of a push to drive home the issue of climate change with Sea Legacy. Though he said that he had no definitive proof that the bear’s condition was connected to the global phenomenon, he said he wanted to show people what a starving bear looked like and let them draw their own conclusions.
\“We are a visual species,” Nicklen said in a phone interview. “He should have been a dominant bear. Why he was dying, I don’t know.”
\A shot of another emaciated polar bear taken by a photographer in 2015 raised similar questions.
\Polar bears face an existential threat from climate change due to the loss of habitat from melting sea ice, scientists believe. The populations of some 25,000 polar bears in 19 locations worldwide are forecast to decline by as much as a third in the coming decades. As their hunting and breeding grounds shrink, polar bears face an increased threat of starvation.
\More than any other animal, polar bears have become the poster animal for climate change, The Washington Post’s Cleve Wootson reported. Former Vice President Al Gore used a cartoon of an exhausted, endlessly swimming polar bear to illustrate the impact humans were having on the sea ice where the bears once hunted. And studies and government agencies continue to warn that climate change could make polar bears extinct by 2050.
\A paper, published in July, said that the higher global temperatures go the more likely polar bears are to interact with humans – and possibly attack and eat them.
\Some expressed skepticism that anything could be gleaned about the environment from one image. A commenter on the National Geographic’s Facebook page wondered about the bear’s age, when the footage was taken and what an autopsy would show.
\Dr. Donald Moore, the director of Oregon Zoo, senior science adviser to Smithsonian National Zoo and expert on polar bears, said he couldn’t tell much more about the bear’s age or condition from the video except its extreme skinniness.
\But he said that starvation was one of the results of the polar bear’s loss of icy habitats.
\“These polar bears should be riding ice somewhere,” he said. “We have seen more and more very thin polar bears in the Arctic in recent years as climate change increases in intensity and opens up more water.”
\He says that the population of about 25,000 polar bears in the wild has declined about 20 percent over the last decade or so. Bears need an immense amount of food, he said, about an average of a seal a week.
\Nicklen said that while most people were supportive of the photo, a small percentage had been offended that he had not taken more action: fed the bear or tried to save it. Or taken it out of its apparent misery.
\“It’s not like we travel around with 200-300 of pounds of seal meat when we’re walking around in the Arctic,” Nicklen said. “We knew it was going to be gut wrenching and intense and horrible.”
\Cleve R. Wootson Jr. contributed to this report.
